0,Silicon Valley Bank collapse concerns founders of color,"The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a major financial institution in the tech industry, has raised concerns among founders of color about their future funding prospects.

The bank, which provided funding to many startups in the technology industry, collapsed in the wake of a prolonged economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the impact of the bank's collapse has been felt across the tech industry at large, founders of color say that they are particularly concerned about their future prospects for funding.

""We are already faced with enormous barriers to accessing capital in this industry,"" said Stephanie Lampkin, founder and CEO of Blendoor, a company that helps companies reduce bias in the hiring process. ""Now, with the collapse of one of the biggest banks in the industry, it's only going to get worse.""

According to data from the National Venture Capital Association, just 1% of venture-backed startups have Black founders, while only 2% have Latinx founders.

These figures demonstrate the already limited access to capital that founders of color face in the tech industry. Now, with Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, many worry that they will be left with even fewer options for funding.

""Silicon Valley Bank was one of the few institutions that had shown a commitment to funding companies led by people of color,"" said Lampkin. ""Without them, it's going to be even harder for us to get the funding we need to build and grow our companies.""

Some founders of color have started to explore alternative forms of financing in the wake of the bank's collapse. For instance, some have turned to crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo to raise funds for their businesses.

However, while crowdfunding can be an effective way to raise money, it's not a viable option for all companies. For example, startups that require significant amounts of capital to build and scale their products or services may not be able to achieve their fundraising goals through crowdfunding alone.

Many also worry that crowdfunding could further exacerbate existing disparities in access to capital. Historically, crowdfunding campaigns led by people of color have been less successful than those led by white founders. In part, this is due to systemic biases that exist within these platforms and the broader financial industry.

""It's not enough to just look for alternative forms of financing,"" said Lampkin. ""We need the entire industry to come together and address the underlying issues that prevent founders of color from accessing the capital we need.""

One such issue is the lack of diversity among venture capitalists, who control the vast majority of funding in the tech industry. According to a recent report from the National Venture Capital Association, just 11% of venture capital investors are women, while only 3% are Black or Latinx.

Without more diverse perspectives in the venture capital industry, it's likely that many innovative ideas from underrepresented entrepreneurs will continue to go unfunded.

To address this issue, some have called for initiatives that help to diversify the venture capital industry. For instance, some venture firms have begun setting aside funds specifically for startups led by people of color or women.

Similarly, programs like HBCUvc, an organization that provides venture capital career training to students at historically Black colleges and universities, can help to create a pipeline of diverse talent in the industry.

While these initiatives are a step in the right direction, many argue that more needs to be done to address the systemic issues that prevent founders of color from accessing capital in the first place.

""We need a fundamental shift in the culture of the industry,"" said Lampkin. ""It's not just about creating more initiatives and programs, although those are important. We need a fundamental change in the way that venture capitalists approach investing in underrepresented entrepreneurs.""

Ultimately, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank serves as a reminder of the continued challenges faced by founders of color in the tech industry. While alternative sources of funding may help to mitigate some of the effects of the bank's collapse, true progress will require a larger, industry-wide effort to address the underlying issues of bias and exclusion.

""We can't just wait for the system to change,"" said Lampkin. ""We need to be proactive in advocating for real change that will make it easier for founders of color to access the funding we need to build and grow our companies.""",1
1,Mother of young boy who shot teacher arrested in Virginia,"In a shocking turn of events, the mother of the young boy who shot a teacher in Virginia has been arrested.

According to police reports, the 7-year-old boy brought a loaded handgun to his elementary school in Harrisonburg on Tuesday and shot his first-grade teacher in the leg. Although the teacher sustained non-life-threatening injuries, the incident sent shockwaves throughout the community.

As investigators looked deeper into the incident, they discovered that the boy's mother, Lisa Harding, had allegedly left the handgun unsecured at their home. Virginia law requires firearm owners to keep their weapons locked away and out of reach of children.

According to police, Harding was arrested and charged with felony child neglect, which could land her in prison for up to five years. Harding was released on $5,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court on November 19.

This incident has once again highlighted the need for responsible gun ownership and safety measures. According to research by the National Rifle Association, nearly two-thirds of gun-related deaths in the United States are due to firearms being left unsecured or easily accessible to children.

The Harrisonburg incident also brings into question the effectiveness of school policies and procedures on handling emergency situations. While schools have drills for fires and weather emergencies, they may not have measures in place to handle active shooter situations involving young children.

The Harrisonburg school district has issued a statement saying that they will be reviewing their policies and safety protocols, and that they will be providing additional support and counseling for teachers, students, and their families affected by the incident.

Meanwhile, the teacher who was shot, Mrs. Kathleen Reed, has returned to work as she recovers from her injuries. Her bravery and dedication to her students have been widely recognized by the community, and a GoFundMe page has been set up to support her during her recovery.

The incident has also sparked a debate about gun control laws in the United States. While some argue that stricter laws are necessary to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, others contend that gun ownership is a constitutional right and that individual responsibility and safety measures are the key to preventing such tragedies.

What is clear is that this incident has had a profound impact on the community, and that there are lessons to be learned from it moving forward. Education and proper safety procedures will be crucial in preventing future tragedies, and responsible gun ownership will be key to ensuring the safety of our children.",1
2,660-mile rescue flight highlights Alaska's unique challenges,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A recent rescue mission in Alaska served as a stark reminder of the unique challenges faced by those living in the state's remote and isolated areas.

Earlier this month, a family in the town of Savoonga, located on a small island in the Bering Sea, became seriously ill with a mysterious illness. Local medical facilities were unable to determine the cause of their symptoms, and with no hospital on the island, the family needed to be transported to Anchorage for medical attention.

But Savoonga, like many rural Alaskan communities, is not easily accessible. It's only reachable by plane or boat, and with harsh weather conditions and limited transportation options, getting out in an emergency can be a daunting task.

Enter the Alaska Air National Guard. A KC-135 Stratotanker, normally used for refueling military aircraft in-flight, was sent on a 660-mile rescue mission to pick up the family and transport them to Anchorage.

""It shows the uniqueness of Alaska,"" said Maj. Michael Pruitt, the pilot of the aircraft. ""There are some challenges that we have to deal with that other states don't necessarily have to.""

The mission was not without its difficulties. The weather was frigid and the runway in Savoonga is lacking many of the navigational aids typically found at larger airports, making it more difficult for pilots to land safely.

""The weather wasn't great,"" Pruitt said. ""We had low visibility and moderate to severe icing conditions.""

Despite these challenges, the mission was successful, and the family was able to receive medical attention in Anchorage. However, the mission highlighted the need for better infrastructure and resources in remote areas of the state.

According to the Alaska Public Health Association, Alaska has some of the highest rates of disease, injury and death in the United States. Further, access to healthcare can be limited, with many remote areas lacking adequate medical facilities and personnel. These challenges are exacerbated by the harsh weather conditions often encountered in Alaska, which can make transportation difficult or impossible.

""The state of Alaska is unique in terms of its geography, the remoteness of many of its communities, and the challenges that come with that,"" said Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska's chief medical officer. ""We need to work towards ensuring that all Alaskans have access to the care they need, regardless of their location.""

Zink added that the recent rescue mission highlights the importance of investing in infrastructure and resources in remote areas of the state, including better healthcare facilities, better transportation options, and improvements to communication capabilities.

The Alaska Air National Guard has played a critical role in providing emergency medical services to remote areas of the state. Since 2018, the Guard's 176th Medical Group has been providing medical care to communities in Alaska, including providing telemedicine services to remote areas that lack doctors and other medical personnel.

But despite their efforts, challenges remain. The Guard often encounters equipment deficiencies, with older aircraft and limited funding for maintenance and upgrades. Further, the extreme weather and harsh conditions can make even routine missions dangerous and challenging.

""We face unique challenges here in Alaska that require unique solutions,"" said Brig. Gen. Robert Doerer, commander of the Alaska Air National Guard. ""We need to work together to ensure that our communities have the resources they need to thrive, even in the most remote areas of the state.""

As for the family from Savoonga, they are now recovering in a hospital in Anchorage, grateful for the efforts of the Air National Guard and the medical professionals who provided them with care.

But their story serves as a reminder of the unique challenges and needs of Alaskans living in remote areas of the state. It's clear that more needs to be done to ensure that these communities have access to the resources and infrastructure they need to thrive, regardless of their location or the harsh weather conditions they may encounter.",1
3,"Suspect in leak probe talked about God, guns and war secrets","WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former U.S. government employee, accused of leaking classified information, talked about his faith, love of guns and knowledge of sensitive national security secrets in a series of online forum posts and interviews, according to a review of his online presence by The Associated Press.

Daniel Everette Hale, 31, was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee, on Thursday and charged under the Espionage Act with leaking classified documents to a news outlet. A former Air Force intelligence analyst, Hale spent five years as an intelligence analyst for the National Security Agency (NSA) before leaving in 2013 and joining a private contractor.

In his online activity, Hale, who went by the username ""Nhale,"" discussed his support for gun rights and his admiration for the military, particularly for Special Operations forces. He also talked about his interest in technology and hacking, and his opposition to government surveillance activities.

He wrote in one post, ""I am a Christian libertarian and I believe in small government, but I also believe in a strong military and intelligence community. The key is to have a balance between individual freedoms and national security.""

Hale also expressed concern about the government's use of drones for targeted killings and criticized President Barack Obama's policy on such strikes.

In a 2013 interview with the website War Is Boring, Hale spoke about his work as an intelligence analyst and the emotional toll it took on him. He said he struggled with the knowledge that his work could lead to the deaths of innocent people.

""It's been a slow, painful realization that the actions that I took part in, in however small a way, have resulted in the deaths of thousands of people,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview. ""I'm not sure that I want to live in a world where people can be targeted by the United States of America with lethal force, without due process, with no accountability for our actions.""

Hale's arrest was linked to a series of stories by news outlet The Intercept that relied on classified documents to detail the U.S. government's drone program in Yemen and Somalia. The stories, which began running in 2015, were based on documents provided by an anonymous source.

The FBI said in court documents that Hale printed out documents while working for a government contractor and then provided them to the news outlet while serving as a volunteer at a homeless shelter in Washington. In an interview with the FBI, Hale admitted to providing the documents and said he wanted to raise public awareness about the drone program.

In one post on a social media forum in 2011, Hale wrote that he ""took the oath"" to defend the Constitution against ""all enemies foreign and domestic"" and that he was ""willing to risk everything"" to ""live free and be left alone."" He also discussed his interest in ""revolution"" and his belief in the ""right to bear arms.""

Hale's social media accounts have since been deactivated, and it's not clear if he has legal representation.

The charges against Hale are the latest in a series of prosecutions under the Espionage Act for alleged leaks of classified information. The law, which was passed in 1917 amid World War I-era fears of foreign spies, has been used increasingly in recent years to target government whistleblowers and journalists.

Critics of the law argue that it is overly broad and allows the government to stifle legitimate criticism and dissent. Supporters say leaks of classified information can harm national security and must be punished.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hale's arrest.

Government officials have said the disclosures hurt national security and endangered U.S. personnel in the field. In a statement on Thursday, Assistant Attorney General John Demers said that ""the theft, use and publication of these documents jeopardize the safety and security of Americans.""

Hale faces up to 10 years in prison for each of the five charges of violating the Espionage Act, as well as three charges of theft of government property. He is scheduled to appear in court on Friday.

Prosecutors say that Hale began communicating with journalists in 2013 while still working as a contractor. They allege that he provided a journalist with a document that was published by The Intercept in 2014 which detailed the U.S. government's involvement in a controversial drone strike that killed several individuals, including a 16-year-old American citizen.

Hale's arrest comes amid a vigorous debate in the U.S. about the balance between individual privacy and national security. The government has justified its use of surveillance programs as necessary to prevent terrorist attacks, while civil liberties advocates argue that such programs violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The ACLU, which has long been critical of the government's use of the Espionage Act, said in a statement that the charges against Hale were ""an example of how the government exploits this law to punish those who expose its actions.""",1
4,New Ram electric pickup can go up to 500 miles on a charge,"The Ram truck brand has been a dominant force in the American pickup truck market for decades. Now, the brand is making a bold move into the world of electric pickups with the launch of the new Ram electric pickup truck, and it promises to make waves in the market.

Ram’s parent company, Stellantis, unveiled the all-new electric Ram pickup truck on Tuesday, September 28. The truck, which is said to have a range of up to 500 miles (800 kilometers) on a single charge, is based on a modular electric platform developed by the automaker.

With an estimated range of 500 miles, the electric Ram pickup has the potential to shake up the industry, as no other EV pickup truck currently on the market can match that range. The longest range of any electric pickup on the market today is the 2021 Tesla Cybertruck, which has an estimated range of roughly 300 miles.

The electric Ram pickup is also said to have up to 700 horsepower and the ability to tow up to 11,000 pounds (nearly 5,000 kilograms), making it a serious contender in the pickup truck market.

However, it’s important to note that the 500-mile range is for an unspecified “future model year,” and it remains to be seen whether a production version of the electric Ram will actually achieve that range. Nonetheless, it’s an impressive figure that will undoubtedly grab the attention of potential buyers.

Stellantis has not yet released any photos or detailed specifications of the electric Ram pickup. The automaker has only released a teaser image and a brief video, showing a glimpse of what the truck could look like.

The electric Ram pickup will be built at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Michigan, which is currently being retooled to produce the electric truck. Stellantis has said that production of the electric Ram will begin in 2024, and it will be sold under the Ram brand alongside the traditional gasoline and diesel-powered Ram pickups.

Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said in a statement that the electric Ram pickup is part of the automaker’s larger electrification strategy, which includes investing billions of dollars in electric vehicle development.

“Stellantis’ electrification journey continues with the promise to bring electric mobility to the heart of the company’s strategy,” Tavares said. “The new electric Ram pickup is the latest example of our commitment to the future and to sustainable mobility.”

The launch of the electric Ram pickup comes at a time when electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular in the US. According to data from the Electric Vehicle Association of America, sales of EVs in the US have grown by over 140% in the past four years. And with the Biden administration pushing for more electric vehicles on the roads, the market for EV pickups is expected to grow in the coming years.

The electric Ram pickup represents a big bet for Stellantis, as the company looks to establish itself as a leading player in the burgeoning EV market. If the truck lives up to its promise of a 500-mile range, it could be a game-changer in the pickup truck market, and help propel the Ram brand into a new era of profitability and growth.",1
5,Bill Hader gets deep on human nature in 'Barry' final season,"In the final season of the hit HBO series 'Barry', comedian Bill Hader brings not only laughs but also a thought-provoking exploration of human nature.

Hader's character, Barry Berkman, is a former marine who becomes an assassin in Los Angeles. Throughout the series, he grapples with the morality of his violent profession and the desire to leave it behind.

In an interview with AP News, Hader discussed the deeper themes of the show's final season.

""I think ultimately the show is about human connection and how hard it is for people to connect with each other,"" Hader said. ""I think we're all looking for someone to understand us, and it's hard to find that in this world.""

The complexities of human relationships are a prevalent theme throughout the final season. Barry's girlfriend, Sally (played by Sarah Goldberg), struggles with her own identity as an actress and the expectations placed upon her by others. Meanwhile, Barry's friend and fellow assassin, Fuches (played by Stephen Root), betrays him for personal gain.

But perhaps the most significant examination of human nature comes in the form of the show's main antagonist, Esther (played by Sharon Horgan), an actress-turned-killer who shares a similar background to Barry.

""Esther is someone who's been through a lot of the same things that Barry's been through,"" Hader said. ""And yet, she's made completely different choices. It's a really interesting reflection of how we're presented with options in our lives, and how our choices define who we are.""

The character of Esther challenges Barry's own beliefs about his profession and raises questions about the nature of good and evil.

""I think ultimately the show is asking, 'Can someone who's done bad things still be a good person?'"" Hader said. ""It's not going to give an answer, but it's going to make people think about it.""

Despite the show's heavy themes, Hader also acknowledged the importance of comedy in 'Barry'. As the show's creator, executive producer, writer, and star, he uses humor to balance the darker moments.

""I always try to find the funny in the serious, and vice versa,"" Hader said. ""I think that's just how life is. There are always moments of levity in the darkest of times.""

One particular standout episode this season, ""The Mandalorian"", sees Barry attempting to make peace with an old acquaintance while also struggling to contain his anger. The episode is both hilarious and poignant, capturing the show's unique blend of comedy and drama.

Throughout its three seasons, 'Barry' has received critical acclaim for its writing, direction, and performances. The show has won multiple Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for Hader in 2018 and 2019.

As the series comes to an end, Hader reflected on the impact it has had on his career and personal life.

""I've grown so much as an actor and as a person through making this show,"" he said. ""I've learned so much about collaboration and trusting my instincts. And I've made some of the closest friendships of my life.""

While Hader has no plans for a fourth season of 'Barry', he expressed gratitude for the opportunity to tell the story over three seasons.

""I always wanted to tell a complete story with a beginning, middle, and end,"" he said. ""I feel very proud of what we've accomplished with this show.""

As fans say goodbye to 'Barry', they are left with a series that not only entertained but also challenged them to think deeper about the complexities of human nature. In the end, the show serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always room for humor and a chance for redemption.

""Barry has been an amazing journey for me, and I hope it's been the same for the viewers,"" Hader said. ""It's been an honor to bring this story to life, and I can't wait to see what people take away from it.""",1
6,Florida fight over 'baby boxes' part of bigger culture war,"In Florida, a heated debate over the use of so-called ""baby boxes"" has erupted, with supporters saying they offer a safe and anonymous way for mothers to surrender unwanted infants, while critics argue they are outdated and potentially unsafe.

The issue has become caught up in a wider culture war in the US, with conservatives portraying it as a fight for the rights of the unborn, and liberals arguing it is part of a broader battle over women's reproductive rights.

Baby boxes, also called safe havens, are usually insulated and climate-controlled containers installed at fire stations or hospitals where mothers can leave their newborns anonymously, without fear of prosecution for abandonment. They are designed to prevent cases in which newborns are abandoned in unsafe places or left to die.

Florida has had a legal safe haven law since 2000, allowing parents to leave an unharmed infant, up to 30 days old, with any on-duty employee at a hospital, emergency medical service provider, or fire station without fear of prosecution.

But some activists argue that baby boxes provide a more discreet option for mothers who cannot go to those institutions. In the last year, two baby boxes were installed in Florida, one near Pensacola and the other near New Port Richey, north of Tampa.

Supporters say the boxes can save lives, pointing to cases in other states where infants have been found abandoned and often dead. They argue that mothers with unwanted pregnancies may fear stigma or criminal charges, and a baby box provides a way for them to give up their child without ever having to identify themselves.

""Ultimately, our goal is to save lives,"" said Nick Silverio, founder of the Florida-based nonprofit A Safe Haven for Newborns, which has installed many of the boxes in the US.

However, critics say the boxes are not safe, and that there are no guarantees that the infants will receive medical attention quickly. Julie Bettinger, a bioethicist at the University of British Columbia, told Wired last year that the boxes were ""a relic of a time when we didn't have as complex a system in place to protect both the mother and the baby.""

Some critics also argue that baby boxes perpetuate the myth of mothers who are callous enough to abandon their newborns, rather than seeking help from social services or healthcare professionals, and that resources should be directed towards helping those women rather than providing baby boxes.

However, the issue in Florida has spilled over into a broader culture war, with conservative lawmakers highlighting the boxes as evidence of their support for the rights of the unborn, and liberals arguing that they are part of a wider attack on women's reproductive rights.

Last year, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill requiring girls under 18 to obtain parental consent before having an abortion, a measure that was seen as part of a broader effort to restrict abortion rights in the state. DeSantis also signed a bill prohibiting abortion after 24 weeks, except when necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or the ""substantial and irreversible impairment"" of a major bodily function.

Activists fear that the debate over baby boxes could be used as a proxy for a wider fight over abortion rights, with Republicans pushing for increasingly strict laws in the state.

""The right to life argument is a little disingenuous,"" said Rep. Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando), who opposes the use of baby boxes. ""If they were truly caring about the life of the baby or the life of the parent, they would be allocating resources to our public health infrastructure or expanding Medicaid.""

Some conservatives have even invoked the specter of infanticide, with Sen. Dennis Baxley (R-Ocala) arguing last year that the boxes were necessary to prevent the ""horrors"" of ""abortion survivors [being] tossed in the garbage by people who did not want them.""

Opponents of the boxes argue that such rhetoric is misleading and unnecessary, and that the issue should be approached with a focus on the needs of mothers and infants, rather than political posturing.

""Having debated this issue for over 20 years, my concern is that too many people talk about the boxes without talking about what women need,"" said Monica Rafie, founder of Cry for the Broken, a nonprofit that provides resources for mothers in crisis pregnancies.

Ultimately, the debate over baby boxes in Florida reflects a wider culture war in the US. The issue highlights the tensions between conservatives, who emphasize the rights of the unborn, and liberals, who argue for women's reproductive rights and support for mothers in need.

As the debate intensifies in the state, activists on both sides will continue to push for their voices to be heard, and for their vision of what constitutes justice for mothers and infants to prevail.",1
7,Dad says university failed to treat NFL veteran who shot 6,"A father in Oregon says his son, a former NFL player, was failed by the university he attended and the healthcare system after he shot six people and then killed himself in March. The incident shocked the small town of Rockford and sparked a national conversation about mental health.

The former NFL veteran, whose name has not been released, attended the state university in Rockford and was reportedly struggling with mental health issues. According to his father, the university failed to provide adequate support, and he was denied access to mental health services on multiple occasions.

In an interview with AP News, the father said, ""The university knew he was struggling, but they didn't provide the help he needed. They didn't take his mental health seriously.""

The father also claims that his son was denied access to mental health services by the local VA hospital, despite his status as a veteran.

The shooting occurred at a house party in Rockford, and six people were injured before the former NFL player turned the gun on himself. The father believes that his son's mental health issues were the root cause of the tragedy.

""He was a good kid, but he was suffering. He needed help, and he didn't get it,"" the father said.

The incident has raised questions about the treatment of mental health in the United States, particularly for veterans and athletes. The father is now calling for better access to mental health services for those who need it most.

""We need to take mental health seriously. We need to provide better resources for those who are struggling. No one should have to go through what my son went through,"" he said.",1
8,"After calls to resign, Feinstein seeks Judiciary replacement","Washington D.C. (AP) -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced today that she is seeking a replacement for her role on the committee following calls for her resignation from some in her party over her handling of the confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Feinstein, who has been the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee since 2017, faced criticism from progressive activists and some Democratic lawmakers after she praised the conduct of Chairman Lindsey Graham during the Barrett hearings, which they argued let Republicans off the hook for their rush to put Barrett on the Supreme Court before the presidential election.

Democrats had hoped that by challenging Republicans on the legitimacy of Barrett's confirmation, they could mobilize their base and rally public opinion against President Trump's nominee. But Republicans largely held together, and Barrett was confirmed by the Senate in a swift process that outraged Democrats.

Feinstein's handling of the Barrett hearings was seen as emblematic of a broader problem within the Democratic Party: a tendency to play by the old rules of Senate decorum in a deeply polarized era. Some progressives argue that Democrats must be more fiercely partisan if they want to achieve their goals, and that means being willing to bend or even break the rules if necessary.

Feinstein's announcement sets up a scramble among Democrats to fill her spot on the committee. Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island are seen as possible candidates for the role.

A number of progressive groups have been pushing for Feinstein's ouster for weeks, with some saying she is simply too out of touch with the current political moment to be an effective opposition leader. They argue that she is too measured in her approach, too cautious, and too reluctant to embrace the kind of confrontational tactics that they believe are necessary to stop the Trump administration's agenda.

Feinstein's decision to step aside from the Judiciary Committee could be seen as a sign that she is listening to those voices, and that she recognizes the need for the party to address its internal divisions if it wants to succeed in winning back control of the Senate in the coming years.

In a statement released on Monday, Feinstein said that it was time for a new generation of leaders to take over and that she looked forward to working with her colleagues to find a replacement for her on the committee.

""It's time for a change of leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee,"" Feinstein said. ""I understand the urgency of the moment, and I'm ready to provide any assistance I can to help facilitate a smooth transition.""

Feinstein's departure from the Judiciary Committee could also have important implications for the work the committee does over the next few years. The committee has been central to Republican efforts to reshape the federal judiciary over the last four years, and the Democrats are likely to push back hard against those efforts once they take control of the Senate in January.

But with Feinstein out of the picture, it remains to be seen who will step in to fill her role as the Democratic Party's chief voice on the committee. Harris, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's judicial nominees and has a high profile as a result of her vice presidential run, is seen as the most likely candidate.

Booker and Whitehouse, both of whom have been involved in questioning Trump administration nominees in past hearings, are also seen as possible candidates. But both senators are relatively junior members of the committee and may not have the same kind of clout that Harris does.

For now, it seems clear that Feinstein's departure from the Judiciary Committee will be seen as a positive development by many in the party who are eager to see a more hardline approach to the Trump administration's judicial nominees. But whether this change will be enough to turn the tide in the party's favor in the coming years remains to be seen.",1
9,Study says warming may push more hurricanes toward US coasts,"A new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change suggests that global warming could cause an increase in the number of hurricanes hitting the US coasts.

According to the study, rising sea temperatures due to climate change could lead to more intense and frequent hurricanes. The researchers used computer simulations to predict the impact of climate change on hurricane patterns in the future.

They found that the number of hurricanes that make landfall in the US could increase by up to 80% by the end of the century. In addition, the study warns that hurricane damage costs could increase by as much as 150% due to population growth and development in coastal areas.

The findings are particularly concerning given that the US is already seeing more frequent and intense hurricanes in recent years. This includes Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which caused catastrophic flooding in Houston, and Hurricane Michael in 2018 which devastated parts of the Florida panhandle.

""We're already seeing the impact of climate change on hurricane activity, and this research suggests that it's only going to get worse,"" said lead author of the study, Andrea Dutton, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The study also highlights the need for better disaster preparedness and coastal management policies. In particular, the researchers call for increased investment in infrastructure to make communities more resilient to hurricanes and other extreme weather events.

""Given the incredible damage that hurricanes can cause, it's critical that we take steps now to protect our coastal communities from the impacts of climate change,"" said Dutton.

The study comes as the US is already grappling with the devastating impacts of Hurricane Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana on August 29. The storm caused widespread power outages, flooding, and other damage, and has been linked to at least 26 deaths.

Many experts have argued that Hurricane Ida is a clear example of the need for more action on climate change. In particular, they point to the role of rising global temperatures in making hurricanes more intense and destructive.

""Climate change is having a very real impact on our weather patterns, including hurricanes,"" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. ""Unless we take bold action to reduce carbon emissions and shift to renewable energy, we can expect to see more and more devastating hurricanes in the future.""

Despite these warnings, the US government has been slow to take action on climate change. President Biden has signaled his support for ambitious climate policies such as the Green New Deal, but many of these proposals face significant opposition from Republicans and industry groups.

""The reality is that we need to take a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change,"" said Dutton. ""This includes reducing emissions, investing in renewable energy, and preparing our communities for the impacts of climate change.""

In conclusion, this new study provides yet more evidence of the urgent need to address climate change and protect our communities from the impacts of extreme weather events. Without action, we can expect to see more frequent and intense hurricanes that threaten the lives and livelihoods of people living along the US coasts.",1
10,"Musk, scientists call for halt to AI race sparked by ChatGPT","Recently, there has been growing concern among tech leaders and scientists regarding the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This concern was recently ignited by the development of the ChatGPT language model, created by OpenAI. ChatGPT has shown rapid and impressive advancements in text-based conversation and natural language processing, prompting calls for caution as to the direction such technologies are taking.

One of the most vocal critics of the push towards advanced AI is Tesla CEO Elon Musk. His concerns about the potential risks of uncontrolled AI have been well-documented. Musk has repeatedly warned that the rapid development of AI poses an existential threat to humanity, and has called on regulators to take action to prevent the uncontrolled advancement of these technologies. Musk's fears are well-founded, as advanced AI could eventually become self-aware and create significant risks to human society.

Musk's concerns were echoed in a recent op-ed published in Nature. The op-ed, written by a group of scientists, called for a halt to the AI race sparked by ChatGPT. The group argued that the development of AI technology should be done responsibly and with careful consideration for the potential risks. They emphasized that the development of AI technology should be guided by strict ethical principles, and should not be left to unregulated market forces.

The op-ed also called on the international community to take action in response to the growing concerns around AI. The group noted that the development of AI technology is currently being driven by a small number of large tech companies, which are focused solely on maximizing profit. They argued that this approach is shortsighted and highly risky, as it could lead to the rapid development of technologies that are not in the best interests of humanity.

The op-ed called for the development of a global regulatory framework that can help guide the development of AI technology. The group argued that such a framework must be created in collaboration with experts from a wide range of fields, including philosophy, law, and social sciences. The goal is to ensure that AI technology is developed in a way that is aligned with human values and ethics.

OpenAI, the organization responsible for the development of ChatGPT, has responded to the concerns raised by Musk and others. In a statement, the organization acknowledged the potential risks associated with advanced AI technology and emphasized the importance of responsible development. OpenAI noted that it has implemented strict ethical guidelines for the development of its AI technology and is committed to working with regulators and other stakeholders to ensure that AI is developed in a way that is safe and beneficial for humanity.

Despite the assurances provided by OpenAI, the concerns around the development of AI technology remain. The rapid pace of technological advancement, combined with the powerful financial incentives driving the development of AI, could lead to a world where machines are more powerful than humans. Such a scenario would pose enormous risks to humanity, including the potential for widespread job displacement, societal unrest, and even the risk of catastrophic events caused by out-of-control AI.

In conclusion, the concerns raised by Musk, scientists, and other experts regarding the rapid development of AI technology are well-founded. While the potential benefits of AI are significant, it is imperative that we proceed with caution and take into account the potential risks. We must prioritize the development of AI technologies that are aligned with human values and ethics, and we must ensure that there is a robust and coordinated global effort to regulate the development of these technologies. The AI race sparked by ChatGPT must be slowed down, and we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that AI technology is developed in a way that is beneficial to humanity.",1
11,Stiff EPA emission limits to boost US electric vehicle sales,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are set to become more commonplace on American roads thanks to increasingly strict Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission standards. The Biden administration has announced ambitious plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions and ensure the transportation sector plays its part in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This will lead to a surge in demand for electric vehicles, which produce zero emissions and help reduce harmful air pollution. Here, we take a closer look at why the EPA's emission limits will help to boost EV sales across the country.

The EPA's Impact on the Auto Industry

The EPA is responsible for enforcing the Clean Air Act, which restricts the amount of pollutants that can be emitted by vehicles. This includes carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, and nitrogen oxide and particulate matter, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. The EPA regularly updates its regulations to require automakers to produce cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Under the Obama administration, fuel efficiency standards were set to gradually increase until 2025, requiring a fleet-wide average of around 50 miles per gallon. However, the Trump administration rolled back these standards, proposing a much less aggressive fuel economy target for automakers. 

Now, under the Biden administration, the EPA is expected to toughen emissions standards once again. This is part of a broader push to address the climate crisis and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across every sector of the US economy. The EPA's regulatory power provides a unique opportunity for the Biden administration to reassert the US's leadership in international climate diplomacy and set an example for other countries to follow.

The Impact of Emissions Limits on Electric Vehicle Sales

As automakers face increasingly strict emissions standards, they will be forced to produce vehicles that emit fewer greenhouse gases and pollutants. For many, this will mean focusing on electric vehicles. EVs produce zero emissions and have the potential to significantly reduce air pollution in cities and other heavily trafficked areas. Electric vehicles also offer a range of benefits beyond their environmental impact, such as lower maintenance costs, a quieter ride, and improved driving performance.

The increasing emissions limits will thus create a strong incentive for automakers to produce more electric vehicles. Already, many manufacturers have announced plans to increase their EV production lines and phase out traditional, gasoline-powered vehicles. For example, General Motors has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2040 and transition to an all-electric product lineup by 2035.

The trend is not limited to American manufacturers either. Ford, BMW, Audi, and other global automotive manufacturers are also ramping up their electric vehicle production. Volkswagen, which was caught up in a massive emissions scandal in 2015, has pledged to invest over $30 billion in electric vehicles by 2025. Even luxury automakers such as Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are releasing electric models in response to the growing demand for sustainable transportation.

In addition to spurring automakers to produce more electric vehicles, emissions limits will also likely lead to greater consumer demand for EVs. As more Americans become aware of the health and environmental benefits of electric vehicles, they will be more likely to consider electric options when purchasing a new car. The Biden administration's commitment to promoting clean transportation, including EV incentives and charging infrastructure, will only further support this trend.

Challenges to Increased Electric Vehicle Adoption

Despite the many benefits of electric vehicles, there are still challenges to their widespread adoption. One major barrier is the higher upfront cost of electric vehicles compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars. While EVs can save drivers money in the long run through lower fuel and maintenance costs, the initial purchase price can be daunting for many consumers. Federal and state incentives, including tax credits and rebates, can help to offset these costs, but they alone may not be enough to make electric vehicles truly accessible to all Americans.

Another challenge is the availability of charging infrastructure. While electric vehicle charging stations are becoming more common, they are still not as widely available as gas stations. This can be especially problematic for those who live in rural areas or who frequently travel long distances. As the Biden administration invests in electric vehicle infrastructure, including charging stations and upgrading the electric grid, this issue should become less of a concern.

Finally, the lack of consumer knowledge about electric vehicles and their benefits is another barrier to their widespread adoption. Many Americans are simply not familiar with how electric vehicles work, how far they can travel on a single charge, or even where they can be purchased. This highlights the need for education campaigns and outreach efforts to help more Americans learn about the benefits of EV ownership.

Conclusion

Increased EPA emissions standards present a unique opportunity to transition the US auto sector towards electric vehicles, a move that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution while supporting the growth of green jobs. With vehicle manufacturers already investing heavily in the development of electric vehicles and the Biden administration committed to promoting clean transportation, the future looks bright for the EV industry. However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed, including accessibility and affordability issues as well as education campaigns to help more Americans learn about the benefits of EV ownership. Nonetheless, the EPA's tougher emissions limits will undoubtedly stimulate the adoption of more environmentally friendly vehicles and drive a shift towards a cleaner, more sustainable future.",1
12,Why Sen. Feinstein's absence is a big problem for Democrats,"The absence of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) at a critical moment in the Senate is a problem for Democrats. As the Senate prepares to confirm President Joe Biden's cabinet appointments and potentially pass major legislation, Feinstein's absence from key committees could have far-reaching consequences.

Feinstein, 87, has served in the Senate since 1992 and is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. She also sits on the Intelligence, Appropriations, and Rules committees. However, in recent weeks, she has been absent from several high-profile hearings and votes, sparking speculation about her health and ability to continue serving.

The Senator's office has denied rumors that her health is failing, but confirmed that she is reducing her Senate workload due to personal reasons. In a statement to the media, Feinstein said, ""I have had conversations with Leader Schumer about the importance of maintaining committee diversity and I agree with him. I will continue to serve as the senior Democrat on the Judiciary, Intelligence, Appropriations and Rules committees.""

Feinstein's absence from key committee meetings and votes has drawn criticism from some Democrats, who argue that she is not doing enough to push back against Republican efforts to block Biden's agenda. In particular, her absence from the Senate Judiciary Committee's recent hearing on the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for Attorney General raised eyebrows.

The hearing was marked by tough questioning from Republican senators, who tried to paint Garland as a partisan Democrat who would use his position to target conservatives. Democrats, meanwhile, tried to emphasize Garland's qualifications and his commitment to serving the rule of law.

Without Feinstein present, some Democrats argued that the committee was left without a strong voice to counter Republican attacks on Garland. ""Sen. Feinstein has always been a strong advocate for the Judiciary Committee and the rule of law,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). ""There's no question that her absence from the Garland hearing was felt.""

Feinstein's absence is particularly problematic for Democrats because of the razor-thin margin they hold in the Senate. With Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote, Democrats have a 50-50 split in the chamber. This means that they can afford to lose just one vote on any given bill or nomination.

Without Feinstein present on key committees, Democrats risk losing critical votes and even stalling important legislation. For example, the Judiciary Committee is currently considering a range of bills that would address voting rights, police reform, and immigration. Without Feinstein's support, these bills could be delayed or watered down.

Feinstein's absence also raises questions about the future of the Democratic Party in California. The Senator is up for re-election in 2024, and some progressives have already begun mobilizing to challenge her. They say that Feinstein is too centrist and out of step with the state's progressive values.

Feinstein's office has pushed back against these criticisms, arguing that she remains committed to fighting for California's interests in the Senate. ""Sen. Feinstein has always been a strong advocate for California, and she will continue to be,"" said a spokesperson. ""She understands the challenges facing our state and is working hard to address them.""

Nonetheless, some Democrats worry that the Senator's absence could be a sign of broader health issues or political weakness. Feinstein faced criticism from progressives in 2018 when she voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and her centrist views have increasingly come under fire from the left wing of the party.

If Feinstein were to resign or retire before her term ends in 2024, it could trigger a fierce competition for her seat. California Governor Gavin Newsom would be responsible for appointing a replacement, but the state's large and politically diverse population would make it difficult to satisfy all factions of the Democratic Party.

For now, Democrats are hoping that Feinstein's absence is only temporary and that she will return to full health and activity soon. In the meantime, they will need to find ways to fill the gap left by her absence and continue moving forward with their ambitious legislative agenda.

In conclusion, Sen. Feinstein's absence is a major concern for Democrats. With key committees moving forward on important legislation and nominations, her absence could stall important bills and nominations. Additionally, her absence raises questions about the future of the Democratic Party in California, and whether her seat could be up for grabs in the near future. For now, Democrats are hoping for Feinstein's speedy return, while also preparing for the possibility of a future without her.",1
13,One year until total solar eclipse sweeps US,"One year until total solar eclipse sweeps US 

In exactly one year, on April 8th, 2024, many parts of the United States will experience a once-in-a-lifetime event: a total solar eclipse. This event will begin in Mexico and travel through parts of the US, including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont before ending in Canada.

A total solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the entire sun, causing darkness during the day. This is a rare event, as it only occurs about once every hundred years in any given location. The last total solar eclipse in the US occurred in 2017, but it only passed over a narrow band in parts of Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and South Carolina.

The 2024 eclipse is expected to attract millions of people to various parts of the country. Cities along the path of totality are already preparing for the influx of visitors, with hotels and campgrounds booking up fast. Experts are predicting that this could be one of the biggest travel events in the US's history, with people from all over the world coming to witness the phenomenon.

But before you start planning your trip, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, it's important to know that not every location in the path of totality will have the same experience. The duration of totality varies depending on your location, ranging from a few seconds to over four minutes. The closer you are to the centerline of the path, the longer the duration of totality.

Additionally, it's crucial to protect your eyes during the eclipse. Looking directly at the sun, even during an eclipse, can cause permanent eye damage or blindness. It's recommended to wear ISO-certified eclipse glasses or use a solar filter on a camera or telescope. Regular sunglasses are not sufficient protection.

It's also worth noting that traffic could be a major issue, as millions of people will be traveling to witness the eclipse. Officials are urging people to plan ahead, allow extra time for travel, and be patient during the event. Camping and RV sites are expected to be in high demand, so reservations are recommended well in advance.

For those who are unable to travel to the path of totality, a partial eclipse will be visible throughout the rest of the country. While it won't be as dramatic as a total eclipse, it's still a rare and exciting event. The partial eclipse will be visible in the morning, with the exact timing depending on your location. For example, in New York City, the partial eclipse will begin at 9:25 am and end at 12:32 pm.

In addition to being a breathtaking natural event, the eclipse also has scientific significance. Scientists will be studying the eclipse to learn more about the sun's corona, the outermost layer of the sun's atmosphere. During a total solar eclipse, the corona is visible as a halo of light around the moon. Studying the corona can provide insights into the sun's magnetic fields and help us better understand space weather.

Overall, the 2024 total solar eclipse is shaping up to be an unforgettable event. Whether you plan to travel to the path of totality or observe the partial eclipse from home, it's a chance to witness one of the most awe-inspiring phenomena in the natural world. Just remember to protect your eyes, plan ahead, and enjoy the experience.",1
14,Boston adopts new building code to limit use of fossil fuels,"(Boston, MA) - The city of Boston is taking steps towards a more sustainable future by adopting a new building code that will limit the use of fossil fuels in new buildings. This is a significant move that sets a precedent for other major cities to follow suit as the world grapples with an escalating climate crisis.

The Boston City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to approve the proposal that would require new buildings to be constructed with low-emission heating and cooling systems. The code stipulates a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) a building can emit through its heating and cooling systems, lighting, and appliances.

The new code will apply to all new buildings, including large commercial buildings, and aims to significantly reduce GHG emissions across the city. It is estimated that buildings currently account for approximately 70% of Boston's GHG emissions.

Mayor Kim Janey, who signed the bill into law on Wednesday, praised the city's efforts to lead the way in promoting sustainability. ""The adoption of this new building code is a critical step towards a greener Boston and a more livable future for generations to come,"" Janey said.

The city's already-existing climate initiatives, including the Climate Action Plan and the Carbon Free Boston report, are integral to meeting the targets set in the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature increases to below 2 degrees Celsius.

The new building code will require new buildings to meet highly energy-efficient standards in addition to the low-emission heating and cooling systems. For example, new buildings that are greater than 50,000 square feet must achieve an energy use intensity (EUI) of 60 kBtu/sq.ft/year, which is lower than the current national average of 95 kBtu/sq.ft/year.

The code will also mandate a minimum percentage of on-site renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines for large buildings.

Environmental groups have welcomed the new building code as a vital step towards achieving net-zero emissions in Boston. The Massachusetts Sierra Club called it a ""model for other cities to follow"" while the Environmental Defense Fund said it represented a ""vision for a cleaner, healthier future.""

Boston is not the only city to move towards sustainable building codes. New York City has passed similar legislation, and several other cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, have pledged to follow suit.

As the world continues to grapple with the escalating climate crisis, it is clear that action at the local level is crucial to mitigating the damage. With this new building code, Boston has taken a vital step in reducing its carbon footprint and ensuring a more sustainable future.",1
15,"In Bahamas, conch fishing is way of life. But for how long?","In Bahamas, conch fishing is way of life. But for how long?

The crystal-clear waters surrounding The Bahamas are teeming with life. From colorful corals and vibrant fish to majestic sharks and gentle sea turtles, the archipelago is known for its impressive marine biodiversity. But perhaps the most iconic of its inhabitants is the queen conch.

The queen conch (Strombus gigas) is a large marine gastropod with a distinctive pink and orange shell. It is a prized delicacy and an important source of income for many Bahamians. Conch meat is a staple in traditional dishes like conch salad, conch chowder, and cracked conch. The shell is also used to make jewelry, home decor, and musical instruments.

But the future of conch fishing in The Bahamas is uncertain. Overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change are all taking a toll on the conch population, whose numbers have been declining in recent years. Some experts warn that unless measures are taken to protect the species, conch fishing might not be sustainable in the long term.

A way of life

For many Bahamians, conch fishing is more than just a source of income. It is a way of life that has been passed down through generations.

Conch fishermen, known as ""conchs"" or ""conchers,"" brave the sometimes treacherous waters of the Bahamas to hunt for the elusive gastropod. They use snorkeling gear or scuba tanks to dive down to the seafloor, where the conch live.

The process of catching a conch is a delicate one. The conch must be pried gently from its shell using a special tool called a ""conch horn."" The meat is then cleaned and prepared for cooking or sale.

Conch fishing is deeply ingrained in Bahamian culture. It is celebrated in annual festivals like the Conch Cracking Competition and the National Conch Festival, where locals and tourists alike gather to indulge in conch dishes, enjoy live music, and learn about the history and traditions of conch fishing.

But conch fishing is not just a cultural tradition—it is also an important economic activity. In 2018, The Bahamas exported $25 million worth of conch meat and products, mainly to the United States, where it is in high demand.

A dwindling population

Despite its cultural and economic importance, the conch population in The Bahamas is in trouble.

Overfishing is one of the main culprits. The demand for conch has increased in recent years, putting pressure on the already fragile population. According to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the average size of a harvested conch in The Bahamas has decreased from 178 millimeters in the 1970s to 148 millimeters in the 2010s.

The decline in size is a sign that the population is not reproducing fast enough to keep up with the fishing pressure. Queen conch reach sexual maturity at around three to four years of age, and they can live up to 30 years in the wild. But they are slow to reproduce, with females producing only one egg mass per year, each containing up to 500,000 eggs.

Illegal fishing is also a problem. Some fishermen use dynamite or other destructive methods to catch conch, causing damage to the seafloor and killing other marine creatures in the process. Others harvest undersized conch or conch during the closed season, when fishing is prohibited to allow the population to recover.

Climate change and habitat loss are exacerbating the problem. Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and severe weather events like hurricanes are all affecting the health and distribution of conch populations. The destruction of seagrass beds, which provide crucial habitat for young conch, is also a concern.

The future of conch fishing

The situation is not hopeless, but it requires urgent action from the Bahamian government and society as a whole.

One possible solution is to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) that restrict fishing in certain areas to allow the conch population to recover. MPAs have been effective in other parts of the world in promoting the recovery of fish stocks and protecting biodiversity.

The Bahamas already has several MPAs, but they are not specifically designed to protect conch. A recent study by the Bahamas National Trust identified areas that are important for conch reproduction and survival, and recommended that these areas be designated as conch sanctuaries.

Another potential solution is to regulate the size and timing of conch harvesting. The government has already taken some steps in this direction, by instituting a minimum size limit for harvested conch and a closed season from July to October. But some experts argue that the limits are not strict enough and that enforcement is lacking.

Education and awareness-raising are also crucial. Many Bahamians are unaware of the ecological importance of conch and the need to protect the species. By promoting sustainable fishing practices and educating the public on the importance of biodiversity conservation, the government and civil society can help shift attitudes and behaviors towards more responsible and sustainable practices.

Finally, the government can encourage alternative livelihoods for conch fishermen. Diversification into other areas of the seafood industry, such as lobster or conch farming, can provide income while reducing the pressure on wild conch populations.

The future of conch fishing in The Bahamas is at a crossroads. Unless measures are taken to protect the species and promote sustainable practices, the tradition and livelihood of conch fishing may not be sustainable in the long term. But with concerted efforts from all stakeholders, there is still hope for a future where conch is enjoyed as a delicacy and a symbol of Bahamian identity, while also ensuring its ecological and economic sustainability.",1
16,Small businesses weigh banking options amid bank turmoil,"As bank closures and consolidations continue to rock the financial industry, small business owners across the country are increasingly finding themselves in a difficult position when it comes to banking. With the fate of their go-to banks uncertain, many are forced to consider their options and weigh the pros and cons of switching to a new institution.

For some small business owners, the decision to switch banks is an easy one. ""When our bank announced its closure, we knew we had to find a new home for our accounts,"" says Josephine Smith, owner of a small manufacturing company in Kansas City, Missouri. ""We didn't want to risk having our accounts frozen or our funds tied up in the closure process.""

Other business owners, however, are more hesitant. Switching banks can be an expensive and time-consuming process, requiring the transfer of account information, the establishment of new lines of credit, and the potential loss of established relationships with bankers.

""Moving our accounts is daunting,"" admits Henry Lee, owner of a small retail shop in San Francisco. ""We're not sure how long it will take to get everything set up, and we're worried about any fees or penalties we might incur in the process.""

The situation is made even more complicated by the limited options available to small business owners. In many communities, small banks and credit unions are few and far between, leaving owners with little choice but to go with one of the big banks that dominate the industry.

""Switching banks is a hard decision to make,"" says Jamie Jones, owner of a small accounting firm in Chicago. ""Many of the major banks have a stranglehold on the market, and it can be hard to find a small bank or credit union that can meet our needs.""

Amid the turmoil in the banking industry, some small business owners are turning to alternative financial institutions for their banking needs. These institutions, which include online banks, community development financial institutions (CDFIs), and non-profit lenders, offer a range of financial services to small businesses, including checking and savings accounts, loans, and lines of credit.

""Small businesses are turning to us because we offer a more personalized, community-based approach to banking,"" says Maria Gonzalez, president of a CDFI in Houston. ""We have the flexibility to work with businesses that might not fit the mold of a traditional bank. We're able to offer creative solutions and build long-term partnerships with our customers.""

While switching to an alternative financial institution can be attractive for some small business owners, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of each option. Online banks, for example, offer convenience and often lower fees, but they may lack the personal touch and relationship-building opportunities of a traditional bank. CDFIs, on the other hand, may offer more personalized service and flexible lending options, but they may have stricter eligibility requirements and slower application processes.

For small business owners weighing their banking options, experts recommend doing research, comparing fees and rates, and talking to other business owners in their community. ""The more information you have, the better equipped you'll be to make a decision that's right for your business,"" says Michael Benson, a financial advisor in New York City.

Ultimately, the decision to switch banks comes down to a number of factors, including the size and needs of the business, its relationship with its current bank, and the availability of alternative options. While many small business owners are feeling the pinch of bank turmoil, it's important to remember that they have a range of options available to them, and that the right choice is out there if they take the time to find it.",1
17,China's exports rebound unexpectedly to growth in March,"China's exports unexpectedly rebounded to growth in March, signaling a recovery in the world's second-largest economy despite the ongoing global pandemic. The country's trade balance figures indicated that exports rose 30.6% in March from a year earlier, beating analysts' expectations. This growth is attributed to a higher demand for Chinese-made goods around the world as economies continue to recover from the pandemic.

China's overall trade surplus in March surged to a record $75.3 billion, up from $13.8 billion in the previous month. This was mainly due to a decline in imports, which dropped by 0.5% in March from a year earlier, reflecting subdued domestic demand.

Although the country's exports have risen for the fourth straight month, the overall trade surplus will likely draw criticism from the United States, which has long accused China of manipulating its currency and running a large trade surplus. These ongoing trade tensions between the two nations have disrupted the global supply chain and have hurt businesses around the world.

The unexpected surge in exports has also been attributed to China's effective containment of the pandemic within its borders, which has allowed the country's factories to resume production much earlier than other nations. The rollout of vaccines in other parts of the world has also increased consumer demand for electronics, medical equipment, and other goods made in China.

Many Chinese factories experienced a surge in orders from the US and Europe in March, which helped boost the country's export growth. This demand for Chinese exports is also driving up the prices of raw materials and contributing to rising inflation in many economies.

However, experts warn that the current surge in exports may not last long, as many countries are still grappling with the pandemic's economic fallout. The ongoing global supply chain disruptions, coupled with rising geopolitical tensions, could also hamper China's export growth in the coming months.

Despite these challenges, China's economy has rebounded faster than most, expanding by 18.3% in the first quarter of this year. This growth has been attributed to the country's effective handling of the pandemic and strong industrial output, which boosted demand for Chinese-made goods.

As the world economy continues to recover from the pandemic, China's export growth is likely to remain strong, bolstered by the country's competitive manufacturing sector and its position as a major exporter. However, ongoing trade tensions with the US and other countries, along with rising inflation and supply chain disruptions, could still pose challenges to China's export growth in the coming months.

The unexpected rebound in China's exports in March is a positive sign for the country's economy and the global economy at large. It indicates that the recovery from the pandemic is well underway, and that Chinese factories are once again operating at full capacity. However, the ongoing challenges of vaccine distribution, trade tensions, and supply chain disruptions continue to pose risks, reminding us that the path to recovery is still fraught with obstacles.",1

19,Hundreds rally against proposed large Idaho wind farm,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Hundreds of Idaho residents gathered at the State Capitol on Saturday to protest against a proposed large-scale wind farm project in their rural community.

The protesters, who came from the town of Fairfield and surrounding areas, expressed concerns about the impact of the wind turbines on the town's landscape and wildlife. They argued that if the project goes ahead, it would cause irreparable damage to the local ecosystem and harm the tourism industry, which relies on the natural beauty of the area.

""I grew up here, and I love this place. To see these ugly machines towering over our beautiful hills and valleys would be a tragedy,"" said Susan Johnson, a resident of Fairfield who organized the rally. ""We're not against renewable energy, but we're against destroying our community for the sake of it.""

The proposed wind farm, known as the Pioneer Wind Park, would feature over 100 wind turbines spread across 23,000 acres of private land in Camas County. The project is being developed by Global Power Generation, a subsidiary of Spanish electric utility company Naturgy.

The company has said that the project would generate up to 300 megawatts of clean energy and create jobs in the area. The wind farm is also expected to bring in revenue for landowners who lease their property to the company.

""We understand that there are concerns, and we take them seriously,"" said Juan Laso, head of development for Global Power Generation in the U.S. ""But we believe that this project can coexist with the community and benefit everyone in the long run.""

However, many residents are not convinced. They argue that the wind turbines would change the character of their town and harm the local economy.

""We have a lot of people who come here for hunting, fishing, camping, and just to get away from the city. They wouldn't come here if there were these giant turbines all over the place,"" said Maria Hernandez, a Fairfield resident who attended the rally.

The protesters are not alone in their fight. Several environmental groups, such as the Idaho Conservation League and the Sierra Club, have also voiced their opposition to the project. They argue that the wind turbines could harm local bird populations, including raptors such as eagles and hawks.

""The Pioneer Wind Park would be a disaster for wildlife in the area,"" said Justin Hayes, program director for the Idaho Conservation League. ""We need to prioritize conservation and protect our natural resources, instead of sacrificing them for short-term gain.""

Despite the opposition, the Pioneer Wind Park has received preliminary approval from the Idaho Public Utilities Commission. Global Power Generation is expected to apply for a final permit in the coming months. If approved, construction on the wind farm could begin as early as 2022.

The residents of Fairfield and their supporters are vowing to continue their fight against the Pioneer Wind Park. They say they're not against renewable energy, but they believe it's important to balance the benefits of clean energy with the need to protect the environment.

""We're not going to give up. This is our home, and we're going to fight to keep it the way it is,"" said Johnson. ""We hope the company will listen to us and work with us to find a better location for this project.""",1
20,"Inflation data, bank turmoil impact","The global economy is feeling the effects of inflation and bank turmoil, with financial markets showing signs of strain as central banks and governments work to manage the impact.

Inflation data from several major economies, including the United States, Eurozone, and China, has shown prices rising more quickly than anticipated. This has heightened concerns that central banks may need to raise interest rates sooner than expected to counteract rising inflation.

At the same time, several major banks have experienced significant setbacks. In Europe, the German-based lender Deutsche Bank announced a major restructuring plan that will see it cut over 18,000 jobs and exit its global equities business. This follows years of financial struggles for the bank, which has struggled to compete in global markets and faced numerous legal challenges.

Elsewhere, the Italian government has been forced to step in to save two major banks from collapse. Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banca Popolare di Vicenza both required significant government funding to stay afloat, highlighting ongoing challenges in the European banking sector.

In the US, banks have also been feeling the pressure. The Federal Reserve recently conducted stress tests of major US banks, and found that several would struggle to maintain adequate capital levels in the event of another financial crisis. This has raised concerns about the strength of the US banking system, particularly given recent efforts to deregulate the industry.

All of these developments have contributed to an increasingly uncertain economic environment, with investors grappling with the potential implications of rising inflation and ongoing banking turmoil.

Inflation is a particularly worrisome issue, as it can quickly erode the value of savings and investments. It can also make it more difficult for businesses to operate, as higher costs for raw materials or labor can eat into profit margins.

The Eurozone and China have both experienced surprising increases in inflation in recent months. In the Eurozone, inflation rose to 1.3% in June, up from 1.2% in May. This is still below the European Central Bank's target of 2%, but is higher than analysts had anticipated.

Meanwhile, China's consumer price index (CPI) rose to 2.7% in June, up from 2.4% the previous month. This is the highest level of inflation in nearly two years, and is being attributed to rising food prices and higher energy costs.

In the US, inflation has been less of a concern so far, with the CPI rising just 1.6% in June. However, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it is closely monitoring inflation data, and may need to raise interest rates if inflation continues to climb.

Higher interest rates could have major implications for investors, as they can make borrowing more expensive and slow economic growth. They could also cause stock prices to fall, as higher interest rates make bonds and other fixed-income investments more attractive relative to stocks.

Banking turmoil is another major issue contributing to economic uncertainty. Deutsche Bank's recent announcement that it will cut thousands of jobs and exit certain business lines is just the latest in a series of setbacks for the institution. Deutsche Bank has struggled for years to achieve sustainable profitability, and has faced numerous legal challenges over issues ranging from mortgage-backed securities to money laundering.

In Italy, the government has been forced to step in to rescue two major banks from collapse. Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Banca Popolare di Vicenza both required significant government funding to remain solvent, in a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by European banks.

In the US, several major banks have recently undergone stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve. The results indicate that some banks would struggle to maintain adequate capital levels in the event of another financial crisis. This has raised concerns about the strength of the US banking system, particularly given recent efforts to deregulate the industry.

All of these developments are contributing to a sense of unease among investors, who are trying to assess the potential risks and opportunities in the current economic environment. For some, rising inflation may signal the need to adjust investment strategies and diversify portfolios to include assets that can offset the impact of rising prices. For others, ongoing banking turmoil may create opportunities to invest in undervalued assets or seek out alternative financing options.

Ultimately, the impact of inflation and banking turmoil on the global economy remains uncertain. Central banks and governments will need to carefully monitor economic data and take steps to manage these challenges in order to promote long-term economic stability and growth. Investors will also need to remain vigilant and agile, with the ability to adapt to changing market conditions and identify emerging opportunities.",1
21,"Rays reach 12-0 to match best streak, close in on MLB record","The Tampa Bay Rays have been nothing short of dominant during the first month of the 2021 MLB season. With their win over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday, the Rays extended their winning streak to 12 games, matching the longest streak in franchise history. 

During this impressive stretch, the Rays have outscored their opponents 74-34 and have won games in a variety of ways. They've had dominant pitching performances, timely hitting from their stars, and contributions from unexpected sources on the roster. 

But even more impressive than matching their own franchise record is the fact that the Rays are now just five wins away from tying the MLB record for most consecutive victories, which is currently held by the 1916 New York Giants and the 1935 Chicago Cubs. 

Of course, it's still early in the season, and there's a long way to go before the Rays can even think about matching that record. But as of now, they're certainly playing like a team that's capable of making history. 

One of the keys to the Rays' success during this streak has been their pitching. They've allowed just 34 runs over the 12 games, which is an average of just 2.8 runs per game. Their starters have been especially impressive, posting a 2.38 ERA during the streak. 

Tyler Glasnow has been a standout in the rotation, going 3-0 with a 1.67 ERA over his last four starts. He's struck out 36 batters over 27 innings during that stretch, and has been one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball this season. 

But it's not just the starters who have been getting it done on the mound. The Rays' bullpen has been lights-out during the streak, allowing just five runs over 33 1/3 innings pitched. 

Diego Castillo has been the anchor of the bullpen, recording four saves and not allowing a run over his last six appearances. He's been joined by fellow relievers Andrew Kittredge, Jeffrey Springs, Pete Fairbanks, and Ryan Thompson, all of whom have held opponents scoreless during the winning streak. 

Of course, no team can win 12 games in a row without contributions from their offense. And the Rays have been getting timely hitting from some of their biggest stars. 

Brandon Lowe has been on fire, hitting .321 with three home runs and 10 RBIs during the winning streak. Austin Meadows has also been a major contributor, hitting .333 with three homers and nine RBIs over the 12 games. 

But what's been especially impressive about the Rays' offense during this streak is the fact that they've been getting contributions from unexpected sources. 

Yandy Diaz, who had just two hits all season entering the winning streak, has suddenly found his groove. He's hitting .286 with a home run and five RBIs over the 12 games. 

Mike Brosseau, who hit just .182 in April, has also stepped up during the streak. He's hitting .320 over the 12 games, and has driven in six runs. 

Both players are known for their ability to get on base and play solid defense, but their contributions with the bat have been crucial for the Rays during this run. 

Of course, winning 12 games in a row is no easy feat, especially in a league as competitive as the MLB. But the Rays are a team that's used to battling against the odds. 

They play in one of the toughest divisions in baseball, where they have to compete against the likes of the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, and Toronto Blue Jays. 

But the Rays have shown time and time again that they're a team that can play with anyone. They made it to the World Series last season, despite having one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. 

And they're doing it again this season, with a mix of young talent and savvy veterans who have bought into the team's philosophy of playing hard and playing smart. 

One of the biggest reasons for the Rays' success has been their depth. They have a deep roster with players who can fill multiple roles, and they're not afraid to mix and match based on the matchups each game. 

Manager Kevin Cash has been masterful in his handling of the team this season, making all the right moves with his bullpen and keeping his players focused during the winning streak. 

Of course, the road only gets tougher from here. The Rays have a series against the Houston Astros coming up, followed by matchups against the Los Angeles Angels and the New York Mets. 

But if the first month of the season is any indication, the Rays are up for the challenges that lie ahead. They're a team that's playing with confidence and swagger, and they're not satisfied with just matching their franchise record for consecutive wins. 

They want to make history. And if they keep playing the way they have been, they just might do it.",1
22,"US, Ukraine say many war secrets safe from intel leaks","WASHINGTON (AP) — American and Ukrainian intelligence officials have indicated that many vital war secrets remain secure despite recent leaks of sensitive information by both nations. However, the officials have warned that terrorists and enemy nations could use the leaked information to develop strategies to attack U.S. interests.

The U.S. National Security Agency, which has been embroiled in scandals for years, was recently hit by a massive breach of top-secret files that revealed its surveillance of U.S. citizens and foreign governments. The breach has risks of exposing some key secrets about the nation's operations overseas.

Officials in the two countries say they were relieved to discover that the breach did not include sensitive military operations data, but they remain concerned that terrorists could use the information to plan their next move.

Ukrainian officials say that the country's military and intelligence agencies have also been hit by data breaches. But they state that the damage was limited to inside information on covert operations and plans for a massive military offensive against the rebels in eastern regions of Ukraine.

U.S. officials praised their Ukrainian counterparts for their role in safeguarding American secrets that were shared with the Ukrainians over the years. This includes their assistance in the decades-long operations against the Russian intelligence service known as the GRU.

""We have shared information with our Ukrainian partners for many years and are confident that they have taken adequate measures to protect those secrets,"" said a senior U.S. intelligence official who requested anonymity.

The joint statement by the U.S. and Ukrainian officials is a rare public acknowledgement of the cooperation between the two countries in both people and information sharing. It also underscores the importance of the shared interests of the allies as Ukraine continues to battle with separatist insurgents backed by Russia.

Ukraine remains a vital partner for the U.S. in the fight against terrorism and Russian aggression. The country has been able to fend off several significant threats by the Russians, including the invasion of the Crimean peninsula in 2014.

Despite these successes, Ukraine has struggled to contain the separatist insurgency in its eastern regions, where the Russian-backed fighters have taken control of large swathes of territory.

The U.S. has committed to providing Ukraine with military and intelligence support to help them fight against the insurgents. But the officials warn that this support must come with caution.

""We need to be careful not to share too much information with our Ukrainian partners when it could expose our own vulnerabilities,"" said another senior U.S. intelligence official, also requesting anonymity.

The concern around the security of the shared information comes as Ukraine continues to experience cyber attacks and data breaches by Russian hackers. The Ukrainian government has been on high alert since June 2021, when the country's websites and banking services were temporarily paralyzed as a result of a massive cyber attack.

The situation has also been exacerbated by recent tensions between Ukraine and Belarus, where Belarusian authorities arrested a Ukrainian human rights activist, accusing her of planning a terrorist attack. Ukraine denies the allegations and has declared that the arrested woman is a political prisoner.

The officials said that the increased tensions in the region had heightened the need for intelligence cooperation, but the same tensions had also increased the risk of sensitive information being leaked.

Despite the challenges, the U.S. and Ukraine appear to be moving forward with their cooperation, with the two countries recently signing a new intelligence-sharing agreement.

""Our cooperation is critical to helping us address the complex security challenges we face today,"" said a spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council.

The officials in both countries urge that the information sharing is essential to the success of their military operations and that they will continue to cooperate and adapt to the evolving threat environment.

""We will do what it takes to safeguard our people, our interests, and our secrets,"" the officials said in a statement.

The statement comes as the U.S. and Ukrainian officials prepare to potentially participate in a new round of talks with Russia, which aims to put an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

The officials hope that the talks will lead to a peaceful and democratic resolution, but acknowledge that the threat of Russian aggression will remain. The intelligence sharing partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to play a significant role in the success of any future military operations.

Overall, American and Ukrainian intelligence agencies claim they have a secure grip on their war secrets, but with the threat of cyber-attacks from Russia and other enemies remaining a major threat, this latest agreement highlights the value of partnerships in intelligence sharing. Time will ultimately tell how effective the latest partnership has been in keeping enemies at bay.",1
23,25 Europe-bound migrants dead in boat sinking off Tunisia,"At least 25 migrants who were attempting to reach Europe from Libya have died after their boat capsized off the coast of Tunisia on Tuesday. The boat was carrying some 60 people, including women and children, when it sank near the Tunisian port city of Sfax.

The Tunisian Red Crescent confirmed that 25 bodies had been recovered so far, including those of three children, but the search for survivors continues. The cause of the accident is not yet known.

Tunisian authorities said that the vessel was carrying migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Egypt, and Bangladesh, and that many of them had been living in Libya for some time.

The North African country has become a major departure point for migrants seeking to reach Europe, with many boarding dangerous and overcrowded boats to cross the Mediterranean Sea. More than 1,000 migrants have died in the Mediterranean this year alone, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

Tunisian authorities have expressed concern about the increase in illegal migration since the outbreak of violence in Libya in 2011, and have stepped up patrols along the coast. However, limited resources and lack of cooperation from human traffickers have made it difficult to curb the dangerous and illegal crossings.",1
24,Romney gets 1st likely challenger in '24 Utah Senate primary,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Senator Mitt Romney, who made headlines in recent weeks for his criticism of former President Donald Trump, has received his first likely challenger in the 2024 Utah Senate primary.

Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, a Republican who was first elected to the position in 2013, is reportedly considering a run for the seat currently held by Romney.

Reyes, a staunch supporter of Trump, has faced criticism in the past for his ties to the former president and his handling of high-profile cases. Despite this, he remains popular among Utah Republicans and could pose a serious challenge to Romney’s bid for re-election.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Reyes did not confirm whether he would be running for the seat, but said he was “very interested” in the race and had been approached by “a lot of different people” about running.

“I have a lot of support among the grassroots and among the party establishment,” Reyes said. “I believe I have a message that resonates with Utah voters, and if I decide to run, I’m confident I could win.”

If Reyes does decide to run, he could have a strong advantage going into the primary. The attorney general is well-known among Utah voters, and his record on conservative issues aligns closely with the beliefs of the state’s Republican base.

However, Reyes could face significant challenges in his bid for the Senate seat. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has a strong base of support in Utah and remains popular among both Democrats and moderate Republicans.

In addition, Romney’s recent vocal criticism of Trump has earned him praise from many Utah voters who were disappointed with the former president’s conduct and policies during his time in office.

The senator was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial, a decision that drew both criticism and admiration from different factions of the party.

Romney’s willingness to break with the Trump administration on issues like impeachment and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has made him a high-profile figure in the Senate and could make him a formidable opponent in 2024.

Reyes, however, believes that his own record on issues like law and order, national security, and economic growth could resonate with Utah voters and help him win the primary.

“I’ve been a strong advocate for conservative values throughout my career, and I believe those values are still important to Utah voters,” Reyes said. “I’ll be making my case to the people of Utah in the coming months, and I’m confident that they’ll see that I’m the best candidate to represent them in Washington.”

The stakes in the 2024 Utah Senate race are high, as the outcome could have significant implications for the future of the Republican Party and the country as a whole.

If Romney wins re-election, he could continue his role as a prominent voice for moderation and bipartisanship in the Senate, working to bridge the divide between Republicans and Democrats on a range of issues.

On the other hand, Reyes — or any other challenger who may emerge in the coming years — could represent a more conservative, Trump-centric vision for the party, pushing for policies that align more closely with the former president’s agenda.

The outcome of the race could also have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election, as Utah is a key swing state and could play a critical role in determining the next occupant of the White House.

For now, Reyes is focused on weighing his options and deciding whether to launch a bid for the Senate seat. He says he hasn’t yet made a final decision, but expects to do so in the coming months.

“I’m taking this very seriously,” Reyes said. “It’s a big decision, and I want to make sure I’m doing the right thing for Utah and for my party.”

If Reyes does decide to run, he could face a difficult and divisive primary battle against Romney, who remains a powerful and influential figure in Utah politics. But the attorney general says he’s up to the challenge.

“I know it won’t be easy, but I believe I have what it takes to win,” Reyes said. “I’ll be working hard to make my case to the people of Utah, and I’m confident that they’ll see that I’m the best candidate for the job.”",1
25,Wall Street rallies and tech stocks leap as inflation cools,"Wall Street rallies and tech stocks leap as inflation cools

New York, NY - The stock market experienced a significant rally on Wednesday, with major indices turning green as investors cheered the news of falling inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 267 points, or 0.8%, to close at 33,946.12. Meanwhile, both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw gains of 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively.

Investors were buoyed by the latest inflation data, which showed that price pressures had cooled in May. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the cost of goods and services, rose by 0.6% last month, a slower pace than the 0.8% increase seen in April. On an annual basis, CPI has risen by 5%, a level that is higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, but the slowdown in the monthly increase was seen as an encouraging sign by Wall Street.

""The inflation numbers were not as bad as some had feared,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial. ""That's why we're seeing this kind of relief rally.""

Tech stocks were the biggest beneficiaries of the market's upward momentum, with names like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all posting strong gains. The NYSE FANG+ Index, which tracks some of the largest and most powerful tech companies in the world, surged by 4.1% on Wednesday.

The rally in tech stocks was particularly significant given the recent volatility in the sector. In the past few weeks, investors had been concerned that high-growth tech names were overvalued and due for a correction. However, the newfound optimism on Wall Street suggests that investors may be more confident about the future prospects of these companies.

""The tech giants have been on a rollercoaster ride recently, with investors questioning whether they have peaked and whether their valuations are justified,"" said Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X ETFs. ""However, today's rally suggests that investors are feeling good about the sector again.""

Other sectors that saw notable gains included consumer discretionary and communication services. Financials, however, lagged behind the broader market, with the sector posting a modest loss of 0.2%. This was due in part to falling bond yields, which put pressure on bank stocks.

The bond market has been closely watched by investors in recent months, as rising yields have been seen as a signal of increasing inflationary pressures. However, on Wednesday, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.49%, down from 1.56% only a day earlier. This move was interpreted by some analysts as a sign that investors no longer see inflation as a major threat.

""Investors had gotten pretty nervous about the bond market over the past few weeks, but today's move is reassuring,"" said Detrick. ""It suggests that the bond market is no longer pricing in runaway inflation.""

Despite the strong gains seen in the stock market on Wednesday, some analysts remain cautious about the outlook for the rest of the year. Lingering COVID-related risks, rising commodity prices and geopolitical tensions are just some of the factors that could derail the market's upward trajectory.

""Investors should be cautiously optimistic,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ""While the falling inflation numbers are encouraging, there are still a lot of uncertainties in the market. We're not out of the woods yet.""

Indeed, market volatility is likely to continue as investors weigh the impact of a range of economic and geopolitical factors. The ongoing global semiconductor shortage, for example, could pose a risk to tech stocks, while tensions between the US and China could impact the broader market.

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's policy stance remains a key unknown for investors. While the central bank has signaled its intention to keep interest rates low for the foreseeable future, there is uncertainty over when and how it will begin to taper its bond-buying program.

""As we move into the second half of the year, we're likely to see more volatility in the market,"" said Detrick. ""Investors should be prepared for some bumps in the road.""

Despite the uncertainties, however, Wednesday's market rally was undoubtedly welcome news for investors, who have had a bumpy ride since the start of the year. And with the latest inflation data showing signs of cooling, many on Wall Street will be hoping that this upward momentum can be sustained in the months ahead.",1
26,2 children killed in latest NYC e-bike fire; 4 survive blaze,"NEW YORK (AP) — Two children were killed and four people survived a blaze caused by an e-bike battery in New York City's Bronx borough on Sunday, police said.

According to the authorities, the e-bike battery caught fire in the family’s apartment, located on the third floor of a six-story building in the Bronx. The fire quickly spread, engulfing the entire apartment. Two children were killed in the blaze, and their parents and two siblings were injured but managed to escape the fire.

The victims have been identified as Jackson Nunez, 3, and his 1-year-old sister, Sincere. The parents, Juan and Carmen Nunez, and their two other children were taken to Jacobi Medical Center where they are being treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

The cause of the fire was determined to be a faulty e-bike battery, which sparked and ignited nearby combustible materials. The e-bike batteries, which are becoming increasingly popular among New Yorkers as a cheaper and more environmentally friendly mode of transportation, have been involved in several fires in recent months.

In response to the tragedy, the New York City Fire Department has issued a warning to residents about the potential hazards of e-bike batteries. In a statement released Sunday, the department urged New Yorkers to be cautious when using and storing e-bikes, and to ensure that the batteries were properly charged and not damaged.

“This tragic incident is a reminder of just how dangerous these batteries can be if they are not used and stored properly,” said Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro. “We urge all New Yorkers to exercise caution when using e-bikes, and to make sure that their batteries are well-maintained and stored in a safe place.”

The incident has also raised concerns about the safety of e-bikes and their batteries. In recent months, several cities, including New York, have seen a surge in the use of e-bikes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as people look for safer and more socially distanced modes of transportation.

However, safety experts have warned that the batteries used in e-bikes can be highly volatile if not handled properly. Many e-bike batteries are made in China, where there have been reports of explosions and fires caused by faulty batteries, prompting the Chinese government to tighten safety regulations.

Meanwhile, in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to increase safety regulations around e-bikes and to crack down on illegal e-bike use. However, critics say more needs to be done to protect the public from the potential hazards posed by these increasingly popular vehicles.",1

28,"In ‘Mafia Mamma,’ murder by stilettos and by cliche","In ‘Mafia Mamma,’ murder by stilettos and by cliche

‘Mafia Mamma’ is a new Italian TV series that premiered earlier this week, and it seems to be taking viewers back in time to another era of television. The show fits neatly into the mold of the gloriously cheesy crime dramas of the 1980s and 90s, with over-the-top acting, predictable plot twists, and gratuitous use of slow motion.

The series, which follows the adventures of a widow who becomes the head of her family’s criminal empire, stars veteran Italian actress Serena Autieri as the titular character, Maria. Maria’s husband, a powerful mob boss, is gunned down in the first episode, setting off a chain of events that leads her to take charge of the family business.

At its heart, ‘Mafia Mamma’ is a classic fish-out-of-water story. Maria, a sweet and innocent housewife, is suddenly thrust into a world of violence and intrigue, where she must navigate the treacherous waters of organized crime. Her enemies are many, but the show seems to delight in piling on the cliches, from double-crossing associates to crooked cops.

The show’s best moments come when it leans into its absurdity. One episode sees Maria dispatching a foe with a pair of stilettos, while another involves a high-speed car chase through the streets of Naples. But these moments of pure, popcorn entertainment are all too rare, and are often bogged down by the show’s melodrama and heavy-handed exposition.

And then there’s the acting. While Autieri is clearly having fun in the lead role, many of her co-stars seem to be phoning it in. There’s a certain hamminess to the performances, a knowing wink to the audience that suggests the cast is in on the joke. But this self-awareness only goes so far, and the show’s attempts at authenticity often fall flat.

Ultimately, ‘Mafia Mamma’ is a fun but forgettable romp through a well-worn genre. It’s the kind of show you watch when you’re in the mood for something mindless and silly, something you can tune out for a while and then come back to without missing a beat. But it’s not a show that will keep you coming back week after week, eager to see what crazy antics Maria and her crew get up to next.

The series is not without its strengths, however. For one thing, it’s refreshing to see a female lead in a genre that is often dominated by men. Maria may be a reluctant criminal mastermind, but she’s also a loving mother and grandmother, and her relationships with her family members are some of the show’s more compelling moments.

And while the series may be formulaic, it does succeed in capturing the look and feel of classic Italian cinema. The cinematography is lush and evocative, and the show’s soundtrack, filled with sweeping strings and accordion solos, perfectly captures the mood of a bygone era.

Overall, ‘Mafia Mamma’ is a mixed bag. It’s not quite self-aware enough to be a true parody, nor is it earnest enough to be taken seriously. But for fans of over-the-top crime dramas, it’s worth a shot. Just don’t expect anything too groundbreaking.

In today's age where viewers demand more nuanced storytelling and complex characters, 'Mafia Mamma' seems to fall short in keeping pace. The show reeks of outdated tropes of girls-next-door turned drug lords, and while there might be an audience for that kind of entertainment, it is becoming increasingly smaller.

In conclusion, while 'Mafia Mamma' delivers on entertainment, it falls short on storytelling and character development. Viewers might find it worth a watch for the nostalgia and fun, but don't expect a groundbreaking show.",1
29,Judge temporarily blocks clean water rule in 24 states,"A federal judge has temporarily blocked a clean water rule in 24 states, which would have drastically expanded the U.S. government's authority to regulate pollution in wetlands, streams, and other bodies of water. 

Judge Lisa Godbey Wood, who was appointed by former president George W. Bush, granted an injunction to several states that had sued to stop the rule, arguing that it exceeded the authority of the Clean Water Act and was an example of federal overreach. 

The rule, which was finalized in 2015 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers under former president Barack Obama, extended protections to small streams and tributaries that flow into larger bodies of water, as well as wetlands that are adjacent to those bodies of water. It was meant to clarify which waters fell under federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act, which was passed in 1972 to regulate pollution in U.S. waters. 

However, the rule was immediately met with opposition from some farmers, developers, and landowners, who argued that it would harm property rights and lead to unnecessary regulation. The rule was also challenged in court by a coalition of states led by North Dakota, which argued that it would expand federal power beyond what Congress intended in the Clean Water Act. 

In her injunction, Judge Wood said that the states had shown that they were likely to succeed in their lawsuit against the rule, and that they faced irreparable harm if the rule was allowed to go into effect. She also said that the EPA and the Army Corps had likely exceeded their authority in drafting the rule, and that the rule was ""arbitrary and capricious."" 

The states that sued to block the rule were Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming, as well as eight other states that had joined the lawsuit. The rule remains in effect in the other 26 states, as well as in Washington, D.C. 

Environmental groups decried the injunction, saying that it would leave millions of acres of wetlands and small streams vulnerable to pollution and destruction. ""This is a reckless decision that puts the drinking water of millions of Americans at risk,"" said Jon Devine, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Polluters and their allies will exploit this ruling to further undermine essential protections for our waters."" 

The EPA and the Army Corps, which are now under control of the Trump administration, had previously proposed repealing the clean water rule and replacing it with a narrower definition of ""waters of the United States."" According to the EPA, the rule was costly and confusing for landowners and had led to uncertainty about what waters were subject to regulation. 

The Trump administration's proposed replacement rule, which is still being reviewed, would remove protections for certain types of water bodies that were covered under the Obama rule. Environmental groups have criticized the proposal, saying that it would endanger the health and safety of U.S. waters and undermine the Clean Water Act. 

The legal battle over the clean water rule is likely to continue for months or even years, as the states that sued to block the rule continue to press their case in court. This latest development is a blow to supporters of the Obama-era rule, who had hoped to see it enforced nationwide. 

As the debate over the proper scope of federal regulation of U.S. waters continues, the importance of clean water for public health, wildlife habitat, and the economy remains a critical issue.

Wholesale inflation in the United States rose at its fastest pace in almost 41 years in October, as the economy continued to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. While this news may be concerning for some, it has helped to fuel a rally on Wall Street that has seen the major indexes hit new highs.

According to the Labor Department, the producer price index (PPI) rose by 8.6% last month, the biggest year-on-year gain since November 1980. This followed an increase of 8.5% in September.

Prices for goods increased by 9.6% last month, while prices for services rose by 6.8%. The increase in prices was driven by rises in energy prices, as well as higher costs for transportation and warehousing.

The rise in wholesale inflation comes at a time when the U.S. economy is rebounding from the pandemic. The labor market has been steadily improving, and consumer spending has remained strong, leading to an increase in demand for goods and services.

However, the rise in prices has raised concerns about inflation, and what it means for the economy. Higher prices for goods and services can lead to reduced purchasing power for consumers, which can lead to lower economic growth.

There are also concerns that higher inflation could lead to higher interest rates, which can make borrowing more expensive, and slow down economic activity.

The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero since the pandemic began, and has signaled that it does not plan to raise rates until at least 2023. However, if inflation continues to rise, the Fed may be forced to reconsider its stance.

Despite these concerns, the rise in wholesale inflation has helped to fuel a rally on Wall Street that has seen the major indexes hit new highs.

On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new record high of 36,250.09, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also climbed to new highs.

Investors have been encouraged by the strong economic data, as well as the ongoing rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, which has helped to boost confidence in the economy.

The rise in wholesale inflation has also boosted the shares of energy companies, which have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the rise in energy prices.

However, there are concerns that the rally on Wall Street may be unsustainable, and that investors may be overlooking some of the risks facing the economy.

For example, there are concerns that the ongoing supply chain disruptions could lead to further price increases, which could put a damper on economic growth.

There are also concerns about the ongoing labor shortages, which have led to increased wages for workers, but have also led to higher costs for businesses.

Some analysts have also noted that the rise in wholesale inflation may not necessarily translate into higher consumer prices, as businesses may be reluctant to pass on higher costs to consumers.

Despite these risks, many investors remain bullish on the economy, and believe that the rally on Wall Street will continue.

However, there are some who are urging caution, and warning that the current economic environment is still uncertain.

In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs warned that investors should be prepared for a period of heightened volatility, as the economy navigates through the ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.

The investment bank also noted that investors should be cautious when investing in stocks, and should focus on companies that are well-positioned to weather the current economic environment.

Overall, the rise in wholesale inflation has raised concerns about the economy, but has also helped to fuel a rally on Wall Street.

While investors remain bullish on the economy, there are concerns about the ongoing supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which could put a damper on economic growth.

Despite these risks, many investors believe that the rally on Wall Street will continue, and that the economy will continue to recover from the pandemic in the coming months.",1
31,"Missouri to limit gender-affirming care for minors, adults","In a move that has drawn criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates and medical professionals, the Missouri state legislature has passed a bill that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors and adults.

The bill, which was signed into law by Governor Mike Parson on June 30th, prohibits medical professionals from prescribing hormone therapy or performing gender confirmation surgery on anyone under the age of 18. The law also requires parents and legal guardians to sign written consent forms acknowledging the potential risks of such treatments for minors.

For adults, the law requires a medical professional to provide a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and obtain written consent from the patient before prescribing hormone therapy or performing surgery.

Opponents of the bill argue that it puts the health and well-being of transgender individuals at risk by denying them the care that they need.

""This is an attack on the transgender community,"" said Steph Perkins, CEO of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group PROMO. ""Transgender kids and adults need access to gender-affirming care to live healthy, authentic lives.""

Medical professionals also expressed concern about the bill's impact on their ability to provide appropriate care to their patients.

""Gender-affirming care is essential for the health and well-being of transgender individuals,"" said Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a pediatrician at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. ""Denying them access to this care puts them at risk for mental and physical harm.""

Gender dysphoria is a medical condition in which a person experiences distress or discomfort as a result of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity. The American Medical Association and other medical organizations recognize gender-affirming care, including hormone therapy and surgery, as effective treatment for gender dysphoria.

According to the Human Rights Campaign, at least 19 other states have introduced bills this year that would limit access to gender-affirming care for minors. Arkansas passed a similar law in March, but it was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in July.

Advocates and medical professionals in Missouri are now calling on Governor Parson to veto the bill, citing the harm that it could cause to transgender individuals.

""We are urging Governor Parson to do the right thing and veto this harmful legislation,"" said Perkins. ""We cannot let transgender individuals in Missouri be denied the care that they need and deserve.""

However, supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary to protect minors from the potential risks and long-term consequences of gender-affirming care.

""The decision to pursue gender transition is a major, life-altering choice,"" said Republican state representative Suzie Pollock in a statement. ""It should not be taken lightly or without the appropriate safeguards in place to protect our vulnerable youth.""

Some opponents of the bill also argue that it violates the rights of transgender individuals to make decisions about their own bodies.

""This bill is a gross violation of the rights of transgender individuals,"" said Lambda Legal Senior Attorney and Health Care Strategist Omar Gonzalez-Pagan in a statement. ""It is a blatant attempt to deny them the ability to make decisions about their own health care and their own lives.""

The passage of the bill in Missouri is part of a growing trend of legislation targeting transgender rights across the United States. In addition to the bills proposed in several other states, Republican lawmakers in Congress have also introduced bills that would limit access to gender-affirming care for minors in all states.

Opponents of these bills argue that they are discriminatory and put transgender individuals at risk for harm.

""Transgender people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and to have access to the care that they need to live their best lives,"" said Perkins. ""We will continue to fight for their rights and work to ensure that they are protected from harmful legislation like this.""

It remains to be seen whether Governor Parson will veto the bill, but for now, transgender individuals in Missouri are left with uncertainty about their access to critical medical care.

""Transgender Missourians are facing a devastating blow to their health care,"" said Perkins. ""We will not stop fighting until they have the same access to health care as everyone else.""",1
32,States and companies compete for billions to make hydrogen,"As governments and industries around the world look for greener solutions to power their economies, hydrogen is emerging as a promising alternative. The gas can be produced from renewable resources like wind and solar power and can be used in various sectors from energy production to transport. But as the demand for hydrogen grows, states and companies are battling to secure a share of the billions of dollars being funneled into its production.

Several countries, including Japan, Germany, and South Korea, have already committed to ambitious hydrogen strategies. The European Union has also set out plans to increase its hydrogen production capacity to 40GW by 2030, up from around 1GW today. The US, which reversed its stance on the Paris Climate Agreement under President Joe Biden, is also making strides in promoting the use of hydrogen.

Earlier this year, the US Department of Energy announced the launch of its Energy Earthshots Initiative, which includes a target of cutting the cost of producing clean hydrogen by 80% by 2030. The initiative also aims to reduce the cost of long-duration energy storage by 90%, paving the way for more renewables to be integrated into the grid.

The US government has also earmarked $100 million for research into hydrogen safety and infrastructure, as well as $160 million for carbon capture projects that could be used in conjunction with hydrogen production.

At the state level, California has become a hotbed for hydrogen investment. The state's governor, Gavin Newsom, has set the ambitious target of having five million zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) on the road by 2030. To achieve this, California is investing $1.5 billion in statewide infrastructure, including hydrogen refueling stations.

""The state has been doing really aggressive work over the last five years in terms of building out hydrogen infrastructure,"" said Bill Elrick, executive director of the California Fuel Cell Partnership. ""We have 44 stations operational, and we're targeting 200 stations by 2025.""

California's leadership in this space has attracted the attention of some of the world's largest car manufacturers, including Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai, which have all invested in building vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

Toyota, which has been producing its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell car since 2014, plans to expand its production capacity to 30,000 vehicles per year by 2025. The company has also partnered with Shell to establish seven new hydrogen refueling stations in California.

Other companies are also vying for a slice of the hydrogen pie. Australian mining giant BHP Group announced in May that it plans to invest $335 million in producing low-emissions hydrogen to power its operations, while German power company RWE has committed $227 million to build a 100MW electrolyzer plant in Lingen, Germany.

But as more players enter the market, there are growing concerns about the sustainability of hydrogen production. While the gas can be produced from renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, the process is still reliant on fossil fuels in most cases.

The most commonly used method for producing hydrogen today is steam methane reforming, which produces hydrogen by reacting natural gas with high-temperature steam. This process emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, making it far from a clean solution.

As a result, many governments and companies are looking to alternative methods of hydrogen production. One method gaining traction is electrolysis, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. When powered by renewable energy sources, this method can produce completely emissions-free hydrogen.

""We're seeing a lot of interest in green hydrogen, which refers to hydrogen that is produced using renewable energy,"" said Elrick. ""It's definitely something that's becoming more important.""

In Europe, some countries are already pushing ahead with green hydrogen production. Last month, Portugal unveiled plans to build a green hydrogen plant powered by a solar park and wind turbine farm, with a capacity of 1GW. Meanwhile, Denmark's government has set out plans to produce green hydrogen at scale, with a target of 5GW production capacity by 2030.

The market for hydrogen is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, with some analysts predicting that it could become a trillion-dollar industry by 2050. And with governments around the world committing to ambitious targets for reducing emissions, it's likely that competition for funding and investment in hydrogen will only intensify.

As states and companies compete to secure their share of the hydrogen market, the focus will increasingly shift towards ensuring that production methods are sustainable and emissions-free. With the right infrastructure and investment, hydrogen could play a major role in powering the low-carbon economies of the future.",1
33,Death penalty looms over Pittsburgh synagogue massacre trial,"The court trial for the horrific mass shooting at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue in October 2018 is set to begin, and with it comes the question of whether the perpetrator will face the death penalty.

Robert Bowers, 46, stands accused of entering the synagogue on the morning of October 27, 2018, armed with an assault-style rifle and three handguns, and opening fire on congregants during a Shabbat service. Eleven people were killed, and several others were injured, including four police officers.

The attack was condemned widely as an act of hate and anti-Semitism, and it has been labeled the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history. Bowers was indicted on 44 federal counts, including hate crimes and firearms offenses, and has pleaded not guilty.

The trial is set to begin on September 14, and arguments about the death penalty are expected to be a significant part of the proceedings.

Prosecutors have indicated that they intend to seek the death penalty if Bowers is found guilty. They argue that the severity of the crime, combined with Bowers' lack of remorse and the fact that he acted with premeditation, makes him eligible for the ultimate punishment.

Bowers' defense team has argued against the death penalty, citing their client's history of mental illness and abusive childhood. They have also suggested that the death penalty is unconstitutional, citing concerns about its disproportionate use against people of color, poor defendants, and those with intellectual disabilities.

The debate over the death penalty in this case is complicated, and it reflects broader questions about the use of capital punishment in the United States. Supporters of the death penalty argue that it serves as a powerful deterrent against heinous crimes and provides justice for victims and their families. Opponents of the death penalty argue that it is an inherently flawed system that risks executing innocent people, perpetuates racial inequalities, and is ultimately ineffective in deterring crime.

The decision about whether to seek the death penalty in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre trial ultimately rests with Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland has said that he personally opposes the death penalty, but he has also indicated that he believes it is a decision that must be made on a case-by-case basis.

The use of the death penalty in the United States has declined sharply in recent years. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 17 states and the District of Columbia have abolished the death penalty, and several other states have either imposed a moratorium on executions or are considering doing so.

The use of the death penalty has also been declining due to changing public attitudes. A 2021 Gallup poll found that support for the death penalty had fallen to its lowest point in almost 50 years, with only 55% of Americans supporting it. That marks a significant drop from 1994, when 80% of Americans supported the death penalty.

As the debate over the use of the death penalty continues, the trial of Robert Bowers and its possible outcome will draw intense scrutiny. The families of the victims have expressed a wide range of opinions about the death penalty in this case.

Some family members have come out publicly in favor of the death penalty, arguing that Bowers deserves the harshest possible punishment for his actions. Others have opposed the death penalty, citing religious and moral reasons.

Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life Synagogue has been a vocal opponent of the death penalty, and he has been working with the group of family members who share his views.

""I have a personal and deep-seated opposition to the death penalty for a variety of reasons,"" Myers said. ""From the standpoint of Jewish tradition, we believe that every human being is created in the image of God and therefore deserves dignity and respect, even if they have done something terribly wrong.""

Myers also argued that the death penalty is expensive, racially biased, and does not serve as an effective deterrent. He and other opponents of the death penalty are calling for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for Bowers.

Supporters of the death penalty argue that it is necessary in cases like this one, where the crime is so heinous and the perpetrator has shown no remorse. They say that Bowers' actions were a direct attack on the Jewish community, and that justice demands a strong response.

""The death penalty is appropriate in this case because it sends a message to people who might be contemplating similar attacks,"" said Rabbi Aaron Bisno of Rodef Shalom Congregation in Pittsburgh. ""It says that if you commit these kinds of crimes, you will face the highest possible consequences.""

The trial of Robert Bowers is likely to be emotional and contentious, with both the prosecution and the defense fighting hard for their respective views. Ultimately, the decision about what sentence to impose will fall to a judge, who will hear arguments from both sides and consider the evidence presented at trial.

Whatever the outcome, this trial is sure to be closely watched and to raise important questions about the use of the death penalty in American criminal justice. It will also be a time of reflection for the families of the victims as they confront the legacy of this tragedy and seek a measure of closure and justice for their loved ones.",1
34,Gun shop faces fine for selling high-capacity ammo magazines,"In a recent development that renewed the gun control debate, a Central Florida gun shop has been fined over $100,000 for selling high-capacity ammunition magazines.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued the fine to Tactical Supply after an investigation found that the gun shop had sold more than 1,000 high-capacity magazines to a customer over a three-year period. High-capacity magazines, which can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, have been at the center of the gun control debate in the United States for years, with advocates arguing that they should be banned to limit mass shootings.

According to the ATF, Tactical Supply's sales of high-capacity magazines were in violation of federal law, which prohibits the sale, manufacture, and importation of such magazines since 1994. The law was allowed to expire in 2004, but some states, including California and New York, have enacted their own bans on high-capacity magazines.

Tactical Supply's owner, Brandon McCreery, has contested the ATF's findings, arguing that the high-capacity magazines were not illegal under Florida law at the time of the sales. However, the ATF has argued that federal law supersedes state laws in regulating firearms and ammunition sales.

The fine, which amounts to $105,000, will be levied against Tactical Supply over a three-year period. The gun shop will also be required to surrender all the high-capacity magazines that it still has in stock.

The case has once again highlighted the contentious issue of gun control in the United States, with many advocates calling for a renewed ban on high-capacity magazines. A study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that mass shootings with high-capacity magazines resulted in higher numbers of deaths, injuries, and shots fired than those without such magazines.

Opponents of gun control, however, argue that such bans infringe on Second Amendment rights, which protect the right to bear arms. They also argue that criminals will still be able to acquire illegal firearms and ammunition regardless of any new gun control laws.

The issue of gun control has taken on renewed urgency in recent years, with a record number of mass shootings in the United States. In 2019, there were 417 mass shootings in the country, resulting in 465 deaths and 1,707 injuries, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

The debate over gun control is likely to continue in the coming years, particularly in the lead-up to the 2020 U.S. Presidential election. Many Democratic candidates for the presidency have endorsed stricter gun control measures, such as universal background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.",1
35,Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog won't play in playoffs,"DENVER (AP) — The Colorado Avalanche will be without their captain Gabriel Landeskog as they prepare to face off against the Vegas Golden Knights in the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

The Avalanche released a statement on Tuesday, addressing Landeskog's absence from the team.

""Gabe Landeskog will not be available for the remainder of the playoffs due to COVID-19 protocols,"" the statement read.

The announcement comes at a difficult time for the team. Landeskog, who has been with the Avalanche since 2011, has been a major contributor to their recent success. In the first round of the playoffs against the St. Louis Blues, Landeskog scored three goals and tallied five assists in six games.

Despite the setback, Avalanche head coach Jared Bednar said he is confident in his team's ability to move forward without their captain.

""It's obviously a tough blow for our team,"" Bednar said in a press conference on Tuesday. ""We'll miss Gabe's leadership, his energy, and his production on the ice. But we have a deep roster, and we're prepared to step up and fill the void.""

Landeskog's absence could create an opportunity for other players on the team to step up and make an impact. Players like Mikko Rantanen, Nathan MacKinnon, and Andre Burakovsky will be counted on to provide offense for the Avalanche in Landeskog's absence.

""We're going to have to play hard and play smart,"" Rantanen said in a statement. ""Gabe is a huge part of our team, but we have confidence in everyone in the locker room. We're going to come together and do everything we can to win.""

The Avalanche finished the regular season with a league-best record of 39-13-4. They swept the Blues in the first round to advance to the second round of the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Golden Knights defeated the Minnesota Wild in seven games to advance.

Despite the absence of their captain, the Avalanche remain one of the top teams in the NHL. They will be a formidable opponent for the Golden Knights, who finished the regular season with a record of 40-14-2.

The second-round series between the Avalanche and Golden Knights is set to begin on Sunday, June 6. The winner will advance to the Western Conference Finals.

The loss of Landeskog will certainly be felt by the Avalanche, both on and off the ice. But with the talent and depth on their roster, they will still be a force to be reckoned with in the playoffs. It will be up to the rest of the team to step up and help carry them through the remainder of the postseason.",1
36,Illustrated Anne Frank book removed by Florida school,"A Florida school district has decided to remove an illustrated version of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" from its libraries, citing concerns about the depictions of nudity and sexual content.

The decision has prompted outrage from some members of the community, who argue that the book is an important piece of historical literature that should be available to students.

The book in question is a graphic novel adaptation of the classic memoir, which tells the story of a young Jewish girl forced to hide from the Nazis during World War II. The graphic novel version includes illustrations by David Polonsky and a script by Ari Folman.

In an email to the school district, a parent expressed concern about the book's content. ""I cannot understand why a book like this would be necessary or appropriate in our schools,"" the email read.

School officials subsequently decided to remove the book from libraries in the district, sparking a wave of criticism from civil liberties and free speech advocates.

""The decision to remove this book is deeply troubling and sends the wrong message to students,"" said Ashley Gorski, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Books like 'The Diary of Anne Frank' are important not only because they educate young people about history, but also because they promote empathy and understanding.""

Other supporters of the book argued that the illustrations are key to engaging younger readers with the story of Anne Frank.

""By presenting her story in a graphic novel format, the book is accessible to more students and helps to bring the story to life in a way that traditional literature may not do,"" said Karen Veazey, a parent of a student in the district.

The controversy has reignited debates over the role of school districts in regulating the content of books in their libraries. While some argue that it is the school district's job to ensure that materials are appropriate for all students, others contend that such restrictions on literary works violate principles of free speech and academic freedom.

The ""Diary of Anne Frank"" has long been a staple of school curricula, and the graphic novel adaptation has won widespread praise for its innovative approach to the classic work. The book has been translated into several languages and has been adapted into a successful play and film.

For now, the book remains off-limits in the school district, although some supporters of the book are continuing to push for its inclusion in libraries.

""We urge the school district to reconsider this decision and allow students access to this valuable and educational work,"" said Gorski. ""It is imperative that students have the opportunity to learn about history in all its complexity.""",1
37,Leaked documents may have origin in chatroom for gamers,"Leaked documents may have origin in chatroom for gamers

A trove of leaked documents that were recently published by media outlets may have originated in a chatroom for gamers, according to sources familiar with the situation. The leak, which contained sensitive information about various companies and government agencies, has raised concerns about cyber security and the dangers of online communication.

The chatroom in question is a popular online space where gamers from around the world come together to talk about their favorite games and share tips and tricks. It has a large and active community, with thousands of members who regularly participate in discussions and debates.

Sources say that the chatroom has been around for several years and has evolved into a hub for a variety of interests beyond just gaming. Members of the group reportedly discuss everything from politics and current events to technology and cybersecurity.

It is believed that the individuals responsible for the leak were members of this chatroom who had access to sensitive information through their jobs or other means. They allegedly used the chatroom as a platform to share the documents with others who were interested in exposing the contents to the public.

The leak has been described as one of the most significant in recent history, with the documents containing details about a wide range of topics. Among them were confidential memos from government agencies, sensitive financial information about major corporations, and personal data from millions of individuals.

The documents were first obtained by a group of hackers who claimed to have breached the servers of several organizations. They subsequently shared the information with journalists, who have been publishing reports based on the leaked data.

While it is still unclear exactly who was responsible for the leak, experts say that the incident underscores the growing threat of cyberattacks and highlights the need for better cybersecurity measures. The chatroom where the leak originated is just one example of the numerous online spaces where sensitive information can be shared and disseminated.

""Chatrooms, forums, and other online communities are increasingly becoming a vector for attacks,"" said Tom Kellermann, head of cybersecurity strategy at the software firm VMware. ""Individuals and organizations alike need to take steps to protect themselves from these threats, whether that means strengthening their passwords, using two-factor authentication, or implementing other security measures.""

Despite the seriousness of the leak, some members of the chatroom where the documents were originally shared have defended their actions. They argue that the information contained in the documents was in the public interest and that their actions were justified in exposing it.

""The government and corporations have been hiding things from us for too long,"" said one member of the chatroom in a recent interview. ""It's time for the truth to come out.""

However, others have expressed concern about the potentially damaging consequences of the leak. Some fear that the release of sensitive financial data could lead to market instability or that the exposure of personal data could put individuals at risk of identity theft or other forms of fraud.

Regardless of the ethical implications of the leak, there is no doubt that it has sparked a wider conversation about cybersecurity and the need for stronger protections against cyber threats. In recent years, there have been numerous high-profile cyberattacks targeting companies and organizations around the world. These attacks have highlighted the vulnerabilities in our current cybersecurity infrastructure and the need for more robust defenses.

Governments and businesses alike are beginning to take stronger measures to protect themselves against cyber threats. For example, the US government recently imposed sanctions on Russia in response to a series of cyberattacks. Meanwhile, many corporations are investing in new cybersecurity technologies and protocols to protect their data and systems.

The leak of these documents may serve as a wake-up call to those who have been slow to take action on cybersecurity. It is a stark reminder that the threat of cyber attacks is real and that we must all take steps to protect ourselves against them.

As the world becomes increasingly connected through technology, the risks of cyberattacks will only continue to grow. We must all remain vigilant and take the necessary precautions to ensure that our data and systems are secure. The chatroom where these leaked documents originated may have been a gathering place for gamers, but it ultimately served as a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity in all aspects of our lives.",1
38,Mountain teams in Slovenia rescue climbers stuck in the Alps,"Slovenian mountain rescue teams have pulled off a daring rescue mission to save four climbers stranded in the rugged Julian Alps of Slovenia. The group had embarked on a climbing trip to the Triglav National Park, but found themselves in a precarious position when one of them fell sick.

The climbers, three Slovenian nationals and a German, were stranded at an altitude of over 2,400 meters after the sick member of their group was unable to continue hiking. Realizing the danger of further ascent and the importance of quick action, they called emergency services for help.

A team of more than 20 rescuers was dispatched to the site, including members of the Slovenian Mountain Rescue Service and the Slovenian Armed Forces. They used a helicopter to airlift the stranded climbers to safety, after a difficult and treacherous operation. All four climbers were then taken to the hospital for observation and treatment.

The Slovenian authorities praised the professionalism and bravery of the rescue team in a statement. Despite facing challenging conditions and a high level of risk, they managed to execute the operation with precision and efficiency.

This latest incident highlights the importance of exercising caution while climbing in the Alps, as even experienced climbers can find themselves in dangerous situations.",1
39,Mini hydro company raises $18M to generate power in canals,"MINI HYDRO COMPANY RAISES $18M TO GENERATE POWER IN CANALS

A mini hydro company has raised $18 million in funding to generate power using the energy in canals. The company, called Canal Power, has developed a system that can generate electricity from the fast-moving water in canals, which is typically used for irrigation or transportation. 

The funding was raised from a mix of venture capital firms, impact investors, and angel investors. The company plans to use the funds to expand its operations and install its technology in more locations across the United States.

The Canal Power system works by using a turbine to generate electricity from the flow of water in the canal. The system can be installed directly in the canal, without the need for a dam or other major infrastructure. The company says that its technology is highly efficient, generating up to 50% more electricity than comparable hydro systems.

Canal Power says that its technology has several advantages over traditional hydroelectricity generation. Unlike traditional hydro plants, which require the construction of large dams and reservoirs, the Canal Power system can be installed in existing canals, which are already in place for other purposes. This eliminates the need for major infrastructure construction, reducing the cost and environmental impact of the project.

In addition, the company says that its system is highly scalable. Canal Power's technology can be installed in canals of any size, making it suitable for a wide range of project sizes.

The company has already installed its technology in several locations throughout the US, including California, Arizona, and Florida. In one project in Florida, Canal Power installed its system in a canal used for irrigation, generating electricity which was then sold to the local utility grid.

Canal Power says that its technology has the potential to make a significant impact on the energy industry. According to the company, there are over 75,000 miles of canals and other waterways in the United States that have the potential to generate electricity using their technology. If all of these canals were equipped with Canal Power's technology, it could generate enough electricity to power over 900,000 homes.

The company's technology has already been recognized for its potential. In 2019, Canal Power was selected as a finalist in the Cleantech Open accelerator program, which supports innovative clean energy companies. The company has also received funding from the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Agriculture.

Canal Power's approach to generating electricity is part of a growing trend towards distributed energy generation. Distributed energy refers to the generation of electricity on a small scale, using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. Distributed energy systems are typically installed close to the point of use, reducing the need for long-distance transmission infrastructure.

The trend towards distributed energy is driven by several factors, including falling costs for renewable energy technologies, concerns about climate change, and the need for more resilient energy grids. Distributed energy systems are seen as a way to increase energy security, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and provide more reliable and affordable energy to communities.

As Canal Power continues to expand its operations, the company's technology has the potential to provide a significant source of clean energy to communities across the United States. With the support of investors and forward-thinking policymakers, Canal Power's approach to energy generation could play an important role in the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable energy system.",1
40,Hearing pushed back for Alaska illustrator on threat charge,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska - The hearing for an Alaska illustrator charged with making online threats has been pushed back to next month.

The illustrator, whose real name is not being released, gained notoriety for illustrations depicting violent acts against prominent public figures. They were arrested in August on charges of making online threats against individuals and organizations.

The pretrial hearing, originally scheduled for Wednesday, has now been delayed until November 2nd. The illustrator's attorney, Sarah Douglas, requested the delay to allow time to review evidence in the case.

Douglas has said that her client's illustrations are artistic expressions and do not represent actual threats, but rather political commentary.

The FBI, however, argues that the illustrations, combined with the online threats, represent a clear danger to public safety.

The illustrator's detention hearing, held last month, drew a large crowd of supporters, who argued that the charges were a violation of free speech protections.

The illustrator, who has been held in federal custody since their arrest, faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

The case has drawn attention to the issue of free speech versus threats of violence, particularly in the context of political discourse.

In recent years, there has been a sharp rise in the use of social media to make threatening statements against public figures and organizations.

In 2018, for example, a Florida man was sentenced to five years in prison for making online threats against members of Congress. The man's attorneys argued that the statements were protected free speech, but the judge disagreed, citing the potential danger posed by the statements.

Legal experts say that the issue is complicated by the fact that there is no clear definition of what constitutes a true threat. Courts have generally held that a statement must be directed at a specific individual and convey a serious intent to harm in order to be considered a true threat.

The case of the Alaska illustrator is likely to be closely watched by legal scholars and civil libertarians, who will be following the proceedings closely to see how the court balances the competing interests of free speech and public safety.

41,Musk says owning Twitter 'painful' but needed to be done,"Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, admitted to owning a Twitter account can be “painful” but insisted it was necessary.

In a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Musk elaborated on the complicated relationship he has with Twitter, admitting that the platform has caused him personal and professional issues.

“Twitter’s a war zone,” Musk said. “If somebody’s gonna jump in the warzone, it’s like, okay, you’re in the arena. That’s fine. But realize, you are in an arena.”

Musk’s Twitter account, with over 38 million followers, has been the source of a number of controversies over the years. In 2018, Musk took to Twitter and called a British caver who helped rescue a group of Thai boys trapped in a cave a “pedo guy,” which led to a defamation trial where the jury ruled in favor of the caver. Similarly, he tweeted about Tesla going private and faced charges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over misleading investors, which ended in a settlement and Musk stepping down as the company’s chairman.

Despite the setbacks, Musk said he has no plans of deleting his account or hiring someone to take over it. “I feel like I want to be able to express myself. I think I’ve made some mistakes on Twitter,” he said. “There have been some errors in judgment, to be sure. But I think generally, my tweeting is not bad.”

Musk’s Twitter account, which he originally created to promote his companies, has turned into a platform for him to discuss a range of topics from cryptocurrency to artificial intelligence. However, he acknowledged that at times he has gone left of field, but he also said the platform helps him get a sense of what people are thinking.

“I think Twitter is important, particularly for me, because some of the criticisms will be right, and I will see that and then fix it. I can simply delete the tweet, issue a correction, and say what I meant to do,” he said.

While Musk painted Twitter as a necessary evil, he also highlighted its potential for harm.

“When you use Twitter, you put yourself in a kind of danger. You’re brushing up against the mob,” Musk said. “That’s the danger of Twitter.”",1
42,Italy temporarily blocks ChatGPT over privacy concerns,"In response to concerns over user privacy, Italy has temporarily blocked social media platform ChatGPT. The decision, taken by the country's data protection authority, came after the platform was found to be collecting user data without proper consent.

ChatGPT is a popular social media platform, with millions of users around the world. It allows users to create a profile, add friends, and engage in chat conversations with other users. The platform has been praised for its ease of use and its privacy features, which allow users to control who can see their profiles and messages.

However, the platform has also faced criticism over privacy concerns in the past. Last year, several media outlets reported that ChatGPT was collecting user data without proper consent, and that the platform was sharing this data with third-party advertisers. These reports led to a public outcry and calls for greater privacy protections for social media users.

In response, Italy's data protection authority launched an investigation into ChatGPT's data collection practices. The investigation found that the platform was indeed collecting user data without proper consent, and that this data was being shared with third-party advertisers.

As a result, the authority ordered ChatGPT to stop collecting user data and to delete all data that had already been collected. The authority also temporarily blocked the platform in Italy, pending further investigations.

In a statement, the authority said that it was ""concerned about the impact that ChatGPT's data collection practices could have on user privacy. We take our responsibility to protect the privacy of Italian citizens very seriously, and we will not hesitate to take action to ensure that their rights are respected.""

The authority's decision to block ChatGPT has been met with mixed reactions. Some users have praised the move as a necessary step towards protecting their privacy, while others have criticized it as an overreaction.

""I'm glad that the authorities are taking this seriously,"" said Maria Russo, a ChatGPT user from Milan. ""I don't want my data to be shared with advertisers without my consent. I think this is an important issue that needs to be addressed.""

However, other users have expressed frustration at not being able to access the platform. ""I use ChatGPT to stay in touch with my friends and family,"" said Marco Rossi, a student from Rome. ""I don't understand why they had to block the whole platform just because of some data privacy issues. It seems like an overreaction to me.""

ChatGPT has also responded to the authority's decision, arguing that it takes user privacy seriously and that it is committed to complying with all relevant laws and regulations.

""We are aware of the concerns raised by the Italian data protection authority, and we are taking them very seriously,"" said a spokesperson for ChatGPT. ""We have already taken steps to address these concerns, including updating our privacy policy and implementing new safeguards to protect user data.""

The spokesperson added that the platform is working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and that it hopes to be able to resume normal service in Italy soon.

The incident highlights the growing importance of data privacy in the age of social media. With millions of users around the world, social media platforms have the ability to collect vast amounts of data about their users, ranging from their online conversations to their browsing habits.

However, this data collection has raised concerns about privacy, with many users worried that their personal data is being shared with third-party companies without their knowledge or consent.

Governments around the world have responded to these concerns by introducing new regulations aimed at protecting user privacy. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, gives users greater control over their personal data and requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting or sharing user data.

Italy's decision to temporarily block ChatGPT is likely to serve as a warning to other social media platforms, reminding them of the importance of complying with data privacy regulations and respecting user privacy.

As the use of social media continues to grow around the world, it is likely that we will see more incidents like this in the future. It is therefore important for governments, regulators, and social media companies to work together to ensure that user privacy is protected, and that users are aware of their rights and how their data is being used.",1
43,New India-born World Bank chief,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The World Bank has named its next president and the decision has been met with mixed reactions. The institution announced on Monday that it had named India-born economist, Anshula Kant, as the new chief.

Kant, a former employee of State Bank of India, will be the first female chief financial officer for the World Bank. She also holds a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's degree in cost accountant studies and will assume her new role in September.

The 58-year-old Kant will succeed Jim Yong Kim, who left the post in January to join a private equity firm. Until her appointment, interim president Kristalina Georgieva had been leading the World Bank.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the appointment of Kant, saying ""her expertise in finance will be an asset for the Bank."" Kant has more than 35 years of experience in banking and finance.

The World Bank is a global lending organization that aims to reduce poverty through lending and technical assistance. It has 189 member countries and lends about $60 billion annually.

Kant's appointment comes amid controversy over the World Bank's leadership selection process. Critics have called for a more transparent and competitive process to ensure the best qualified candidates are chosen, rather than relying on the tacit endorsement of the US.

In recent years, the US has been able to exert control over the World Bank's leadership, as it has traditionally held the position of president of the institution. The current administration has indicated it wants to continue that tradition.

But Kant's appointment may be seen as a step toward breaking that tradition, particularly as the World Bank faces increasing pressure to diversify its leadership and address issues of representation and accountability.

During the selection process, some observers suggested that the bank should choose a candidate based on merit, rather than nationality. Others have called for a candidate from a developing country to lead the institution.

Kant's appointment was met with mixed reactions, particularly from those who believe the World Bank needs more sweeping reforms. Some experts argue that, while Kant's experience in finance is commendable, the institution needs to address more systemic issues of inequality and poverty.

Others see Kant's appointment as a positive step toward a more inclusive governing structure. In her new role, Kant will have an opportunity to address issues of representation and accountability within the World Bank.

The World Bank has been criticized in recent years for supporting projects that have led to environmental degradation and human rights abuses. Critics say that the institution has failed to adequately address these issues and must do more to ensure that its lending and technical assistance programs are aligned with its stated goals of reducing poverty and promoting development.

Kant's appointment may be seen as an opportunity to address these concerns, particularly as she will be joining the institution at a time when it is facing increased scrutiny and pressure to reform.

In a statement, Kant said she was honored by her appointment and committed to the World Bank's mission of reducing poverty and promoting development. She also emphasized the importance of addressing systemic issues of inequality and ensuring that the bank's programs are sustainable and aligned with the needs of the people it serves.

Kant's appointment may also be seen as a win for gender diversity in finance. Women are underrepresented in leadership positions across the financial industry, particularly in developing countries, where cultural barriers often prevent women from pursuing careers in finance.

Kant is one of several recent appointments of women to key leadership positions in the financial industry. In 2018, Christine Lagarde was appointed the first female president of the European Central Bank, and Janet Yellen became the first female Treasury Secretary in the US.

Despite these strides, gender inequality in finance remains a significant challenge, particularly in developing countries. The World Bank has made efforts to address this issue, through initiatives like its Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which provides funding and technical assistance to women-led businesses.

Kant's appointment is a significant step forward for the World Bank and for women in finance. It underscores the importance of diversity and inclusion in leadership positions, particularly in institutions like the World Bank that have a critical impact on global development and poverty reduction.

It remains to be seen how Kant will address the challenges facing the World Bank, particularly in the areas of environmental sustainability, human rights, and accountability. But her appointment is a positive sign of progress toward a more inclusive and representative global financial system.",1
44,Nurse pleads guilty to replacing fentanyl with saline,"In a shocking case that raises serious questions about patient safety and medication administration, a nurse in Ohio has pleaded guilty to replacing fentanyl, a powerful painkiller, with saline.

According to court documents, the nurse, identified as Bridgette Gibbs, was working at a hospital in Columbus, Ohio, in 2019 when she deliberately diluted vials of fentanyl and replaced the drug with saline solution. Officials say that she then administered the saline to patients, putting them at risk of experiencing extreme pain and suffering.

The motive behind Gibbs' actions remains unclear, but she has now pleaded guilty to charges of tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deception. She faces up to 14 years in prison and a fine of $500,000 when she is sentenced.

The hospital where Gibbs worked has not been named, but officials have assured the public that they have taken steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again in the future. In a statement, the hospital said that they were ""deeply disturbed"" by the nurse's behavior.

""This kind of behavior is unacceptable in any healthcare setting and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our patients from harm,"" the statement read.

The case highlights the need for rigorous checks and controls in hospitals and other healthcare settings, to prevent similar incidents from occurring and to safeguard patients' health and wellbeing.",1
45,Abortion pill rulings in conflict,"Abortion pill rulings in conflict

Two recent court rulings on the use of abortion pills have created a stark contrast in how medical professionals and lawmakers view access to the drug.

In July, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new guidelines for the use of medication-induced abortions, which allows women to obtain the pills through mail or telemedicine, as opposed to in-person visits with a medical professional. This change was seen as a victory for reproductive rights advocates who have long pushed for increased access to abortion care.

However, just weeks later, a federal judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order blocking the FDA's new guidelines. The judge's order was a response to a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups who claimed that the new guidelines posed a danger to women's health and safety.

The conflicting rulings have left many unsure of what the future of abortion pill access will look like in the United States.

Medication-induced abortion is a non-surgical procedure in which a woman takes two different pills to terminate a pregnancy. According to the Guttmacher Institute, medication-induced abortions made up 39% of all abortions in the United States in 2017.

The FDA's decision to expand access to the abortion pill was based on scientific evidence that showed the medication is safe and effective for use at home. Previously, women seeking medication-induced abortions were required to visit a medical professional in-person, which posed a burden for those who lived in rural areas or who had limited access to transportation.

Reproductive rights advocates celebrated the FDA's decision as a victory for gender equity and reproductive justice.

""This is a crucial step in expanding access to reproductive healthcare for all people, regardless of their zip code,"" said Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood.

However, anti-abortion groups immediately sought legal action against the FDA's decision, claiming that it put women's health and safety at risk.

""For over 20 years, the FDA has limited the use of these drugs to reduce the danger to women,"" said Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion research group.

These groups argue that by allowing women to obtain the abortion pill through mail or telemedicine, medical professionals will have less control over the drug's administration and could lead to complications or even death.

In response to the lawsuit, the federal judge in Maryland issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the FDA from enforcing its new guidelines. However, the order does not apply to those who had already received the medication prior to the ruling.

Reproductive rights advocates argue that the anti-abortion groups' claims about the danger of the abortion pill are unfounded and driven by ideology, rather than science.

""Patients should be able to access medication abortion care without medically unnecessary barriers that undermine their safety and dignity,"" said Rachel Fey, director of public policy at The National Women's Law Center.

Critics of the order argue that it will have a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, particularly women of color and those who live in rural areas where access to abortion care is already limited.

""As always, those who are marginalized and low-income are the ones who bear the brunt of anti-abortion policies and rhetoric,"" said Suzanna de Baca, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho.

The conflicting court rulings signal a larger debate over the future of reproductive healthcare in the United States. With the recent appointment of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who is seen as hostile to reproductive rights, many are concerned about the legal battles that lie ahead.

""We are already seeing real-world harm from attempts to restrict access to care through the courts, the states, and the federal government,"" said McGill Johnson.

Despite the challenges ahead, reproductive rights advocates remain steadfast in their commitment to expanding access to abortion care and supporting those who need it.

""At Planned Parenthood, we will continue to fight for everyone's right to access the full range of reproductive healthcare, including abortion care,"" said de Baca.

As the nation grapples with this complex and controversial issue, it is clear that access to abortion care will remain a contentious topic for years to come.",1
46,Brazil's Lula in Shanghai on visit to boost ties with China,"Former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is currently on a visit to China as part of efforts to bolster ties between the two countries. Lula arrived in Shanghai on Monday and is expected to hold meetings with Chinese officials and business leaders during his stay.

The visit comes as China seeks to deepen its economic and political ties with Latin America, a region that has historically been dominated by the United States. Brazil, as the largest economy in the region, is seen as a key player in this effort.

Lula, who served as president from 2003 to 2010, is known for his left-wing politics and populist rhetoric. During his time in office, he oversaw a period of rapid economic growth in Brazil and implemented a number of social programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality.

Since leaving office, Lula has remained an influential figure in Brazilian politics and has been a vocal critic of current President Jair Bolsonaro. He was released from prison earlier this year after serving 580 days on corruption charges, which he has denied.

Lula's visit to China is his first overseas trip since his release from prison and is seen as an opportunity to promote Brazil's interests and strengthen ties with one of its most important trading partners.

China is Brazil's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $98.9 billion in 2019. The two countries have also cooperated on a number of infrastructure projects in recent years, including the construction of a railway linking Brazil's Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

During his visit, Lula is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other high-ranking officials to discuss ways to deepen cooperation between the two countries.

The trip has already sparked controversy, however, with some critics accusing Lula of hypocrisy for visiting China, a country that has been criticized for its human rights record and its treatment of political dissidents.

Lula has dismissed these criticisms, arguing that Brazil should be focused on building positive relationships with all countries, including those with different political systems.

""China is a great country, and we have to respect it,"" he said in an interview with Chinese state-run media. ""We only have to remember that we have our values, our democracy, our respect for human rights, and our way of seeing the world.""

Despite these comments, some observers have raised concerns about China's growing influence in Latin America and the potential risks of becoming overly dependent on the Chinese economy.

There are also concerns about the environmental impact of China's investments in the region. China has been criticized for its role in deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, with Brazilian officials accusing Chinese companies of illegal logging and land-grabbing.

Lula has acknowledged these concerns and has pledged to work with Chinese officials to address them.

""China is part of the solution to the problems of the world, but we have to be very careful not to leave behind the environmental principles that guide us,"" he said.

Despite these concerns, many analysts see Lula's visit as a positive development for Brazil-China relations. In an article published in the China Daily, Brazilian economist Paulo Nogueira Batista argued that Lula's ""progressive vision"" could help to steer China's relations with Latin America in a more equitable and sustainable direction.

""He can contribute to the strengthening of the multilateral system, to the preservation of the environment, and to the promotion of a more equitable global economic system,"" Batista wrote.

Ultimately, the success of Lula's visit will depend on whether it is able to translate into concrete benefits for Brazil. With the country facing a number of economic challenges, including high unemployment and slow growth, the government will be hoping that closer ties with China can help to boost investment and exports.

For Lula, the visit is an opportunity to demonstrate his continued relevance on the global stage and to reassert his commitment to promoting social justice and economic development in Brazil and beyond. Whether he is able to succeed in these goals remains to be seen, but for now, his presence in Shanghai is a reminder of the enduring importance of Brazil-China relations.",1
47,"The losing is done, NBA teams now await 7-foot-3 Wembanyama","As the NBA season approaches each year, there is always a level of anticipation and excitement for the incoming rookie class. However, this year's class has a player that has garnered more attention than any other in recent memory – 7-foot-3 Victor Wembanyama.

Wembanyama, a French center, has been turning heads with his dominant play at the youth level. At just 18 years old, he has already made waves in the European basketball scene, playing for Paris Basketball in LNB Pro B, the second-tier league in France. He has also represented the French national team at the youth level, most recently averaging 20.4 points, 13.4 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks per game at the FIBA U17 Basketball World Cup in 2019.

But it's not just his size and stats that have people talking. Wembanyama possesses a unique skill set for someone his size, with the ability to shoot the ball from beyond the arc and handle it like a guard. It's a combination that has drawn comparisons to NBA stars like Kevin Durant and Kristaps Porzingis.

There's a reason why Wembanyama is being called a generational talent – he has the potential to change the game of basketball as we know it. And NBA teams are well aware of this fact.

Leading up to the 2022 NBA Draft, where Wembanyama is expected to be a top pick, teams are already taking notice of the young center. Scouts and executives have flown to France to watch him play, with some even attending practices to catch a glimpse of his rare talents.

The interest is understandable – centers with Wembanyama's size and skill set don't come around often. In the NBA, where teams are always searching for the next game-changing player, Wembanyama could be just that.

But it's not just his potential on the court that is intriguing to NBA teams. Wembanyama's hype also stems from his unique upbringing and background. Born to Congolese parents in France, he grew up in a multicultural household where he was exposed to different cultures and languages.

Wembanyama's father, a former basketball player himself, recognized his son's potential at a young age and helped guide him on his basketball journey. The family was also aided by the Paris-based Tony Parker Adéquat Academy, a youth basketball academy founded by former NBA player Tony Parker and former coach Jean-Claude Killy.

The combination of Wembanyama's natural talent, work ethic, and supportive family and academy have all contributed to his meteoric rise as a basketball player. And now, as he prepares to enter the NBA and face the best players in the world, he credits his upbringing for shaping him as a person as well.

""I have more than just basketball skills. I can speak multiple languages, I can adapt to different cultures, I'm a good teammate,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. ""Basketball is not just about talent. It's also about the person you are.""

As the hype surrounding Wembanyama continues to grow, NBA teams are already envisioning what he could bring to their franchises. His ability to stretch the floor with his shooting and handle the ball like a guard could open up new avenues for offenses. Defensively, his size and shot-blocking could be a game-changer for teams looking to anchor their defense.

But it's not just about what Wembanyama can do on the court. Teams are also taking into account his character and work ethic, which have been lauded by those who have worked with him.

""Victor is a hard worker. Every time he steps onto the court, he wants to improve and get better,"" said Julien Desbottes, the head coach of Paris Basketball, in an interview with ESPN. ""He sees basketball as his life, and he's willing to put in the work to achieve his goals.""

It's a sentiment echoed by Tony Parker and the staff at his academy, who have seen firsthand the dedication and drive that Wembanyama possesses.

""He's a worker. He's a gym rat. He just loves basketball,"" Parker said in an interview with The Ringer. ""He's always been the first one in the gym and the last one to leave. He wants to win, he wants to be the best, and he has this mentality that he wants to work for it.""

But as the hype surrounding Wembanyama continues to grow, he is remaining focused on the task at hand. He knows that there will be expectations placed on him as he enters the NBA, but he's ready for the challenge.

""I don't think about the hype. I don't think about the draft. I just focus on being the best player I can be,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. ""I know that the NBA is the best league in the world, and I want to compete against the best players and prove that I belong.""

For NBA teams, the anticipation for Wembanyama's arrival continues to build. They know that he has the potential to change the game in ways that we haven't seen before. And are waiting eagerly to see what he can do on the biggest stage of them all.

In the words of Parker, ""everyone who knows basketball knows who he is."" And now, with Wembanyama's NBA debut just around the corner, the rest of the basketball world is about to find out as well.",1
48,Washington Commanders timeline under Dan Snyder,"Washington Commanders timeline under Dan Snyder

For over two decades, Dan Snyder has been the owner of the Washington Commanders football team (previously known as the Washington Redskins). During his tenure, the team has undergone numerous changes, from their name to their coaching staff and performance on the field. As some controversies have come to light in recent years, we take a closer look at the Washington Commanders timeline under Dan Snyder.

1999-2001: The Snyder Era Begins
In May of 1999, Dan Snyder purchased the Washington Commanders for a reported $800 million, making him one of the youngest owners in the NFL at the time. Snyder quickly went to work, hiring former San Francisco 49ers head coach and two-time Super Bowl champion George Seifert as the team's new head coach. However, Seifert lasted just one season and Snyder turned to former Denver Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan to lead the team.

2002-2003: Struggles on the Field
Under Shanahan's leadership, the team improved slightly but ultimately finished 7-9 and 5-11 in his first two seasons. Snyder continued to make changes, firing several members of the coaching staff and bringing in new players, including wide receiver Laveranues Coles and defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield.

2004-2006: Success with Joe Gibbs
In 2004, Snyder brought in Hall of Fame head coach Joe Gibbs in an attempt to turn the struggling franchise around. Gibbs had previously led the team to three Super Bowl victories in the 1980s and early 90s. Under Gibbs, the team made the playoffs twice but failed to reach the Super Bowl.

2007-2008: The Jim Zorn Experiment
In 2008, Snyder made a controversial decision to hire Jim Zorn, who had never been a head coach in the NFL, to lead the team. Zorn's tenure was marked by controversy, including disagreements with Snyder and the front office. The team finished with a 8-8 record in Zorn's first season, but fell to 4-12 in 2009.

2010-2012: Shanahan Returns
Following Zorn's firing at the end of the 2009 season, Snyder once again turned to Shanahan to lead the team. Shanahan's second tenure with the team was marked by inconsistency on the field, as the team finished with records of 6-10, 5-11, and 10-6 (but missed the playoffs) in his three seasons.

2013-2019: The Jay Gruden Era
In 2014, Snyder hired former Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Jay Gruden to be the team's new head coach. The team had some success under Gruden, including an NFC East title in 2015. However, the team failed to make the playoffs in each of the last three years of Gruden's tenure and he was fired midway through the 2019 season.

2019-2020: Controversy Surrounding the Team Name and Culture
In July 2020, the team announced that it would retire its longtime name, the Washington Redskins, amid mounting pressure from sponsors and activists who considered it offensive to Native Americans. The team would eventually announce their new name in 2021, becoming the Washington Commanders.

Around the same time, a report by the Washington Post detailed allegations of sexual harassment and verbal abuse within the team's front office. The report described a culture of toxic behavior and harassment that had been pervasive within the organization for years. In response, Snyder hired an independent law firm to conduct an investigation into the allegations.

2020-2021: Ron Rivera Takes Over
In January 2020, Snyder hired former Carolina Panthers head coach Ron Rivera to be the team's new head coach. Rivera's tenure got off to a rocky start, as the team finished with a 7-9 record in his first season. However, the team has shown glimpses of promise, particularly on the defensive side of the ball.

In July 2020, Snyder announced that three minority owners of the team - Fred Smith, Dwight Schar, and Robert Rothman - were seeking to sell their shares in the team. In early 2021, Snyder reached an agreement to buy out the minority owners and gain sole control of the team. This move was seen as a way to streamline decision-making within the organization and allow Snyder to implement his vision for the Commanders.

Looking Ahead
As the Washington Commanders prepare for the upcoming season, there is cautious optimism among fans and analysts. The team has made several key additions in the offseason, including quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and wide receiver Curtis Samuel. However, there are still questions surrounding the team's offensive line and their ability to consistently perform at a high level.

Off the field, the team's new name has been met with mixed reactions from fans and critics alike. Some have praised the move as a sign of progress and inclusivity, while others have criticized the new name as bland and uninspired.

As the team moves forward, all eyes will be on Dan Snyder and his leadership of the franchise. With nearly 20 years under his belt as owner, there are still many who question his ability to lead the team to sustained success. However, with a new coaching staff in place and a renewed commitment to addressing past issues within the organization, there is reason to hope that the Washington Commanders can finally turn the page on a troubled past and build a brighter future.",1
49,NYC hires former educator to slaughter rats,"New York City has hired a former educator, who is also a self-proclaimed rat expert, to lead the efforts in slaughtering rats in the city.

Richard Reynolds, who previously taught biology at a high school in Queens, has been hired by the city to head a new task force dedicated to tackling the city's rat problem. The task force, which will also include sanitation workers and pest control specialists, will focus on targeting rat hotspots across the city and implementing new strategies to control the rat population.

Rats are a common sight in New York City, with an estimated population of over two million. They are known to carry diseases and can cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Despite the city's ongoing efforts to manage the rat population, the problem persists.

Reynolds, who has been passionate about rats for over a decade, believes that he can bring a fresh perspective to the issue. He has spent years researching rats and has even written a book on the topic, titled 'The Rat Problem: A Comprehensive Guide'.

""I have always been interested in rats and their behavior,"" said Reynolds. ""I believe that by understanding rats better, we can come up with more effective solutions to eliminate them from our city.""

Reynolds believes that one of the key reasons why the city has struggled to control the rat population is because they have been using the same methods for decades. He believes that a more proactive approach is needed, including targeted baiting, the use of cameras to monitor rat activity, and increased public education efforts.

""The city has been using the same methods for a long time, and it's clear that they are not working,"" said Reynolds. ""We need to be more proactive in our approach and use new techniques to control the rat population.""

Reynolds also believes that public education is a key component of rat control. He plans to work with schools and community centers to educate people about rat behavior and how to prevent infestations.

""We need to teach people that rats are not just a nuisance, but also a public health hazard,"" said Reynolds. ""By educating people about rat behavior and how to prevent infestations, we can create a safer and healthier New York City.""

Reynolds' appointment has been met with mixed reactions. Some are skeptical of his qualifications and believe that the city should be focusing on more immediate issues, such as crime and affordable housing.

Others, however, are optimistic about Reynolds' appointment and believe that his expertise could be beneficial in tackling the city's rat problem.

""I think it's great that the city is bringing in someone with a fresh perspective on the issue,"" said John Smith, a resident of the Upper East Side. ""Hopefully, Richard Reynolds can come up with some new solutions to finally get rid of these pests.""

Reynolds has already begun his work with the task force and is confident that his approach will yield positive results.

""I believe that we can make a significant dent in the rat population in the next few years,"" said Reynolds. ""It's not going to be easy, but with the right strategies and a committed team, we can make our city cleaner and safer for everyone.""

New York City is not the only city struggling with a rat problem. Cities across the country, including Chicago, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles, have also been battling rat infestations for years.

Some cities have taken a more aggressive approach to rat control, such as Chicago, which implemented a $1 million program in 2019 to target rat hotspots across the city. The program included the use of dry ice to kill rats and the deployment of extra sanitation workers to clean up rat-infested areas.

Whether Reynolds' approach will be effective remains to be seen, but it is clear that rat control remains a pressing issue in many cities across the country.

For Reynolds, the work is personal. He sees rats not just as a nuisance, but as a fascinating species that deserves to be understood and respected.

""Rats are incredibly adaptable creatures that have found ways to thrive in urban environments,"" said Reynolds. ""While we may not want them in our cities, we can still learn a lot from them and appreciate their resilience.""

As Reynolds and the task force continue their work, residents of New York City are hopeful that this new approach will finally bring an end to the city's rat problem.",1
50,Bond limits for people with violent charges clears SC senate,"Columbia, South Carolina - The South Carolina Senate has passed a bill that would limit bond amounts for individuals with violent charges.

The legislation, which passed with a 42-0 vote on Wednesday, would require judges to set higher bond amounts for those charged with violent crimes, such as murder, rape, and domestic violence.

Supporters of the measure argue that it will help prevent dangerous individuals from being released on low bond amounts, allowing them to continue to pose a threat to the public.

""We've seen too many instances where someone charged with a violent crime is released on a low bond and goes on to commit even more heinous crimes,"" said State Senator Gerald Malloy, a Democrat who co-sponsored the bill. ""This legislation is about protecting our communities by ensuring that those who pose a danger to society are kept behind bars.""

The bill's supporters also argue that it will address racial disparities in the justice system, as African Americans and other minorities are often disproportionately impacted by high bond amounts.

""Communities of color have long been subjected to discriminatory bail practices that keep individuals locked up simply because they can't afford to pay,"" said State Senator Marlon Kimpson, a Democrat who also co-sponsored the bill. ""This legislation is a step toward addressing those inequities and creating a more just system.""

But opponents of the measure argue that it could have negative consequences for defendants who have not yet been convicted of a crime, potentially keeping them behind bars before trial for extended periods of time.

""Setting higher bond amounts for individuals charged with violent crimes sounds good in theory, but in reality, it could harm defendants who are presumed innocent until proven guilty,"" said State Senator Lee Bright, a Republican who voted against the bill. ""We need to be careful not to infringe upon the constitutional rights of those accused of crimes.""

The bill now heads to the South Carolina House of Representatives for consideration.

If passed and signed into law by Governor Henry McMaster, South Carolina would join a handful of other states that have implemented similar measures to limit bond amounts for violent offenders.

In New Jersey, for example, a 2017 reform to the state's bail system eliminated cash bail and instead focused on assessing a defendant's specific risk of flight or danger to the community when setting bail or release conditions.

The South Carolina bill does not go quite as far as New Jersey's, as it would not eliminate cash bail altogether. Instead, it would simply require higher bond amounts for those charged with violent crimes.

But reform advocates say that any effort to limit the use of cash bail in the justice system is a step in the right direction.

""Cash bail often unfairly punishes low-income defendants who are not a danger to the community,"" said Emily Galvin-Almanza, executive director of Partners for Justice, a national criminal justice reform organization. ""By implementing reforms like this one in South Carolina, we can move toward a more fair and just bail system that protects public safety and respects the rights of defendants.""

The South Carolina bill has received support from law enforcement officials and victim advocacy groups, who say that it will help protect victims of violent crimes and their families.

""We've seen too many cases where a defendant is released on a low bond and goes on to harm another victim,"" said James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, a national law enforcement group. ""This legislation is a common-sense approach to ensuring that violent offenders are held accountable and that victims are protected.""

It remains to be seen whether the South Carolina House of Representatives will pass the bill and send it to Governor McMaster's desk for signature. But with broad bipartisan support in the Senate, the measure appears to have a strong chance of becoming law in the near future.",1

52,"Nurse scores in OT, Canada beats Sweden 3-2 to dodge upset","HELSINKI (AP) — Laura Fortino scored at 2:21 of overtime to give Canada a 3-2 win over Sweden in quarterfinals play of the women's world hockey championship on Thursday.

Fortino beat goaltender Minatsu Murase with a low shot from the slot as Canada dodged an upset that would have been one of the biggest in the tournament’s history. 

Canada, the 10-time defending champion, advanced to face Switzerland in the semifinals on Saturday. The United States will play Finland in the other semi on Friday.

""It’s always a battle when we play Sweden. They’re an incredibly skilled team and they never quit,"" said Canadian captain Marie-Philip Poulin, who had a goal and an assist in the win. ""But we find a way to win and that’s all that matters.""

Sweden, which had just one win in five games in the preliminary round, held a 2-1 lead in the game early in the third period on a goal by Emma Nordin.

But Canada tied it on a power-play goal by Rebecca Johnston with 9:08 left in regulation, and Fortino’s winner completed the comeback.

""We started getting pucks to the net more and finding ways to create more offense,"" Poulin said. ""We stuck with our game and never got away from it.""

Victoria Bach also scored for Canada, which outshot Sweden 36-19 in the game.

""We’re a good team and we know we have the potential to come back in games when we’re down,"" said Fortino, who also had an assist in the game.

Sweden was the last team to beat Canada at this tournament, with a preliminary-round win in 2006 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Swedes also knocked Canada out of the 2019 world championship with a quarterfinal win but Thursday’s result didn’t provide them with the same level of satisfaction.

""It’s tough right now, it’s really hard,"" Sweden captain Jenni Asserholt said. ""It felt like we were going to win it but then it’s over. We played great as a team and gave it our all but it wasn’t enough today.""

Sweden goaltender Minatsu Murase made several key saves to help her team build its early lead, including denying Ann-Sophie Bettez on a breakaway in the first period.

""She was amazing out there. She gave us a chance to win,"" Asserholt said.

Canada, which hasn't lost a game at this tournament since the preliminary round in 2017, acknowledged the depth of the talent pool in women's hockey is increasing and there will be no easy games.

""I think it’s great for the sport to see so many good teams coming together,"" Poulin said. ""We’re not going to have easy games anymore, and we’ve got to be ready for anything.""",1
53,"Ukraine stands firm on Crimea, wants Russia out of all areas","KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukraine's new government is standing firm on its demand for Russia to pull out of Crimea and other areas of eastern Ukraine still under Moscow's control, despite increasing pressure from the Kremlin to recognize their invasions as legitimate.

The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent military intervention in eastern Ukraine have triggered one of the most severe crises in Europe since the end of the Cold War, leaving parts of the country under the control of separatists and Kiev without control of its borders.

Although the conflict in eastern Ukraine has faded from international headlines, it continues to simmer with sporadic fighting and occasional ceasefire violations. Meanwhile, Ukraine's western allies have imposed economic sanctions on Russia and lent military aid to Kiev but have stopped short of a military intervention to drive Russia out completely.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, has shown no sign of backing down, saying at a news conference earlier this month that he remains committed to seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis, but that Ukraine's sovereignty must be respected.

""We understand that this is not only a problem for Ukraine, but it is a problem for the whole world, because if Ukraine is not respected, it will create problems not only for our country, but for other countries in the region,"" Zelenskyy said.

At the same time, Zelenskyy was keen to manage expectations and avoid raising false hopes of a quick solution. He acknowledged that the conflict in eastern Ukraine was ""not a simple problem"" and said it would take time to resolve.

Although Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in the conflict and accused Kiev of instigating the unrest, Ukraine and its Western allies have blamed the Russian government of providing military and financial support to the separatists in eastern Ukraine and maintaining troops in the annexed Crimea.

The issue has been further complicated by the fact that many ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine and in Crimea feel more aligned with Moscow than with Kiev. During the annexation, Russia cited the need to protect ethnic Russians from persecution by Ukraine's government.

Ukraine's new government has taken a hard stance on the situation, announcing a plan last year to reclaim control of the rebel-held areas in the east and setting a goal of reclaiming full control of its borders by the end of 2020. However, the plan has not yet been put into action, and the conflict remains in stalemate.

The ongoing conflict has also taken a heavy toll on Ukraine's economy, with the country's GDP shrinking by 11% in 2015 alone. In recent years, Ukraine's economy has slowly begun to recover, but the country still faces significant challenges, including corruption and political instability.

Despite the difficulties, Ukraine's leaders remain committed to pursuing a peaceful solution to the conflict, even as they demand Russia's withdrawal from Crimea and other occupied territories.

""Ukraine is committed to a peaceful solution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, but we will not compromise on our sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" said Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in a statement earlier this week. ""Russia must end its aggression and withdraw from Crimea and other areas under its control in Eastern Ukraine.""

Alongside its demands, Ukraine has also urged its Western allies to maintain pressure on Russia, saying that economic sanctions and increased military aid are necessary to prevent further aggression.

“Sanctions are critical, and we will work with our international partners to ensure that they are effective,” Kuleba said. “We also call on our allies to continue to provide military aid to Ukraine.”

However, Ukraine's calls have largely fallen on deaf ears, with Russia's economic and political clout making it difficult for Ukraine to attract support from its Western allies.

In the meantime, the conflict in eastern Ukraine shows little sign of abating, with fighting and violations of the ceasefire continuing to cause casualties and disrupt life for residents on both sides.

Despite the challenges, Zelenskyy and his government remain committed to finding a peaceful resolution, even if it means acknowledging the realities of the situation.

""We are not naive, we understand that the resumption of peace talks is an important step, but we cannot make any concessions that would compromise our sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We are ready to work with our partners in the West to find a way forward, but we cannot do it alone.""",1
54,North I-5 reopens in southwest Washington after landslide,"TOUT: Drivers in southwest Washington can breathe a sigh of relief as the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 have finally reopened after being closed for a landslide.

After days of closure, authorities have cleared the debris from the landslide and made the necessary repairs allowing the northbound lanes of I-5 to be reopened to traffic. The landslide occurred last week, and the closure caused significant traffic disruptions and delays for commuters in the area.

Several workers were involved in the cleanup and repair process, which was complicated by the ongoing rain and mudslides in the region. The landslide had caused significant damage to the roadway, and repair work was required before the road could be reopened.

Commuters are urged to use caution while driving through the area and to be alert for any possible disruptions. Authorities are also closely monitoring the situation, and any further landslides may require additional road closures to ensure the safety of drivers.",1
55,OpenAI to offer remedies to resolve Italy's ChatGPT ban,"OpenAI, the leading provider of artificial intelligence technologies, is set to offer a remedy to the recent ChatGPT ban in Italy. The company announced on Monday that it is working with Italian authorities to help resolve the issue and develop a solution that satisfies both parties.

The ChatGPT ban, which was implemented in early September, prohibits the use of the chatbot technology in Italy. The decision was made after concerns were raised about the potential misuse of the technology and its ability to influence individuals negatively.

Experts at OpenAI have been working on solutions to address these concerns and ensure that ChatGPT can be used responsibly. The company has already developed a number of measures to prevent misuse, including filters to detect and block harmful content.

OpenAI has also outlined a set of guidelines for the ethical and responsible use of chatbot technology. These guidelines include maintaining transparency in the use of the technology, ensuring that users are aware they are dealing with a chatbot, and protecting user privacy by storing data securely.

The company's efforts to address the concerns around ChatGPT have been welcomed by Italian authorities, who are keen to find a way to reverse the ban. In a statement, the Italian government expressed its appreciation for OpenAI's willingness to work with them and develop solutions that ensure the responsible use of chatbot technology.

""We believe that artificial intelligence technologies have enormous potential to benefit society, but we also recognize that there are legitimate concerns about their impact,"" said an OpenAI spokesperson. ""We are committed to working with Italian authorities to address these concerns and ensure that chatbot technology can be used responsibly and ethically.""

The ChatGPT ban in Italy has sparked a wider debate about the regulation of artificial intelligence technologies. While chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in customer service and personal assistant roles, concerns have been raised about their potential to manipulate individuals and spread false information.

However, many experts argue that these concerns can be addressed through responsible use of the technology and appropriate regulation. OpenAI's efforts to develop guidelines for the ethical use of chatbot technology are seen as a positive step towards achieving this.

The company's collaboration with Italian authorities is also being seen as a model for how other countries can tackle similar issues around the regulation of artificial intelligence. By working together to address concerns and develop solutions, technology providers and regulators can ensure that AI technologies are used in a way that benefits society as a whole.",1
56,Israeli police absolved in killing of Palestinian at Al-Aqsa,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli police have been absolved of any wrongdoing by the Israeli Justice Ministry in the killing of a Palestinian man at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem last year.

The incident, which occurred in May 2020, led to widespread protests among Palestinians and heightened tensions in the region. The victim, 32-year-old Iyad al-Hallaq, was a resident of East Jerusalem and suffered from autism. He was shot dead by Israeli police officers after they mistook him for an assailant.

In a statement released on Thursday, the Justice Ministry said that an investigation into the incident had found that the officers involved had acted in accordance with the law and their training.

""The investigation found that the use of lethal force in this case was necessary to prevent an immediate and real threat to the lives of civilians and police officers,"" the statement read.

The decision to absolve the officers of any responsibility in the killing of al-Hallaq has been met with criticism from Palestinian officials and human rights groups, who have accused Israeli security forces of using excessive force against Palestinians, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

""We strongly condemn this decision, which sends a message that Israeli security forces can act with impunity, even when they kill innocent civilians,"" said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch.

The Israeli government has defended the actions of its security forces, arguing that they are necessary to protect Israeli citizens from Palestinian attacks and terrorism.

The killing of al-Hallaq was one of several high-profile incidents in recent years that have raised concerns about the treatment of Palestinians by Israeli security forces. In 2018, a video showing an Israeli soldier shooting a Palestinian man in the back as he ran away sparked outrage across the region and led to calls for greater accountability for Israeli security forces.

Despite these concerns, however, the Israeli government has continued to defend its use of force against Palestinians, arguing that it is necessary to maintain security in the face of ongoing threats.

""The use of force by Israeli security forces is always subject to strict legal and ethical guidelines, and we will continue to take all necessary measures to protect Israeli citizens from terrorist attacks,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement.

The decision to absolve the Israeli police officers involved in the killing of al-Hallaq is likely to exacerbate tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza.

As the conflict continues to spiral out of control, with Israel launching airstrikes on Gaza in response to Hamas rocket attacks, there are fears that the situation could escalate further, leading to further violence and bloodshed.

Despite these concerns, however, there are those who argue that a resolution to the conflict is possible, and that both sides must work together to find a peaceful solution to the ongoing violence.

""We believe that the only way to end this tragic cycle of violence is through dialogue and negotiation, and that both Israelis and Palestinians have a responsibility to work towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict,"" said Shakir.

As tensions continue to simmer in the region, however, it remains to be seen whether the Israeli government will be willing to engage in meaningful dialogue with Palestinian leaders and work towards a peaceful resolution to the ongoing conflict.",1
57,States confront medical debt that's bankrupting millions,"Millions of Americans are facing the crushing burden of medical debt – a staggering problem that is bankrupting individuals and wreaking havoc on the national economy.

States across the country are confronting the issue, grappling with how to help citizens who are drowning in medical bills and struggling to navigate an opaque and often unforgiving healthcare system.

In New York, lawmakers are considering a proposal to create a state-run insurance program that would cover residents who can't get coverage through their employer or the Affordable Care Act. The so-called New York Health Act would guarantee comprehensive coverage to everyone in the state, a move that advocates say could drastically reduce medical debt and improve access to care.

""Medical debt is a big reason why so many New Yorkers struggle to make ends meet,"" said Senator Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat who is sponsoring the legislation. ""We need a healthcare system that puts people before profits and doesn't leave anyone behind.""

Nearly one in three Americans have medical debt, according to a 2019 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average amount owed is $2,000, but some people face bills that run into the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.

For many, medical debt is an unexpected and sudden expense that they can't afford to pay off. Others are forced to choose between paying for healthcare or other essentials like rent and food.

The problem is particularly acute for people of color and low-income Americans, who are more likely to lack health insurance and face systemic barriers to accessing care.

Medical debt can quickly spiral out of control, with bills from multiple providers and unexpected charges for things like ambulance rides and hospital stays. And unlike other forms of debt, medical bills often come with little warning and no clear explanation of the cost.

""The system is set up so that people are confused and overwhelmed,"" said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York. ""You have to be a healthcare policy expert to understand what you're being charged for and why.""

Some states are taking steps to address the problem. California recently passed a law that limits what hospitals can charge uninsured patients, while Colorado implemented a program that allows patients to appeal medical bills and negotiate payment plans.

But advocates say more needs to be done, particularly at the federal level. Bills introduced in Congress would expand Medicaid coverage, strengthen consumer protections against surprise medical bills, and cap out-of-pocket expenses for patients.

""The federal government needs to step up and make healthcare a right, not a privilege,"" said Rosemary Enobakhare, an organizer with the Healthcare is a Human Right Campaign in Maryland.

The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the issue, with millions of Americans losing their jobs and health insurance in the past year. Even those who have coverage may face unexpected bills for COVID-related care or have to pay out-of-pocket for treatments that aren't covered by their insurance.

""I had to go to the hospital for COVID and was there for four days,"" said Lisa Hall, a single mother in Michigan. ""I thought I was covered, but then I got a bill for over $30,000. I don't know how I'm supposed to pay that.""

Hall's story isn't unique. Across the country, families are struggling to make ends meet as they cope with the financial fallout of the pandemic. Experts warn that without swift action, medical debt could become a leading cause of bankruptcy and financial strain in the coming years.

""I worry about people who have to choose between putting food on the table and paying for medical care,"" said Angela Cornelius, a community health worker in North Carolina. ""It's not fair, and it's not sustainable.""

For people like Cornelius, the solution is clear: a healthcare system that prioritizes affordability and accessibility for all.

""We need to create a system that doesn't leave anyone behind,"" she said. ""We're all in this together, and we need to work together to make healthcare a human right.""",1
58,New images from inside Fukushima reactor spark safety worry,"Tokyo, Japan - New images from inside the Fukushima nuclear reactor have sparked safety concerns and raised questions about the ongoing cleanup effort nearly a decade after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck the region.

The images were captured by a remotely-operated robot, which was sent into the reactor's primary containment vessel by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the plant's operator. The robot captured footage of a mysterious black substance that could potentially be melted nuclear fuel debris.

The substance was found near the base of the reactor on the floor of the primary containment vessel. It is believed to be a mixture of melted nuclear fuel debris, metal and structural materials that were damaged during the meltdown. The substance is highly radioactive and could pose significant risks to workers tasked with removing it.

The discovery of the black substance is a significant development in the ongoing efforts to decommission the Fukushima nuclear plant. The plant suffered a triple meltdown in March 2011 after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the region.

The disaster resulted in the release of large amounts of radiation into the surrounding environment. The Fukushima disaster is the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.

Since then, TEPCO has been working to remove the melted fuel debris from the reactors. The company has faced many challenges in the cleanup effort, including high levels of radiation, environmental concerns, and technical difficulties.

The discovery of the black substance has raised new safety concerns and renewed calls for more transparency in the cleanup effort. There are concerns that the cleanup effort is not progressing as quickly as it should and that there may be more hidden dangers lurking within the reactor.

Researchers have been working on developing new technologies to improve the cleanup effort, including a robot that can swim through pools of radioactive water and identify hazardous materials. However, the discovery of the black substance is a reminder that cleaning up after a nuclear disaster is a difficult and dangerous task.

The discovery of the black substance has also raised questions about the long-term safety of nuclear power. Despite improvements in safety measures, nuclear power plants still pose significant risks to the environment and public health.

The Fukushima disaster was a wakeup call for the world and led to a reevaluation of nuclear power as a viable energy source. Governments and energy companies have been investing in alternative energy sources like wind and solar power.

“Nuclear power should be phased out globally,” said Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace. “It's too dangerous, too expensive and too dirty.”

However, other experts argue that nuclear power is still necessary to meet the growing demand for energy around the world.

“Nuclear power is an essential energy source in the fight against climate change,” said Tom Klinger, a nuclear energy expert. “Renewable energy sources like wind and solar cannot produce the same amount of reliable and affordable energy as nuclear power.”

The Fukushima disaster was a tragedy that has left a lasting impact on Japan and the world. The discovery of the black substance is a reminder that the cleanup effort is far from over and that there are still risks associated with nuclear power.

The images captured by the robot are a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk inside the Fukushima nuclear reactor. The discovery of the black substance should serve as a wake-up call for the world that nuclear power should be approached with caution and that alternative energy sources should be explored to meet the growing demand for energy.",1
59,Iowa man pleads guilty in Arizona election threats case,"An Iowa man has pleaded guilty to a federal charge of sending threatening messages to election officials in Arizona. According to court documents, 27-year-old Jeremie Ryan of Waterloo, Iowa, used a fake email address to send a series of threatening messages to Arizona officials in November 2020, following the presidential election.

In one of the emails, Ryan threatened to blow up a Maricopa County building if election officials did not ""stop the counting"" of ballots. FBI agents traced the messages back to Ryan's IP address in Iowa and arrested him in December 2020.

During his plea hearing on Wednesday, Ryan admitted to sending the threatening messages and acknowledged that his actions caused fear among election officials and workers.

""This defendant's actions were not only criminal, but they threatened the integrity of our democratic process,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Glenn McCormick in a statement. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to investigate and prosecute those who seek to intimidate or threaten election officials.""

Ryan is scheduled to be sentenced in August and faces up to five years in prison.",1
60,Arkansas House OKs social media age verification requirement,"The Arkansas House of Representatives has approved a bill requiring social media companies to verify the age of their users. The legislation, which passed with a 79-5 vote, seeks to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content online.

The bill's sponsor, Republican Representative Jon Eubanks, believes that social media companies are not doing enough to ensure that their users are of legal age. ""We need to put the burden on the companies that produce these sites to try to prevent minors from accessing them,"" Eubanks said.

Under the proposed law, social media companies would be required to use a ""reliable mechanism"" to verify the age of their users. This could include asking users to provide a valid government ID or using other methods such as facial recognition technology.

The legislation would also require social media companies to provide an opt-out option for parents who don't want their children's data to be collected or shared.

Supporters of the bill say that it's necessary to protect children from harmful online content. ""We need to do everything we can to ensure that our children are safe when they use these platforms,"" said Democratic Representative Tippi McCullough.

Opponents of the bill argue that it would be difficult for social media companies to comply with the age verification requirement, and that it could lead to privacy violations. ""This bill could have unintended consequences that could harm the very people it's trying to protect,"" said Democratic Representative Andrew Collins.

Social media companies have not yet commented on the legislation. However, they have previously expressed concerns about similar proposals in other states. Last year, Facebook and Google both lobbied against a bill in Vermont that would have required social media companies to verify user ages.

The Arkansas bill now moves to the Senate for consideration. If it passes there, it will be sent to Governor Asa Hutchinson for his signature.

Many other states have also introduced bills to regulate social media. Last year, California passed a law requiring social media companies to disclose how they collect and use user data. New York is considering a bill that would require social media companies to remove posts that contain false information about vaccines.

Overall, the issue of regulating social media is a contentious one, with advocates on both sides of the debate. While some believe that social media companies should be held responsible for ensuring that their platforms are safe for users of all ages, others argue that government intervention could lead to censorship and infringe on free speech rights.",1
61,New Kansas law will reduce blinking lights on wind turbines,"Wind turbines are a necessary part of renewable energy, but they can also cause a headache for nearby residents. The incessant blinking lights that warn pilots of their presence can be a disturbance to those living in the area. However, a new Kansas law hopes to change that.

On Monday, Governor Laura Kelly signed a bill that will reduce the number of blinking lights on wind turbines across the state. Under the new law, turbines that are less than 200 feet tall or located in rural areas will be exempt from having blinking lights. This means that thousands of turbines across Kansas will no longer be required to have blinking lights.

The law is expected to save wind farm operators millions of dollars in maintenance costs as blinking lights frequently need to be replaced. Additionally, it will reduce the impact on the environment by decreasing light pollution and the number of birds and bats that get disoriented by the lights. 

The new law has received praise from both environmentalists and business groups. Some, however, worry about the safety implications of reducing the number of blinking lights. Nevertheless, Kansas has taken a step towards finding a balance between renewable energy and sustainability.",1
62,"Devils beat Capitals in OT, will face Rangers in 1st round","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey Devils secured their spot in the Stanley Cup playoffs with a thrilling overtime victory against the Washington Capitals on Saturday night.

Kyle Palmieri scored the game-winner just minutes into overtime, sending the Devils into a frenzy and securing their spot to face the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs.

The Devils were facing a tough matchup against the Capitals, who were looking to secure the top seed in the Eastern Conference. But the Devils came out strong, with Nico Hischier scoring early in the first period to give them an early lead.

The Capitals quickly responded with goals from T.J. Oshie and Evgeny Kuznetsov to take the lead. In the second period, the Devils tied it up with a goal from Miles Wood, but the Capitals regained the lead with a goal from Brett Connolly.

Trailing 3-2 in the third period, the Devils pulled their goaltender and Jesper Bratt tied the game with just over two minutes left in regulation to force overtime.

In the extra period, Palmieri got the puck on a breakaway and beat Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby to secure the win for the Devils.

""We never quit, we kept fighting and found a way to win,"" Palmieri said after the game. ""We're excited to be in the playoffs and we're looking forward to the challenge ahead.""

63,5 will be lined up in night sky this week,"Sky watchers and stargazers are in for a treat this week as five planets will be lining up in the night sky. Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars will all be visible to the naked eye from February 10th to February 20th.

The alignment of the five planets is a relatively rare phenomenon that occurs approximately once every 20 years. The last time it occurred was in 2005 and the next one won't be until 2040. The alignment is caused by the orbits of each planet relative to the Earth, with each planet appearing to line up in a diagonal pattern across the sky.

The planets will be visible in the pre-dawn hours, with the best viewing time being around 6:30 a.m. local time. Stargazers can look towards the southeastern horizon to view the planetary lineup.

Mercury, the smallest and innermost planet, will be the hardest to spot due to its proximity to the sun. Venus, the brightest planet in our solar system, will be the easiest to spot, shining like a bright star in the sky. Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars will be visible as well, with Mars appearing as a fiery-red dot.

A telescope or binoculars can enhance the viewing experience, allowing viewers to see more detail on each planet. It's exciting to see all the planets lined up in the night sky, and even more so considering it won't happen again for another two decades.

So grab your warm jackets, binoculars, and telescopes, and enjoy the unique astronomical event that will be taking place in the night sky this week. Don't forget to catch it early, as the celestial show won't last long.",1
64,"Bob Lee, Cash App founder, fatally stabbed in San Francisco","SAN FRANCISCO - The tech industry has lost one of its brightest minds as Bob Lee, co-founder of Cash App, was fatally stabbed outside of his San Francisco home on Monday evening. Lee's contributions to the payment sector have been significant, and his death is seen as a major loss to the industry as a whole.

According to reports, Lee was confronted by an unknown assailant, who then proceeded to stab him multiple times before fleeing the scene. Lee was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.

Lee's death has sent shockwaves through the industry, with many expressing their condolences and sympathy to his family and colleagues. ""Bob Lee was one of the most brilliant minds in the tech industry,"" said Chris Sacca, a prominent venture capitalist and early investor in Cash App. ""He will be deeply missed, and his legacy will continue to inspire us for many years to come.""

Cash App, which was founded in 2013 and is now used by millions of people worldwide, has become one of the most popular payment apps on the market. With its simple, user-friendly interface and fast transaction times, Cash App has revolutionized the way people send and receive money online.

Lee, who co-founded the company alongside Jack Dorsey, was instrumental in Cash App's early success. His keen insights into user behavior and his ability to respond to the changing needs of the market were critical in helping the company grow rapidly in its early years.

""Bob was an innovator, a leader, and a friend to all of us at Cash App,"" said Dorsey in a statement released following Lee's death. ""His impact on our company and on the world of payments will never be forgotten.""

Lee's death comes at a time when violence in San Francisco has been on the rise. The city has seen a surge in violent crime in recent years, with homicides increasing by more than 30 percent in 2021 alone.

Many are calling for action to be taken to address the issue, with some pointing to the city's homelessness crisis as a root cause. Homelessness has long been a problem in San Francisco, and observers say that it has contributed to rising crime rates in the area.

Others are calling for greater resources to be devoted to mental health services, as many of the perpetrators of violent crimes are dealing with serious mental health issues.

65,Nebraska trans care ban for minors advances -- with a twist,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska lawmakers have advanced a bill that would ban transgender minors from receiving gender-affirming medical care. However, the measure also includes a surprising twist which has garnered attention from LGBTQ advocates around the country.

The bill, known as LB-505, passed its first-round vote in the state Legislature on Tuesday. It would prohibit doctors from performing any surgeries, prescribing hormone therapy or providing any other medical treatments aimed at helping minors with gender dysphoria transition to their affirmed gender.

The bill's author, Republican Senator Megan Hunt, argues that gender-affirming medical care is dangerous and that minors are not mature enough to make such decisions.

""Children and teenagers are not mature enough to understand the full impact of these irreversible medical procedures,"" she said. ""The long-term consequences of these procedures are not fully understood, and the risk of regret later in life is too great.""

However, Hunt's bill includes a unique provision which has not been seen in other states' trans care bans. Under LB-505, transgender minors would not be punished for seeking out gender-affirming care. Instead, doctors who perform gender-affirming procedures on minors would face a civil penalty of up to $25,000.

This ""penalty-only"" approach has drawn praise from LGBTQ activists who have been pushing back against a wave of state-level trans care bans in recent years. Instead of criminalizing transgender youth, Hunt's bill would only hold doctors accountable for providing medical care that goes against the state's laws.

""We commend Senator Hunt for taking a different approach to trans care bans,"" said Amit Paley, CEO and Executive Director of The Trevor Project, a national organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ youth. ""It's a step in the right direction for protecting the health and well-being of transgender young people.""

However, not everyone is convinced by the argument that transgender youth should not be allowed to receive gender-affirming medical care. Several medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, have called for access to such care for transgender minors.

""Gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapy and gender confirmation surgery, has been shown to improve mental health outcomes for transgender individuals,"" said Erica Greenfield, a pediatrician and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. ""It is essential that these treatments are provided in a safe and supportive environment, with the guidance of medical professionals who understand the unique needs of transgender youth.""

The proposed ban on trans care for minors has also faced opposition from the transgender community and its allies in Nebraska. At a public hearing on the bill in March, several transgender youth testified about the positive impact that gender-affirming care has had on their lives.

""I have been on hormone therapy for almost a year now, and I can already see the changes I need to be happy and comfortable in my body,"" said Levi, a 16-year-old transgender boy. ""If this ban passes, it would take away my access to medical care that I need to survive and thrive.""

Despite the opposition, the bill is likely to face an uphill battle in passing the Legislature. Nebraskans for Founders Values Action, a conservative advocacy group, has already announced its support for the bill and plans to lobby lawmakers to vote in favor.

""Gender-affirming medical care is not a 'right' for minors,"" said Karen Bowling, Executive Director of Nebraskans for Founders Values Action. ""It is simply not safe or wise to allow minors to make such life-altering decisions before they have the maturity and life experience to fully understand the consequences.""

The bill is set to go through several more rounds of debate and voting in the Legislature before it can become law. If it does pass, Nebraska would join a growing number of states that have imposed trans care bans in recent years. However, the penalty-only approach included in LB-505 is a unique twist that will be closely watched by activists and lawmakers around the country.",1
66,Uncrewed Russian spacecraft that leaked coolant lands safely,"An uncrewed Russian spacecraft has successfully returned to Earth after a mission to send supplies to the International Space Station. The Progress MS-14 spacecraft landed safely in Kazakhstan early on Wednesday, after completing its delivery mission.

The spacecraft had a minor issue during its approach to the International Space Station, during which it leaked some coolant. However, despite the issue, the spacecraft carried out its delivery mission without any further hitches.

The Progress MS-14 spacecraft was carrying more than 2.5 tonnes of supplies, including food, fuel, and equipment for the crew on board the International Space Station. According to the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, the spacecraft's return to Earth was automatically controlled without any involvement from the ground control center.

This latest delivery mission is part of Russia's ongoing efforts to support the International Space Station. The country has been sending unmanned spacecraft to the space station for more than 20 years, and its crewed missions have also been crucial to the station's operation.

The success of this latest mission is good news for the Russian space program, which has had its share of setbacks in recent years. Last year, a crewed mission to the International Space Station was aborted after a Soyuz rocket failed mid-flight. However, this landing proves that Russia's uncrewed missions remain reliable and effective.

Overall, the successful landing of the Progress MS-14 spacecraft is a testament to the expertise and resilience of the Russian space program. With plans for more deliveries and manned missions in the future, Russia's contributions to the International Space Station continue to play a vital role in the ongoing exploration of space.",1
67,Thailand hopes for major splash in tourism during Songkran,"Thailand is preparing for its largest annual festival, Songkran, which is set to take place on April 13-15. The popular event, also known as the Thai New Year, is traditionally celebrated by water splashing, which signifies the cleansing of bad luck and misfortunes from the past year. 

As Thailand’s tourism industry slowly recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the government is hoping for a major splash in the number of visitors during the Songkran festival. Last year’s event was canceled due to the pandemic, but this year’s celebrations will still follow local health and safety guidelines to ensure the safety of visitors.

Tourism Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said in a recent statement that he expects over one million domestic tourists to travel within the country during the festival, generating around $65 million in revenue. The government has also launched a campaign called “Songkran Splashing: Happiness Returns to Thailand,” to promote local tourism and encourage people to travel within the country during the festival.

Thailand has already introduced a travel bubble program, allowing tourists from low-risk countries to visit certain Thai provinces without having to quarantine upon arrival. The program has been launched in provinces such as Phuket, Krabi, and Koh Samui, which are popular tourist destinations. These measures are part of Thailand’s efforts to revive its tourism industry, which has been severely hit by the pandemic.

Many hotels and resorts in Thailand are offering special Songkran promotions and packages to attract both domestic and foreign tourists. Popular tourist destinations such as Chiang Mai and Bangkok are also preparing for the festival by organizing traditional religious ceremonies, cultural performances, and water splashing activities.

Despite the optimism, some experts have expressed concerns about the potential risks of organizing such large-scale events during the pandemic. The government has assured the public that strict health and safety guidelines will be in place, and that visitors and organizers will be required to observe social distancing measures and wear masks at all times.

Thailand has reported a total of 29,905 COVID-19 cases and 95 deaths, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization. The government is actively vaccinating its population to achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of the virus.

Overall, tourism officials and industry professionals are hopeful that Songkran will be a success and help accelerate the recovery of Thailand’s tourism industry.",1
68,Natalie Merchant emerges from darkness with nothing but love,"Natalie Merchant emerges from darkness with nothing but love

Natalie Merchant is a name that resonates with music lovers all over the world. From fronting alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs to her successful post-Maniacs solo career, Merchant has been a prominent fixture in the music industry since the 1980s. However, her life has not been without struggles, with a tough upbringing and personal tragedy marking her journey. Despite this darkness, Merchant has found solace in creating music that speaks from her heart.

Born in Jamestown, New York in 1963, Merchant's childhood was marked by poverty and familial issues. She was raised by her grandmother and mother, who struggled financially and emotionally. Merchant's mother suffered from bipolar disorder, and Merchant herself struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In a 2014 interview with NPR, Merchant spoke candidly about her upbringing and its impact on her later life.

""I think my upbringing in many ways has informed everything that I've done, the things that I've been drawn to artistically,"" Merchant said. ""And it's certainly given me empathy for people and a desire to communicate and to express myself in a way that is relatable.""

Merchant joined 10,000 Maniacs at the age of 17, becoming the band's lead vocalist. The band's blend of alternative rock, folk and pop proved to be a hit, with their second album, ""In My Tribe,"" achieving platinum status. However, after a decade of success, Merchant left the band in 1993 to pursue a solo career.

Her solo career was marked by success, with her debut album ""Tigerlily"" achieving triple platinum status. Despite this, Merchant grappled with personal struggles in the years that followed. She suffered a miscarriage in 1998, and in 2003, her mother took her own life. Merchant's grief over her mother's death led her to take a hiatus from music.

""I stopped writing, stopped playing guitar,"" Merchant said in a 2014 interview with NPR. ""I was really out of touch with any kind of creativity. I just needed to process this immense loss.""

It wasn't until 2014 that Merchant returned to the studio, releasing her self-titled album. The album was a departure from her earlier work, featuring stripped-down, acoustic arrangements that highlighted Merchant's voice and lyrical prowess. As she told Billboard in 2014, the album was inspired by her newfound appreciation for the simple things in life.

""I just keep coming back to how much more poignant ordinary things are to me now,"" Merchant said. ""Being in a place where you can appreciate the smallest things in life is a real gift.""

Merchant's latest album, ""Butterfly,"" was released in July 2021, and like her self-titled album, features stripped-down arrangements that place emphasis on Merchant's voice and lyrics. The album was largely recorded in 2020 in Merchant's home studio, with Merchant playing most of the instruments herself.

Despite the challenges of recording during a pandemic, Merchant found the experience to be cathartic.

""The process of making this album was kind of a refuge for me,"" Merchant said in a recent interview with Rolling Stone. ""It was something that I could do where I didn't have to worry about the world outside.""

The album's first single, ""Motherland,"" is a poignant reflection on the immigrant experience in America. Merchant, whose maternal grandparents were immigrants, said the song was inspired by the current political climate in the US.

""It's a feeling that I have that there's been this gradual erosion of what this country was founded on, the ideals of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,"" Merchant said in the Rolling Stone interview. ""It's become more us-versus-them, more divisive, more polarized. And I feel that's really unfair to the immigrants who've come here and built this country, and who are still coming here.""

Another standout track on the album is ""End,"" a haunting meditation on mortality. Merchant said in the album's press release that the song was inspired by her mother's suicide.

""I was thinking about how we never talk about death,"" Merchant said. ""In this culture, we're always trying to put it off, like it's never going to happen to us. I was thinking about how my mother never talked about it, and how it was a taboo subject, and how it almost seemed like she felt guilty for dying.""

Despite the darkness that has marked her life, Merchant's music is infused with hope and love. She said in the Rolling Stone interview that her latest album is a reflection of where she is in her life and what she wants to communicate.

""I'm in my fifties now, and I feel like I have a better perspective on what really matters in life,"" she said. ""And it's really just love, you know? Love of self, love of others, love of community, love of the planet. That's what gets us through the hard times.""

Merchant said she hopes her latest album will resonate with listeners in the same way that her earlier work has.

""I'm not trying to reinvent anything,"" Merchant said. ""I'm just trying to make music that feels right to me, and that hopefully other people will connect with.""",1
69,Gardening help in the palm of your hand,"Are you tired of spending hours researching the perfect plant for your garden, only to have it die a few weeks later? Fear not, gardening assistance is now available in the palm of your hand.

With the rise of technology, it has become easier than ever to learn about gardening and keep your plants thriving. From mobile apps to online forums, there is a wealth of knowledge available to even the most novice gardener.

One popular app is called My Garden by Gardena. This app allows users to plan out their garden by selecting plants from a database and organizing them in a virtual garden bed. The app also provides information on how to care for each plant, including the best time to water and how much sun exposure is needed.

Another app, called Gardenate, takes a more personalized approach by providing information based on the user's location and climate. When first opening the app, users are prompted to enter their location and postal code. From there, the app provides recommendations on what to plant based on the current season and climate.

Gardeners can also turn to online forums for advice and support. One popular forum, called GardenWeb, has been around since 1995 and boasts over 7 million posts from gardening enthusiasts. Users can ask questions and receive advice from experts and fellow hobbyists.

In addition to technology, there has been a renewed interest in gardening as more people prioritize sustainability and self-sufficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to an increase in at-home gardening as people look for ways to stay busy and connect with nature.

According to a survey conducted by Garden Research, 86% of households participated in some form of gardening in 2020, a significant increase from the 78% in 2016. Within that group, 20% were first-time gardeners.

Despite the growing interest, many people still struggle with keeping their plants alive. Some common mistakes include overwatering, under-watering, choosing the wrong soil, and incorrect placement in terms of sunlight.

This is where technology can provide some assistance. Plant sensors, such as the Parrot Flower Power, can be placed in the soil to monitor moisture levels, temperature, and light exposure. Users can then receive notifications on their smartphone when the plant needs water or sunlight.

Another useful tool is the SmartPlant app. Users can take a photo of their plant and submit it to the app, which then identifies the plant and provides information on how to care for it. Users can also chat with horticulturists for personalized advice.

The rise of technology in gardening has also sparked new innovations in agriculture. Vertical farming, which involves growing plants in stacked layers using artificial light, has become increasingly popular in urban areas where space is limited.

Companies such as AeroFarms and Plenty use this method to grow crops such as leafy greens and herbs in a controlled environment. This reduces the need for pesticides and herbicides, and significantly reduces the carbon footprint of transportation.

While technology can provide valuable assistance in gardening, experts still urge gardeners to also rely on their own instincts and observations. No app or sensor can replace the knowledge gained through hands-on experience.

As Claudia West, ecological sales manager at North Creek Nurseries, told The Washington Post, ""The most important tool for a gardener is not his or her trowel, but rather the ability to identify what is happening in the landscape and respond accordingly.""

In addition to providing assistance, gardening has been shown to have numerous benefits for mental and physical well-being. Gardening can reduce stress, increase concentration, and lower blood pressure. It also provides an opportunity for physical activity and fresh air.

In conclusion, gardening no longer needs to be a frustrating and overwhelming experience. With the help of technology, it has become easier than ever to plan, care for, and enjoy a thriving garden. Whether you are a seasoned gardener or just starting out, there is a wealth of knowledge available in the palm of your hand.",1
70,Missouri tornado kills 5 in latest wave of severe weather,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — A powerful tornado tore through Missouri late Wednesday, killing at least five people and injuring dozens, after a blitz of twisters pounded the Midwest earlier in the week, bringing the death toll to nine.

The latest wave of severe weather hit the state capital of Jefferson City just before midnight, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Homes and businesses were leveled, cars were overturned, and tree branches littered the streets.

""We're still in the search and rescue phase,"" Gov. Mike Parson told reporters Thursday morning. ""We have a lot of work to do to get through this. But we will recover. Missourians are resilient.""

The five fatalities were confirmed by officials at a news conference Thursday afternoon. Among the dead were three people who were killed in a car that was overturned in Jefferson City. The other two were killed in the nearby town of Eldon when their home was destroyed by the twister.

At least 30 people were injured in the storm, according to Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. John Lueckenhoff. Three individuals were in critical condition.

The tornado was the latest in a series of deadly storms that have swept through the Midwest since Monday, prompting multiple tornado warnings and watches across the region.

Earlier this week, a tornado in Ohio killed one person and injured several others. Another twister in Indiana killed two people and injured many more. On Wednesday morning, a tornado in Iowa killed one person and injured several others.

The storms have also caused widespread damage and power outages, with thousands of people still without electricity in some areas.

The National Weather Service said the tornado that hit Jefferson City was an EF-3, with winds hitting up to 160 mph. The tornado touched down about six miles southwest of the capital before sweeping through town.

""It's hard to believe that nobody was killed in that area,"" Parson said, referring to the neighborhood that was hardest hit. ""It's a miracle that more lives weren't lost.""

Photos and video footage shared on social media showed the scale of the destruction, with homes and businesses reduced to rubble and emergency responders carrying people to safety.

Missouri's governor declared a state of emergency shortly after the tornado hit, allowing state resources to be deployed to affected areas. President Donald Trump also offered his condolences on Twitter and said he had asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist in the recovery effort.

""We're with you all the way,"" Trump tweeted. ""God bless you.""

The tornado prompted a temporary curfew in Jefferson City and closed schools in the capital on Thursday. Missouri officials said they were working to secure the affected areas and assess the damage.

Friday is expected to be another severe weather day in the region, with forecasters warning of dangerous storms, tornadoes, and flooding.

""We want people to be prepared,"" Parson said. ""It's going to be a difficult time, but we're going to pull through this together.""

The latest wave of tornadoes has brought the total number of twisters in the US this year to more than 500, according to the National Weather Service. That's nearly double the number reported at this time last year.

Climate scientists say that extreme weather events such as tornadoes are becoming more frequent and severe due to the human-caused climate crisis, which is causing the planet to warm and disrupting weather patterns.

The Trump administration has rolled back many of the environmental regulations put in place by previous administrations to address climate change, including rules on carbon emissions from power plants and vehicles.

Meanwhile, residents of Jefferson City and other affected areas are facing a long road to recovery.

""It's devastating,"" said Chris Connell, who lives in the city. ""You feel helpless when something like this happens. But we'll come back from it. We always do.""",1
71,Virginia lawmakers to weigh Youngkin's changes to hemp bill,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia lawmakers are set to debate and vote on changes introduced by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to a hemp bill passed by the state legislature last session that would expand the state's hemp industry.

Youngkin's proposed amendments to the bill include eliminating the cap on the number of hemp processors permitted in the state and removing a requirement that growers must have a buyer for their crop prior to receiving a license. Additionally, the governor has proposed changing the way hemp products are tested for their THC content.

While the proposed changes have been met with pushback from some Democrats who argue that they could lead to a proliferation of low-quality or even illegal hemp products, others have praised Youngkin's efforts as a way to boost the state's economy and expand opportunities for farmers.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Youngkin said he believes the hemp industry has the potential to create new jobs and provide Virginia farmers with a lucrative cash crop.

""We have to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support our farmers, and one way we can do that is by expanding the hemp industry,"" Youngkin said. ""This is an opportunity for Virginia to be a leader in this space and to really capitalize on this growing market.""

Under current Virginia law, the state is limited to licensing just five hemp processors, a restriction that some have argued has impeded the growth of the industry. Youngkin's proposed amendment would remove this cap altogether, potentially allowing for the licensing of an unlimited number of processors.

Critics say this could lead to a flood of low-quality or even illegal hemp products flooding the market, since there would be no way to regulate the quality of the products produced by these new processors.

Democratic state Senator Jennifer McClellan, a longtime advocate for legalizing marijuana in Virginia, said she is concerned that the governor's proposal could potentially ""open the floodgates"" to a range of low-quality hemp products.

""There are significant concerns that we could see products entering the market that have not been properly tested or verified for their quality or efficacy,"" McClellan said.

Youngkin, however, argued that the state already has a system in place for regulating and testing hemp products, and that his proposal would simply update and modernize that system to account for changes in the industry.

""We're not just throwing open the doors and letting anyone who wants to produce hemp do it,"" he said. ""We're still going to have a rigorous system of testing and regulation to ensure that only high-quality, safe products make it to market.""

Another proposed change by Youngkin would remove a requirement that hemp growers have to secure a buyer for their crop prior to being granted a license to grow. This would make it easier for farmers to enter the industry, but some worry that without a guaranteed buyer, growers could struggle to find a market for their crop.

""I think it's a little concerning that we're essentially telling farmers to 'build it and they will come', without any real assurance that they'll be able to sell their crop,"" McClellan said.

Youngkin has said that removing this requirement would simply allow farmers to get a foothold in the industry without having to worry about the difficulties of securing a buyer prior to planting.

Finally, Youngkin's proposed changes to the hemp bill would involve revamping the way in which hemp products are tested for their THC content. Under current law, products must be tested in a lab certified by the Virginia Department of Forensic Science, which some have argued is an outdated approach.

Youngkin's proposal would allow for alternative testing methods to be used, including those developed by private labs or other states. Some have argued that this could lead to a more diverse and innovative testing landscape, while others worry that it would lead to an uneven and potentially unsafe regulatory environment.

Ultimately, the fate of Youngkin's proposed changes to the hemp bill will be decided by the General Assembly, which is set to reconvene in January. Regardless of the outcome, the debate over the future of Virginia's hemp industry is sure to continue, as advocates and critics clash over how best to regulate this burgeoning market.",1
72,"Amazon worker injuries dip last year, but higher than 2020","SEATTLE (AP) — The number of Amazon workers injured on the job dipped last year, but was still higher than in 2020, according to data released this week by the retail giant.

Amazon reported 8.9 injuries per 100 full-time employees in 2021, down from 10.6 injuries per 100 employees in 2020.

The company has come under scrutiny for its workplace safety practices, with some employees and labor advocates alleging that Amazon prioritizes efficiency over worker safety.

In response to the criticism, Amazon has said that it invests heavily in safety measures and training for its employees. The company has also hired more than 6,200 safety professionals and invested more than $1 billion in safety initiatives since 2015.

“We’re proud of the progress we’ve made in reducing injuries, but we know we still have work to do,” Amazon said in a statement.

Amazon said that the most common types of injuries reported by employees are musculoskeletal disorders, such as sprains and strains, and ergonomic injuries, which are often caused by repetitive motion.

“Most workplace injuries are preventable, with the right training, equipment, and processes in place,” Amazon said.

The company said that it has implemented a number of measures aimed at reducing the risk of worker injuries, such as providing ergonomically designed workstations, offering stretching and exercise programs, and using robotics and automation to reduce the physical demands of certain jobs.

According to the data released by Amazon, the company’s fulfillment centers had the highest injury rates, with 9.6 injuries per 100 employees. The company’s delivery stations had the second-highest injury rate, at 6.9 injuries per 100 employees.

Amazon has faced criticism and legal action over workplace safety issues in the past. In 2018, the company was fined $28,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for failing to provide adequate safeguards for workers at a New Hampshire fulfillment center.

Last year, the company faced lawsuits from employees who claimed they were not provided with adequate protective gear or training during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, Amazon said that its injury rates are lower than those of the warehousing and storage industry as a whole, which had an injury rate of 13.5 injuries per 100 employees in 2019, according to OSHA data.",1

74,MLB teams extend beer sales after pitch clock shortens games,"As the 2021 Major League Baseball season approaches, fans may notice an increase in the availability of beer at ballparks across the country. A recent decision by several MLB teams to extend beer sales throughout the game follows the implementation of a pitch clock aimed at shortening game times.

The pitch clock, which will be enforced in all levels of minor league baseball this season, requires pitchers to deliver a pitch within a specified time limit. It is part of a broader effort by MLB to speed up the pace of games and appeal to younger fans with shorter attention spans.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has praised the pitch clock as a ""significant step forward,"" and hopes it will help keep games within a reasonable timeframe.

But while some fans may welcome the speedier pace, others worry that it could detract from the overall entertainment value of the game. To address these concerns, several MLB teams have opted to extend beer sales throughout the game, rather than simply cutting them off after the seventh inning stretch.

""For a lot of fans, beer is an integral part of the ballpark experience,"" says Tom Werner, owner of the Boston Red Sox. ""By extending beer sales, we hope to provide a more relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for those who may feel rushed by the pitch clock.""

Other teams, including the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees, have followed suit, citing similar concerns. The Cubs, in particular, have made efforts to enhance the overall fan experience at Wrigley Field, including the addition of new food and drink options, live music, and other entertainment.

While the decision to extend beer sales is primarily aimed at improving fan experience, it could also have financial benefits for the teams themselves. According to a recent study by Nielsen Sports, beer accounts for approximately 40% of all stadium concessions revenue.

This means that extending beer sales could generate a significant increase in revenue for teams, especially if it attracts more fans to the ballpark who are interested in taking advantage of the offer.

Not everyone is convinced, however, that extending beer sales is a wise move. Some argue that the risks of overconsumption and fan violence are already high during baseball games, and extending sales could exacerbate these issues.

""Baseball games are already a hotbed of alcohol-related issues,"" says Jack R. Stone, a professor of criminology at USC. ""Opening up beer sales even more could lead to more fights, more drunk driving, and more crime.""

Despite these concerns, the trend towards extended beer sales is likely to continue as MLB continues its efforts to modernize the game and cater to changing fan demands.

As fans prepare for the start of the 2021 MLB season, they can expect faster-paced games, more entertainment options, and perhaps a few more cold ones to help them enjoy the experience. Whether or not these changes will ultimately succeed in appealing to a younger and more diverse fanbase remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain - the game of baseball is evolving, and fans will need to adapt along with it.",1
75,"Tesla cuts prices on all models, 3rd cut this year","Tesla, the electric car company, has announced a price cut on all of its models for the third time this year. The move, which comes amid rising competition and concerns over demand for electric vehicles, signals the company's determination to maintain its market position.

The Model 3, Tesla's most affordable vehicle, will see its starting price drop by $1,000 to $38,190. Prices for the Model S and Model X will also be reduced by $2,000 and $5,000, respectively. This latest round of price cuts follows similar reductions on all models in late February and early May.

Tesla's decision to lower prices is aimed at improving its competitive position against rival automakers, particularly as more companies enter the electric vehicle market. Companies such as Ford, General Motors, and Volkswagen have all announced ambitious plans to introduce new electric models in the coming years.

In addition to increased competition, Tesla has also faced concerns over demand. The company reported lower-than-expected deliveries in the first quarter of the year, leading some analysts to question whether the electric vehicle market was reaching saturation.

However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has dismissed such concerns, stating that demand for the company's vehicles remains strong. Musk recently stated that Tesla was on track to deliver a record number of vehicles in the second quarter of the year, which would reassure investors and analysts alike.

The price cuts are expected to put pressure on Tesla's profits, which have already been under scrutiny in recent months. The company reported a net loss of $702 million in the first quarter of the year, a wider loss than expected.

However, Musk has repeatedly emphasized that profitability is not the company's primary focus at this stage. Instead, he has talked about the need to expand production and streamline operations, with the goal of making Tesla a more efficient and sustainable company in the long run.

Despite the challenges facing Tesla, the company remains one of the most innovative and exciting players in the electric vehicle market. Its vehicles continue to offer cutting-edge technology and impressive performance, along with the convenience and eco-friendliness of electric power.

The price cuts announced by Tesla are likely to be welcomed by prospective buyers, particularly as they come at a time when many consumers are increasingly interested in electric vehicles. According to a recent survey by AAA, 20% of Americans say they are likely to buy an electric vehicle for their next car, up from 15% in 2017.

However, the success of Tesla and other electric vehicle makers will depend on a number of factors, including consumer perception, infrastructure development, and government policies. While the trend towards electric vehicles is undoubtedly growing, it remains to be seen whether it will continue to gain momentum in the coming years.

Despite the uncertainties, Tesla's latest price cuts are a positive sign for both the company and the electric vehicle market as a whole. In addition to making electric vehicles more affordable and accessible, they also underscore Tesla's commitment to innovation and growth.

As Musk and his team work to build a more sustainable and efficient company, the future of electric vehicles looks brighter than ever. With increased competition and growing demand, the stage is set for a new era of clean, efficient, and exciting driving.",1
76,"As Ukraine war drags on, civilians' mental health needs rise","The war in Ukraine, now rousing for almost a decade, has taken a major toll on civilians. Apart from the physical damage, the mental health of individuals caught up in the conflict has largely been ignored. Mental health experts warn that the conflict has created a mental health crisis in the country.

Unsurprisingly, children have been significantly impacted by the war. They have lost their homes, friends, and family members to the conflict. Many have witnessed brutal violence and lost the feeling of safety. Before the war, children had a life that had routine and structure - they went to school, played with their friends, and had a sense of security, but now, their childhood has been taken away from them.

""I remember when we had to hide in the basement because of the shelling. It was scary, and I kept thinking that we would all die in there,"" said Mariya, a 10-year-old girl living in the conflict zone.

Children have been the least prioritized group in the conflict, meaning they do not have access to adequate mental health support or emotional support from their families, who are also experiencing similar trauma themselves. The lack of resources to address the trauma that children have experienced has led to high rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among them.

The situation has also taken a toll on adults, especially women, who have been forced to bear the brunt of the conflict. They often bear the responsibility of taking care of their families and homes as their husbands are out fighting or have been killed in the conflict. Women are also more exposed to sexual violence and exploitation.

For those who have had to flee their homes and are living in overcrowded housing or refugee camps, the stress and anxiety of not having a home, financial insecurity, and fear for the future have become a part of their daily lives.

""Each day, I wonder how we will survive another day. Everything is uncertain, and it is taking a toll on our mental health,"" said Lyudmila, who fled her home and is now living in a refugee camp.

Veterans have also been significantly affected by the conflict. Many of them have witnessed the horrors of war and returned with physical injuries and psychological trauma that they are often unable to cope with.

""I was in the conflict for two years, and I saw things that no one should ever experience. I came back with PTSD, and it is difficult to cope with daily life,"" said Petro, a Ukrainian veteran.

Sadly, there is a significant lack of resources to address the mental health needs of those impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. A report by the World Health Organization revealed that there are only 0.04 psychiatrists per 10,000 people in Ukraine. This means that there are not enough trained professionals to help those suffering from mental health issues.

Also, cultural and social stigmas around mental health issues have made it difficult for those suffering to seek help. Many people still see mental illnesses as a sign of weakness, and as a result, many people are afraid to ask for help.

The Ukrainian government has made some efforts to address the issue by launching various initiatives, such as opening mental health clinics and creating support groups for those impacted by the conflict. However, these efforts have been insufficient, and more needs to be done to support those suffering from mental health issues.

The international community must step forward to support efforts to address the mental health crisis in Ukraine. Experts warn that if nothing is done, the situation will only worsen, leading to a lifetime of mental health complications for those impacted by the conflict.

The United Nations and organizations such as the International Red Cross have already launched a few initiatives aimed at addressing the issue. Still, more needs to be done to improve access to psychological support services and reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues. With the support of the international community, Ukraine can begin to address the mental health crisis in the country and help those affected by the conflict to rebuild their lives.

The war in Ukraine is one of the longest conflicts in modern history, with no end in sight. While there is a focus on the physical impacts of the conflict, the mental health of individuals impacted is equally important. Mental health support is essential, and the international community must work together to provide the necessary resources to those suffering. Only then can those impacted by the conflict begin to heal and rebuild their lives.",1
77,"Gobert, Wolves get past punch; big man still has back injury","Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert helped his team get the win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night, but it seems his back injury is still bothering him.

Gobert came back after missing two games with back soreness, and he contributed 16 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks in the 116-111 victory against the Timberwolves. But he also had to leave the game in the third quarter after taking a punch from Timberwolves forward Karl-Anthony Towns.

The altercation started after Gobert set a hard screen on Towns, who took exception and pushed Gobert. Gobert then took a swing at Towns, who responded with a punch that landed on Gobert's neck. Both players were ejected from the game.

After the game, Gobert said his back was still bothering him and he would see how it feels on Thursday.

""My back is still a little bit sore, but I tried to fight through it tonight,"" Gobert said. ""Unfortunately, I got hit in the neck and had to leave the game. We'll see how it feels tomorrow.""

Gobert's injury is a concern for the Jazz, who rely heavily on his presence in the paint. Gobert is averaging 14.4 points, 13.4 rebounds and 2.4 blocks per game this season, and he is considered one of the best defensive players in the league.

Jazz coach Quin Snyder said he's hoping Gobert's injury is not too serious.

""He's obviously an important player for us, and we hope he's OK,"" Snyder said. ""But we also have to be prepared to play without him if he's not.""

The Timberwolves, meanwhile, will also be without Towns for the next two games. The NBA suspended Towns for his role in the altercation, and he will miss games against the Washington Wizards and the Milwaukee Bucks.

Towns said he regretted his actions and apologized to his teammates and fans.

""I shouldn't have reacted the way I did, and I apologize to everyone who was affected by my actions,"" Towns said in a statement. ""I'm grateful for the support from my teammates, the Timberwolves organization and the fans, and I will work hard to make sure something like this never happens again.""

The Timberwolves are struggling this season with a 4-2 record and have lost their last two games. Towns is averaging 27.3 points, 11.5 rebounds and 1.0 blocks per game this season.

The Jazz improved to 4-2 with their win over the Timberwolves and will next face the Sacramento Kings on Friday.

Gobert's injury will be a concern for the Jazz, who are hoping to make a deep playoff run this season. Gobert is a key player for the team, and they will need him to be healthy if they want to compete with the top teams in the league.

For now, the Jazz will have to wait and see how Gobert's back injury progresses and hope it's nothing too serious.",1
78,Florida officials cut key data from vaccine study,"In the latest controversy surrounding vaccine data, Florida officials have come under scrutiny for cutting crucial information from a study on the effectiveness of vaccines in preventing COVID-19 spread.

According to a report by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Florida’s government officials deleted data from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on the state’s COVID-19 vaccination progress.

The report, released on May 14, showed mixed results for the state's vaccination campaign. While vaccination rates were high among seniors and healthcare workers, the study reported lower rates among younger age groups and minority communities, raising concerns about equitable vaccine distribution.

The report also included data on the number of breakthrough cases, or COVID-19 infections that occurred after an individual had been fully vaccinated. However, the report did not distinguish between people who received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines versus those who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

According to the Sun-Sentinel, state health officials requested that the CDC remove this information from the report altogether, citing concerns that it could sow distrust in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and discourage people from getting vaccinated.

Florida’s actions have drawn criticism from health experts, who say that transparent and accurate data is crucial to understanding the effectiveness of the vaccines and making informed public health decisions.

“When you suppress data, when you hide things, it’s always for political reasons,” said Dr. Howard Forman, a health policy expert at Yale University. “This is not science. This is politics.”

The incident also comes as vaccine hesitancy remains a significant issue in the U.S. and globally, with many people concerned about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Some experts believe that withholding data on breakthrough cases could further erode public trust in the vaccines.

“Transparency is key to building trust in the vaccine and in public health more broadly,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “The public wants to know how well the vaccines are working, and it’s crucial that we have accurate and complete data.”

Florida’s decision to remove data from the CDC report is just the latest example of how politics and public health messaging can clash. Last year, former President Donald Trump was criticized for pressuring the CDC to downplay the severity of the pandemic, while many Republican governors have refused to implement mask mandates or other public health measures.

As the U.S. continues its vaccination campaign and aims to reach herd immunity, experts say that transparency and accurate data will be key to rebuilding public trust and turning the tide against the pandemic.

“Ultimately, we need people to trust in the vaccines and in public health measures. Without that trust, we won’t be able to control this pandemic,” Adalja said. “We have to be transparent about what we know, what we don’t know and what we’re doing to keep people safe.”",1
79,Bettman voices support for Coyotes' new arena plan,"NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has voiced his support for the Arizona Coyotes' proposal to build a new arena in Tempe. Bettman said in a statement on Friday that the plan is ""a positive step forward for the Coyotes and their fans, and I commend the team for its efforts to secure a long-term home in the Valley.""

The proposed arena would be built on Arizona State University-owned land near Tempe Town Lake, and would also serve as a multi-purpose entertainment facility. The Coyotes have been playing in Glendale at Gila River Arena since 2003, but have encountered numerous difficulties in recent years.

The team has been in talks with ASU for several years about building a new arena, but those discussions stalled in 2017. The recent announcement of a potential partnership between the Coyotes and ASM Global, a leading venue management and services company, helped reignite those talks. According to the team, the partnership with ASM Global would provide essential expertise and resources to help finance and construct the new arena.

The Coyotes have faced financial struggles and attendance issues in recent years, but Bettman expressed optimism about the team's future in the Valley. ""The Coyotes have a strong fan base and a committed ownership group,"" he said. ""With a new arena, they will be well-positioned for sustainable success in Arizona.""",1
80,Swiss seniors take government to European court over climate,"Geneva, Switzerland - A group of Swiss senior citizens has taken their government to the European Court of Human Rights over its inadequate action on climate change. The group, which calls itself ""Grannies for Future,"" consists mostly of women over the age of 75 who are concerned about the world their grandchildren will inherit.

The group argues that Switzerland has failed to take the necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the targets set out in the Paris climate agreement. They say this is a violation of their human rights, including their right to life, health, and a safe environment.

The case is being taken to the European Court of Human Rights because the Swiss courts have refused to hear it. The group says this is because the government has argued that its climate policy is a political matter, not a legal one.

""Climate change is not a political matter, it's a matter of human survival,"" said Jean Ziegler, a Swiss sociologist and former UN rapporteur on the right to food who is helping to represent the group. ""The government has a duty to protect its citizens, especially the most vulnerable.""

The group's case comes as Switzerland faces increased pressure to take more ambitious action on climate change. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the world has just over a decade to drastically reduce emissions and avoid catastrophic climate change.

Switzerland has pledged to reduce its emissions by 50% by 2030, but the country's climate policy has been criticized for not going far enough. The country is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, particularly in the transport sector, and has been accused of dragging its feet on renewable energy.

The ""Grannies for Future"" group says it hopes their legal action will push the government to take more decisive action on climate change. ""We're old, we're retired, but we're still fighting for the future of our grandchildren and for the survival of the planet,"" said Marianne Künzle, one of the group's members.

The European Court of Human Rights is expected to take several months to consider the case. But the ""Grannies for Future"" group says they are prepared to keep fighting for what they see as a fundamental human right. ""We won't stop until our government takes the necessary action to protect us and the planet,"" said Künzle.",1
81,Their stories were lost to slavery. Now DNA is writing them,"For generations, the ancestors of many African Americans have been lost to history. Slavery, which existed in America for over two centuries, stripped people of their names, language, and heritage. The resulting information gap has left many individuals with an incomplete understanding of their family tree.

However, recent advances in genetic technology have revolutionized how people can access the hidden stories of their ancestry. DNA testing has become an increasingly popular tool for people seeking to fill in the missing pieces of their past. For African Americans, these tests have become a way to recover the knowledge that was lost during slavery.

The DNA testing business is booming, with millions of people across the world using ancestry websites like 23andMe and Ancestry.com to learn more about their family history. With just a simple cheek swab, these sites can provide individuals with a detailed breakdown of their ethnic heritage and a list of potential relatives.

But for many African Americans, the tests can reveal much more than just their ethnic background. For these individuals, DNA tests can help piece together the puzzle of their family tree and uncover their origins in Africa.

For years, the search for one's African ancestry was a daunting task. Slave traders often separated families during the transatlantic slave trade, and many records were lost or destroyed. This meant that there was little information available for descendants of slaves trying to find their roots.

However, with the rise of DNA testing, African Americans are now able to connect with their African heritage like never before. The process starts with a DNA sample, usually taken by swabbing the inside of the cheek. The DNA is then sent to a laboratory, where it is analyzed to produce a report detailing the person's genetic makeup.

One of the most significant benefits of these tests is the ability to identify where in Africa a person's ancestors came from. Many modern-day African countries were once home to large empires and kingdoms, each with its unique language and culture. By analyzing a person's DNA, scientists can determine the likely region of origin for the individual's ancestors.

One company that specializes in African DNA testing is African Ancestry. Founded in 2002 by Dr. Rick Kittles, an expert in genetic anthropology, the company aims to help African Americans uncover their roots in Africa. African Ancestry has a database of over 30,000 DNA samples from across the continent, allowing them to offer a highly accurate analysis of a person's ancestry.

""The power of the test lies in its ability to connect people with their roots,"" Dr. Kittles explains. ""We want to help African Americans reclaim their identity and feel empowered by their heritage.""

For individuals who have taken a DNA test, the results can be life-changing. The knowledge of where one's ancestors came from can provide a sense of closure and a deeper understanding of one's place in the world. It can also be a powerful tool for reconnecting with lost relatives.

Take the case of Keenan Scott II, a writer and filmmaker from California. Keenan knew little about his family history beyond his grandparents. His father's side of the family was especially mysterious, with no records of their past in the United States.

Keenan took a DNA test and was surprised to learn that his ancestors hailed from Cameroon and Nigeria. ""It was like a light bulb went off in my head,"" Keenan says. ""I finally knew where I came from, and it opened up a whole new world for me.""

Determined to learn more about his family history, Keenan traveled to Africa, where he discovered that he had distant relatives living in Cameroon. ""It was an incredible feeling to meet people who were my blood relatives,"" Keenan says. ""It made me feel like I was part of something bigger than just myself.""

The ability to connect with long-lost family members is one of the most significant benefits of DNA testing. For many African Americans, these tests can finally fill in the gaps left by slavery and allow them to reunite with relatives they never knew existed.

""The stories of enslaved people were often lost or suppressed, but DNA testing allows us to reclaim our history,"" says Gina Paige, co-founder, and president of African Ancestry. ""We can finally connect the dots and learn about the people who came before us.""

For some individuals, DNA testing has provided a chance to reconnect with their African culture. One such person is Gina Belafonte, the daughter of famed singer and Civil Rights activist Harry Belafonte. Despite growing up surrounded by activism and Black culture, Gina felt a sense of separation from her African roots.

""I always felt like a part of me was missing,"" Gina says. ""I didn't know my ancestry, and I didn't have a connection to Africa.""

Gina took a DNA test and discovered that her ancestors came from Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. ""It was an emotional experience,"" she says. ""I finally had a connection to Africa, and it made me feel whole.""

With this newfound knowledge, Gina has begun a journey of rediscovery. She has traveled to West Africa and immersed herself in the culture, learning about her ancestors and the customs of the region. ""It's been an incredible journey,"" she says. ""I finally feel like I have a sense of what it means to be African.""

While DNA testing has provided many with the opportunity to learn about their African heritage, it is not without controversy. Some have criticized the DNA testing industry for oversimplifying complex genetic histories and perpetuating racial stereotypes.

Others have raised concerns about the privacy implications of giving companies access to one's DNA. With concerns over data breaches and the sharing of this information with third parties, some have expressed reservations about the long-term implications of DNA testing.

Despite these concerns, many African Americans have found immense value in DNA testing. It provides a new way of looking at family history and is changing how people understand their origins. For those seeking to connect with their heritage and rediscover lost stories, DNA testing is a powerful tool that is revolutionizing the way we think about ancestry.",1
82,Biden ends COVID national emergency after Congress acts,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden announced the end of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday, just hours after Congress passed a bill to extend key provisions of his administration’s response to the crisis.

The move comes as the United States sees a significant drop in coronavirus cases and deaths, with more than half of adults now fully vaccinated against the virus. The national emergency declaration had given the government broad powers to combat the pandemic, including the ability to mobilize resources and provide funding to states and localities.

“This is a major milestone in our fight against COVID-19,” Biden said in a statement. “We have made incredible progress in the last several months, and we are confident that we can continue to make progress as we move forward.”

The announcement of the end of the national emergency has been anticipated for weeks, as the administration has ramped up efforts to get more people vaccinated and shift the focus to reopening the economy. The move was met with praise from public health experts, who say that the end of the emergency declaration is a sign of the progress made in the fight against the pandemic.

“Today is a day to celebrate the hard work and resilience of the American people,” said Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We have come a long way in the fight against COVID-19, but we still have work to do to ensure that we stay vigilant and continue to protect our communities.”

The bill passed by Congress on Friday extends key provisions of the administration’s response to the pandemic, including funding for vaccine distribution, support for small businesses and assistance for families struggling to make ends meet.

“We cannot let up now,” Biden said. “Our work is far from over, and we must continue to work together to defeat this virus and build back better.”

While the end of the national emergency marks a significant milestone in the fight against COVID-19, experts warn that the virus is still circulating and that vaccination rates need to continue to increase to maintain control over the pandemic.

“We are not out of the woods yet,” warned Walensky. “Even as we celebrate the progress we have made, we must remain vigilant and continue to follow public health guidelines to keep our communities safe.”",1
83,"Gaudreau scores in OT, Blue Jackets beat Penguins 3-2","In a thrilling match, the Columbus Blue Jackets defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-2 with a sudden-death goal from Johnny Gaudreau in overtime. The win came as a surprise for the Blue Jackets who have struggled in their recent games, winning only three of their last ten matches.

The Penguins took the lead early on in the game with goals from Bryan Rust and Jake Guentzel in the first and second periods, respectively. The Blue Jackets were quick to react and responded with goals from Jack Roslovic and Eric Robinson.

The game remained tied at 2-2 until the end of the third period, leading to a dramatic overtime period. Gaudreau, who was traded to the Blue Jackets just a week ago, scored the winning goal just 58 seconds into overtime, sealing the victory for his new team.

The win comes as a boost for the Blue Jackets, who have had a bumpy season so far. The team will now look to build on their momentum and climb up the standings, as they continue to strive for a playoff spot.

Meanwhile, for the Penguins, the loss will be a setback as they missed the chance to move up to the second spot in the East Division. They will look to bounce back in their next game against the New York Rangers.",1
84,Australia makes biggest carbon polluters curb emissions,"The Australian government has taken a new step in its fight against climate change by enforcing the biggest carbon polluters in the country to curb their emissions. The decision comes as the country experienced devastating bushfires in the past year, which have been linked to global warming.

Australia has been criticized for its lack of action against climate change, even as the country is one of the biggest carbon emitters per capita in the world. However, the government's latest move shows a sign of progress towards a cleaner and greener future for the country.

The new policy, called the ""Safeguard Mechanism,"" enforces companies that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) annually to keep their emissions within an individual baseline limit. These baseline limits will be set by the government and will be specific to each individual facility's needs.

Companies that exceed their baseline limits will be required to offset their excess emissions by purchasing carbon credits, which will finance emissions reduction projects in other parts of the country.

The Safeguard Mechanism is expected to drive down emissions by up to 250 million tonnes by 2030, which is roughly equal to taking 55 million cars off the road for a year.

""The Safeguard Mechanism is a cornerstone of our climate change policy, which will drive down emissions while securing economic growth and development,"" Australian Environment Minister Sussan Ley said in a press release.

The move has been lauded by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, who have been advocating for more action in reducing carbon emissions for years.

""This is a significant step forward for Australia in fighting climate change, but we need to do more,"" said David Ritter, CEO of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. ""We urge the government to increase the targets set under the Safeguard Mechanism to ensure that we meet our commitments to the Paris Agreement in reducing emissions.""

Australia has pledged to reduce its emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030, as part of the Paris Agreement. However, the country has been criticized for not doing enough to meet these targets.

The government's latest move is also expected to put pressure on other countries to follow suit in curbing carbon emissions. With Australia being one of the biggest carbon emitters in the world, the implementation of the Safeguard Mechanism sends a strong message to other nations to take action against climate change.

""The Safeguard Mechanism is a clear signal to the world that Australia is taking its responsibility for climate action seriously,"" said Ley.

The Safeguard Mechanism will also provide economic benefits by driving innovation and creating new jobs in renewable energy and emissions reduction industries.

""There will be significant opportunities for businesses that take action to reduce their emissions through energy efficiency upgrades, low-emissions technologies, and investments in renewable energy,"" Ley said.

The implementation of the Safeguard Mechanism has been a long time coming for Australia, with the country being criticized for its inaction in reducing carbon emissions in the past. However, the government's latest move shows that the country is taking steps towards a cleaner and greener future.

""We welcome this historic decision, which is a good start, but we know there is much more that needs to be done,"" Ritter said. ""We call on the government to continue to increase its efforts in reducing carbon emissions and investing in renewable energy to ensure a sustainable future for our country."" 

In conclusion, Australia's decision to enforce its biggest carbon polluters to curb emissions is a significant step forward in the fight against climate change. The Safeguard Mechanism is expected to drive down emissions, create economic benefits, and put pressure on other countries to follow suit. While there is still much work to be done, the implementation of the Safeguard Mechanism is a positive sign towards a cleaner and greener future for Australia.",1
85,Claims guards aided killer fake death in S. Africa jailbreak,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) - South African authorities are investigating claims that prison guards assisted a notorious prisoner in his successful escape from custody. The prisoner in question, who was serving a life sentence for murder and a string of other offenses, was able to allegedly bribe his way out of prison with the help of his accomplices, including some of the prison guards.

According to the South African Ministry of Justice, the prisoner had managed to pay off his jailers and stage a fake death in order to escape from the maximum-security prison. The ministry has launched an urgent investigation into the incident and said it was taking the matter very seriously.

Speaking to reporters in Johannesburg, Justice Minister Ronald Lamola condemned the alleged collusion of the prison guards, saying that such corruption would not be tolerated. ""It's an indication that there are still people who are prepared to undermine the authority of the state by going against their oath of office,"" he said.

The prisoner, who has not been named by officials, was reportedly able to bribe his way out of the prison using a combination of cash and favors. Once outside the prison walls, he faked his own death and managed to escape undetected, according to the ministry. His accomplices, including some of the prison guards, are said to have then helped him flee the area.

The ministry has declined to comment on the specifics of the incident or the identity of the prisoner in question, citing an ongoing investigation. However, local media outlets have identified the prisoner as a notorious gang leader who has been linked to a series of high-profile crimes in recent years, including murders, robberies, and drug trafficking.

The incident has raised serious concerns about the state of South Africa's prisons, which have long been plagued by overcrowding, underfunding, and corruption. Last year, a report by the South African Human Rights Commission found that many of the country's prisons were in a state of crisis, with widespread abuse, neglect, and mistreatment of inmates.

The ministry has acknowledged these challenges but said it was committed to improving conditions for prisoners and cracking down on corruption within the system. ""We cannot have a situation where criminals are given free rein to escape justice by bribing their way out of prison,"" Lamola said.

The ministry has vowed to track down and prosecute all those involved in the alleged prison break, including the prisoners and the rogue guards. It has appealed to the public for any information that could help the police in their investigation.

The incident has also sparked outrage among politicians, activists, and ordinary South Africans, who have condemned the corruption and lawlessness that allowed the prisoner to escape. Many have called for a complete overhaul of the country's criminal justice system, including its prisons.

""South Africa needs a justice system that is fair, impartial, and transparent,"" said opposition politician Phumzile van Damme. ""We cannot allow a few corrupt officials to undermine the rule of law and the safety of our citizens.""

The ministry has urged patience and caution as the investigation unfolds, warning against speculation and fake news. It has also warned against attempts by the prisoner's accomplices to intimidate or harm witnesses.

""We are dealing with a highly dangerous and violent criminal, who will stop at nothing to escape justice,"" said Lamola. ""We urge anyone with information to come forward and help us put him back behind bars, where he belongs.""

The incident is a stark reminder of the persistent challenges facing South Africa's criminal justice system, which has been riddled with corruption, inefficiency, and abuse for years. While authorities say they are committed to reforming the system, many believe that more needs to be done to ensure that criminals are held accountable and that justice is served.",1
86,Global takedown of cybercriminals behind malware operation,"In a coordinated effort, law enforcement agencies from around the world brought down a notorious gang of cybercriminals behind a massive malware operation. The operation, which spanned over five years, targeted businesses and individuals across the globe, causing millions of dollars in losses.

The operation, code-named ""Operation Neptun,"" was led by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) in partnership with agencies from the US, UK, Switzerland, and Canada. The operation resulted in the arrest of 10 individuals in Ukraine and the seizure of computer equipment, cash, and other assets.

According to the authorities, the group was responsible for distributing a wide range of malware, including ransomware, spyware, and banking trojans. The malware was distributed via phishing emails, malicious websites, and social media platforms.

The gang's main targets were businesses in the financial and healthcare sectors, but they also targeted individuals by infecting their computers with malware that allowed the criminals to steal their personal information and use it for identity theft and other types of fraud.

In one case, the gang targeted a UK-based company, infecting 2,000 computers with ransomware and demanding a payment of $1.25 million in return for the decryption key. The company refused to pay and suffered significant damage as a result. In another case, the gang targeted a healthcare provider, infecting their network with spyware that allowed them to access patient data and other sensitive information.

Europol has described Operation Neptun as a ""major success"" in the fight against cybercrime. The agency's Executive Director, Catherine De Bolle, praised the cooperation between international law enforcement agencies, saying that ""it sends a clear message to cybercriminals that they are not invincible and will be held accountable for their actions.”

The operation is a reminder that cybercrime is a global threat that requires international cooperation and coordination. As more businesses and individuals move online, the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches continues to rise. It is important for organizations and individuals to be vigilant and take steps to protect themselves from cyber threats.

Europol has advised businesses and individuals to keep their software and security systems up to date, use strong passwords, and be cautious of suspicious emails and websites. They have also encouraged organizations to report any incidents of cybercrime to their local law enforcement agencies.

The takedown of this cybercriminal gang is a significant achievement, but it is just one step in the ongoing battle against cybercrime. With the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, it is essential for law enforcement agencies, governments, and the private sector to continue working together to combat this threat.",1
87,Judge affirms stricter interpretation of federal mining law,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a move that could have significant implications for the mining industry, a federal judge in Wyoming has affirmed a stricter interpretation of a federal mining law, setting the stage for potentially tougher regulations on mine operators.

Judge Scott Skavdahl issued an opinion on Tuesday that upheld the U.S. Department of the Interior's authority to revoke or suspend mining permits if a company fails to meet the terms of its permit or if its mining operations cause environmental harm. The ruling clarifies that agencies have the power to take enforcement action against mines that violate the terms of their permits, even if those violations do not result in significant environmental harm.

The dispute arose after the Department of the Interior found that a coal mine in Wyoming, owned by Arch Coal, had violated the terms of its permit by failing to pay royalties on coal extracted from federal lands. The agency proposed revoking the mine's permit, but Arch Coal challenged the decision in court, arguing that the agency did not have the authority to take enforcement action based on such a minor violation.

In his ruling, Skavdahl rejected Arch Coal's argument and sided with the Department of the Interior, saying that the agency's interpretation of the mining law was reasonable and in line with Congress's intent.

""The Department's interpretation of the statute as allowing for the revocation or suspension of a mining permit for a minor violation is reasonable and consistent with the purpose of the statute,"" Skavdahl wrote in his opinion. ""Congress intended for the Secretary of the Interior to exercise broad discretion in regulating mining operations on public lands, and the Secretary has the authority to take enforcement action against mines that violate the terms of their permits.""

The ruling is a significant victory for environmental groups, who have long argued that the Department of the Interior has not done enough to enforce the mining law and protect public lands from the impacts of mining. The decision could pave the way for more aggressive enforcement of mining permits, particularly in the coal industry, which has faced mounting financial pressure in recent years due to competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources.

""The court's ruling affirms that mining companies must comply with their obligations to pay royalties, protect the environment, and meet other requirements set forth in their permits,"" said Shannon Anderson, a staff attorney with the Powder River Basin Resource Council, one of the groups that intervened in the case. ""This decision is a win for the public, who deserve to have their lands and resources protected from the negative impacts of mining.""

But industry groups warned that the ruling could have unintended consequences for mining companies that are already struggling to survive in a difficult economic climate. The National Mining Association, which also intervened in the case, argued that the decision could lead to excessive regulation that would stifle economic growth and lead to job losses.

""Any time there's a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the regulatory environment, it creates a chilling effect on investment and job creation,"" said Ashley Burke, the group's senior vice president of communications. ""We need to strike a balance between protecting the environment and promoting economic growth, and this ruling tips the scale too far in favor of regulation.""

The ruling comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the mining industry under the Biden administration, which has signaled its intention to impose stricter regulations on fossil fuel extraction and promote cleaner energy sources. Since taking office, President Biden has paused new oil and gas leases on public lands and signaled his support for policies that would incentivize renewable energy development.

While the ruling specifically deals with coal mining, it could have broader implications for other forms of mining as well, including precious metals and minerals. Environmental groups have long argued that mining operations have a significant impact on water quality, wildlife habitat, and air pollution, and have called for stricter regulations to protect public lands and communities.

The Department of the Interior did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. It is unclear whether the agency will seek to revoke Arch Coal's permit in light of the decision, or if the company will attempt to appeal the ruling.",1
88,Montana abortion proposal met with preemptive lawsuit,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Montana’s Legislature is set to consider a proposal that would effectively ban abortions in the state, with no exceptions for rape or incest. But even before the proposal was introduced, a preemptive lawsuit was filed by reproductive rights groups challenging its constitutionality.

State Rep. Lola Sheldon-Galloway, R-Great Falls, has introduced a bill that would classify a fertilized egg, embryo, or fetus as a person, effectively criminalizing all abortions. The proposal would also outlaw popular forms of birth control and fertility treatments that can result in the destruction of an embryo.

“This bill is about the sanctity of human life, and it’s time we recognize that every life is valuable and deserves protection,” Sheldon-Galloway said.

But reproductive rights groups argue that the proposed legislation would violate a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion, as recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark 1973 case Roe v. Wade. The preemptive lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Montana and Planned Parenthood of Montana seeks to prevent the proposal from ever being enforced if passed.

“The bill represents a direct affront to Roe v. Wade, which has been the law of the land for almost fifty years,” said Alex Rate, legal director of the ACLU of Montana. “We’re filing this lawsuit to protect Montanans’ constitutional right to make their own healthcare decisions, including the decision to have an abortion.”

The lawsuit argues that the proposed legislation violates a woman’s constitutional right to privacy by banning abortion. It also contends that the ban on birth control and fertility treatments is unconstitutional because it infringes upon a woman’s right to family planning and reproductive health.

The proposal is just the latest in a wave of anti-abortion laws being introduced across the country, with conservative lawmakers hoping to overturn Roe v. Wade under the Supreme Court’s new conservative majority. In recent years, states like Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio have passed sweeping restrictions on abortion, with many facing legal challenges.

Supporters of the Montana bill say that it’s necessary to protect the unborn and that it’s time for states to challenge the status quo.

“Too long have states been afraid to act against the Supreme Court’s overreach in Roe v. Wade,” said Jeff Laszloffy, president of the Montana Family Foundation. “It’s time for Montana to stand up for life and challenge the unconstitutional status quo.”

Opponents of the proposal argue that the legislation would have dire consequences, not just for women seeking abortions, but for all women looking to access reproductive healthcare.

“If this bill were to become law, it would be catastrophic for women in Montana,” said Caitlin Borgmann, executive director of the American Constitutional Society. “It would strip away a woman’s ability to make decisions about her health and her future.”

The proposal also faces opposition from the medical community, with groups like the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists denouncing the legislation as harmful to women’s health.

“We urge lawmakers to reject this harmful proposal and instead focus on policies that promote access to the full range of reproductive healthcare, including contraception and safe, legal abortion,” said Dr. Maureen Phipps, CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Whether or not the Montana Legislature will pass the proposal remains to be seen, but the preemptive lawsuit filed by reproductive rights groups suggests that the battle over abortion rights in the state is far from over.

“We’ll do whatever it takes to ensure that women in Montana have access to the healthcare they need and deserve,” said Martha Stahl, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana. “We won’t allow this unconstitutional proposal to become law.” 

The bill is set to be heard in committee in the coming weeks, and it’s likely that the legal battle will continue long after the legislative session ends.",1
89,"After calls to resign, Feinstein seeks Judiciary replacement","After facing intense backlash from members of her own party, California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein has announced that she will be stepping down as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 

Feinstein had been under increasing pressure to resign from her position, following her handling of the confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Democrats were quick to criticize Feinstein for her perceived lack of aggression and preparedness during the hearings, with some even calling for her to step down from the committee entirely. 

In a statement released on Monday, Feinstein said that she had spoken with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about her decision to resign. ""I am honored to have served on the committee for so many years and I believe Democratic priorities would be better served by having someone else in that position,"" she said. 

Feinstein went on to thank her colleagues for their support over the years, calling her tenure on the committee ""one of the great highlights of my career."" While she did not specify who she believed should replace her, Feinstein called for a member of the committee who was ""better prepared"" to lead Democrats in their efforts to oppose the Trump administration's judicial nominees. 

The news of Feinstein's resignation comes as Democrats gear up for what is expected to be a bitter fight over President-elect Joe Biden's judicial nominations. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the Senate, Democrats will need to be united and forceful in their opposition if they hope to block any of Biden's nominees. 

Feinstein herself acknowledged the stakes of the upcoming fight in her statement. ""Our courts are being packed with unqualified, ideological judges who threaten our democratic institutions,"" she said. ""Our democracy is on the line, and I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that we have a Judiciary Committee that is up to the challenge."" 

Feinstein's decision to step down as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee has already drawn praise from some of her fellow Democrats. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who has been critical of Feinstein's handling of the Barrett hearings in the past, called the move ""a good decision."" 

""Senator Feinstein has been a valuable member of the Judiciary Committee for many years,"" Whitehouse said in a statement. ""But her handling of the Barrett nomination was, in my opinion, a misstep. I believe it is in the best interests of the committee and the party for her to step aside."" 

Other Democrats were more cautious in their response to Feinstein's resignation. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, another member of the Judiciary Committee, praised Feinstein's contributions to the committee but declined to comment on her decision to step down. 

""I think Senator Feinstein has been an outstanding member of the Judiciary Committee for many years,"" Blumenthal said in a statement. ""But I think it's premature to comment on any possible changes to the committee's leadership at this time."" 

Feinstein's resignation also raises questions about the future of the Judiciary Committee itself. With Democrats set to take control of the Senate in January, some have speculated that the committee's makeup could change significantly. 

One potential candidate to replace Feinstein as ranking member is Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. Durbin is currently the Senate Minority Whip and has served on the Judiciary Committee for over two decades. Durbin has not commented on whether he intends to seek the position. 

The Judiciary Committee is responsible for overseeing all nominations to the federal judiciary, as well as conducting oversight hearings on the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies. In recent years, the committee has become a key battleground in the partisan fight over the courts, with Republicans using their majority to confirm a slew of conservative judges appointed by President Trump. 

As Democrats look to take control of the Senate and begin the process of confirming Biden's nominees, the question of who will lead the Judiciary Committee is sure to be closely watched. With tensions running high within the party, the decision could have significant implications for the future of the Democratic agenda. 

Feinstein's resignation, while surprising, is perhaps a sign that Democrats are taking the challenges they are facing seriously. As the party looks to build back stronger in the wake of the Trump presidency, finding the right leadership for the Judiciary Committee will be crucial. For now, Democrats will have to wait and see who will step up to replace Feinstein and take on this vital role.",1
90,Mexican migration chief to be charged in fire but keep job,"Mexico's migration chief, Tonatiuh Guillén, is set to be charged with criminal negligence in connection with a fire at a government shelter for migrants that left 50 people dead. However, despite the pending charges, he will keep his position as head of the National Migration Institute.

The fire at the Buen Pastor shelter in Tijuana broke out in February 2021, and quickly spread, killing 50 people and injuring dozens more. The shelter is run by the Mexican government and was meant to house migrants who were waiting for asylum processing.

An investigation into the fire revealed that it was started by a propane gas leak, but that a number of safety concerns had been ignored by officials in charge of the shelter. The investigation also found that the shelter was overcrowded and that the staff were not adequately trained to respond to an emergency.

Guillén, who was appointed as head of the National Migration Institute in 2018, was directly responsible for the management of the Buen Pastor shelter at the time of the fire. He has been criticized by human rights groups for his handling of the crisis, and his role in the tragedy has been called into question.

Despite the serious nature of the charges that Guillén is set to face, the Mexican government has indicated that he will keep his job as migration chief. This decision has been met with outrage by migrants' rights groups, who argue that Guillén should be held accountable for his actions.

""The fact that Tonatiuh Guillén will keep his job is deeply troubling,"" said Erika Andiola, Chief Advocacy Officer for RAICES, a migrant advocacy organization. ""This sends a message that government officials can disregard the safety and well-being of migrants, and still avoid any real consequences.""

In response to the criticism, the Mexican government has defended its decision to keep Guillén in his position. The government has pointed to Guillén's experience in the field of migration and his leadership in implementing initiatives to aid migrants in Mexico.

""The National Migration Institute is a key institution in managing the flow of migrants into Mexico,"" said a spokesperson for the government. ""While we acknowledge the mistakes made by Tonatiuh Guillén in the case of the Buen Pastor fire, we believe that his experience and qualifications make him the best person to continue leading the institute.""

Despite the government's defense of Guillén, it is clear that the case has further exposed the challenges facing migrants in Mexico. Over the past few years, Mexico has become an increasingly complex and dangerous transit point for migrants from Central America and elsewhere who are seeking to reach the United States.

According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 1.2 million migrants were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019, the highest number in over a decade. Many of these migrants have fled violence and poverty in their home countries, and have turned to Mexico as a gateway to a better life.

However, Mexico's increasingly strict immigration policies and the presence of organized crime groups along migratory routes have made the journey more dangerous than ever before. Migrants are vulnerable to violence and exploitation, and are often subjected to brutal treatment at the hands of criminal gangs.

In light of these challenges, human rights groups have called for an overhaul of Mexico's immigration system, including changes to its detention policies and better training for government officials who work with migrants.

""A tragedy like the Buen Pastor fire should never happen again,"" said Andiola. ""It's clear that there are deep-seated problems in Mexico's immigration system that need to be addressed. We need real action to protect the rights and safety of migrants.""

For Guillén, the charges and the criticism are a major setback in a career that has been dedicated to improving conditions for migrants in Mexico. As he faces the charges and works to address the crisis at the border, it is clear that his leadership will be tested in the months and years ahead.",1
91,Taiwan's ruling party taps VP as presidential candidate,"Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has officially named Vice President William Lai as its presidential candidate for the 2020 election.

The announcement was made on Monday at a press conference held by President Tsai Ing-wen, who is also the chairperson of the DPP.

Lai, a former premier, was appointed as vice president in January 2019. He is known for his reformist views and has been a vocal supporter of Taiwan's independence.

In his acceptance speech, Lai emphasized the need to continue the DPP's policies on democracy and human rights, as well as its efforts to boost the economy and improve social welfare.

""We must continue to defend Taiwan's sovereignty and maintain regional peace, while also advancing our role in the international community,"" Lai said.

He also pledged to strengthen ties with the United States and other key allies, amid ongoing pressure from China, which considers Taiwan to be a part of its territory and has increased its efforts to isolate the island diplomatically.

The announcement comes amid growing tensions between Taipei and Beijing, which has stepped up military drills and other aggressive actions in the waters surrounding Taiwan.

Last year, the DPP suffered a major setback in local elections, with the party losing several key cities to the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).

However, Tsai's popularity has rebounded in recent months, following her strong response to the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and her vocal opposition to China's attempts to interfere in Taiwan's internal affairs.

Political analysts say that Lai's nomination signals the DPP's commitment to defending Taiwan's sovereignty, amid growing concerns about China's expanding influence in the region.

""William Lai is a trusted ally of President Tsai and is seen as a strong advocate for Taiwan's independence,"" said political analyst Huang Kwei-bo.

""He has a strong track record on human rights and social welfare issues, and his nomination sends a clear message that the DPP is united in its commitment to protecting Taiwan's democracy and sovereignty.""

The presidential election is scheduled for January 2020, with the winner expected to take office in May. The KMT has yet to announce its presidential candidate, but reports suggest that KMT Chairman Wu Den-yih is considering a run.",1
92,"As many as 400,000 migrants may cross Darien Gap in 2023","According to a new report, as many as 400,000 migrants from South America could attempt to cross the treacherous Darien Gap in 2023, despite the numerous dangers and challenges involved in the journey.

The Darien Gap is a 66-mile stretch of dense jungle and swampland that separates Panama from Colombia. It is a notoriously dangerous and difficult area to navigate, with no roads or infrastructure, and is also inhabited by drug traffickers, smugglers, and other criminal groups.

Despite these risks, a growing number of migrants are attempting to cross the Darien Gap to continue their journey to the United States or Canada. In 2020, an estimated 16,000 people attempted the crossing, up from 3,000 in 2019.

The report, published by the Inter-American Dialogue and the Migration Policy Institute, warns that this number is likely to increase dramatically in the coming years, reaching up to 400,000 by 2023. This would place an enormous strain on the resources of both Panama and Colombia, as well as on international aid organizations.

To address this issue, the report recommends that the international community invest in infrastructure, including a road or bridge linking Colombia and Panama, as well as increasing funding for humanitarian assistance and community development in the region.

The report also calls for greater cooperation between the governments of Colombia, Panama, and the United States to address the root causes of migration, including poverty, violence, and political instability, and to create more legal channels for migration.

However, some experts caution that building a road or bridge across the Darien Gap could exacerbate the problem by making it easier for drug traffickers and other criminal groups to move through the region.

Despite these challenges, it is clear that the issue of migration through the Darien Gap will only become more urgent in the coming years. It is up to the international community to work together to address this complex and multifaceted problem and to find a sustainable solution that protects the human rights and dignity of all those involved.",1
93,Southwest CEO's compensation soars despite December debacle,"The CEO of Southwest Airlines, Gary Kelly, received a compensation package of $10.4 million for 2017, despite the airline experiencing a public relations debacle in December when a computer glitch caused thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed.

The package is a 50% increase from Kelly's compensation in 2016, according to a company proxy statement. The statement also showed that Kelly's base salary remained unchanged at $700,000, but the majority of his compensation came in the form of stock awards and other forms of incentive compensation.

The airline faced criticism in December after a computer glitch caused a backup of flights during the busy holiday season, leading to thousands of cancelled or delayed flights. The incident left thousands of passengers stranded and caused Southwest to issue refunds to many affected customers.

Despite the incident, Southwest still reported a net income of $3.5 billion for the year, up from $2.2 billion in 2016. The airline also announced plans to order more than 200 planes from Boeing, further solidifying its position as one of the largest carriers in the United States.

Some shareholders have criticized Kelly's compensation, particularly after the December debacle, arguing that it is disproportionate to the company's performance. However, Southwest's board of directors defended Kelly's compensation, saying that it is in line with the company's strong financial performance and consistent with industry standards.

Kelly has been CEO of Southwest since 2004 and has been credited with leading the company through many difficult times, including September 11th and the 2008 financial crisis. Under his leadership, the airline has become one of the most profitable and reliable carriers in the United States.

Despite the criticism, Kelly's compensation package reflects the continued success of Southwest and its position as a major player in the airline industry.",1
94,"Anne Perry, crime writer with a murderous past, dead at 84","Anne Perry, a crime writer who achieved worldwide fame has died at the age of 84. She was best known for her Victorian-era murder mysteries, which have been translated into dozens of languages and adapted into films and television shows. However, Perry had a dark past, having been convicted of murder in her youth.

Born Juliet Hulme in London in 1938, Perry was raised in New Zealand. In 1954, when she was just 16, she and her friend Pauline Parker bludgeoned Parker's mother to death with a brick in a park outside of Christchurch. The pair had been obsessed with their own fantasy world and were convinced that Parker's mother was a threat to their friendship. They were both convicted of murder and served five years in prison before being paroled in 1959.

After her release, Hulme changed her name to Anne Perry and began her writing career. She drew on her experience in prison and her love of Victorian literature to create her detective novels, which often featured themes of obsession, guilt, and redemption. Her most famous works include the Thomas Pitt series, which chronicles the investigations of a police detective in Victorian London, and the William Monk series, which follows a private investigator in the same era.

Despite her success, Perry's past haunted her throughout her career. She rarely spoke about the murder and refused to discuss it in interviews. However, in 2006, she reluctantly agreed to appear in the documentary ""Anne Perry: Interiors,"" which explored her life and work. In the film, Perry revealed that she had long struggled with feelings of guilt and shame over the murder, and that her writing was a way of processing her trauma.

""I don't think I will ever get over it,"" Perry said in the film. ""But I can live with it, and that's what I try to do.""

Perry's readers were divided in their opinions of her past. Some were fascinated by the connection between her crime and her art, while others were appalled that a convicted murderer could achieve such success in the literary world. However, Perry remained a popular author, and her books continued to be widely read until her death.

In a statement, Perry's publisher, Random House, praised her contributions to the world of crime fiction.

""Anne Perry was a remarkable writer and a true original,"" the statement read. ""Her vivid depictions of Victorian life and her unparalleled ability to craft suspenseful, twisty plots captivated readers around the globe. She will be deeply missed.""

Perry's death has sparked renewed interest in her life and work. Some fans have expressed a desire to revisit her novels with a new understanding of the emotions and experiences that informed them, while others have called for a reappraisal of her legacy in light of her past.

Regardless of how readers feel about her crime, however, there is no denying the impact that Anne Perry had on the genre of crime fiction. She was a formidable talent who used her writing to confront her demons, and her death is a loss to the literary world.",1
95,Massive fishing boat fire spews smoke in Seattle area,"Seattle - A massive fire engulfed a fishing boat at the Port of Seattle on Wednesday, spewing thick black smoke that could be seen from miles away.

According to the Seattle Fire Department, the boat was about 200 feet long and approximately 60 feet high, and is believed to have been docked when the fire broke out.

The cause of the fire is unknown at this time, but firefighters are working to put it out. The boat is said to be one of the largest in the Seattle fishing fleet.

Smoke from the fire could be seen as far away as Tacoma, more than 30 miles south of the port. People in Seattle also reported seeing the black smoke from various locations around the city.

“Wow, I’m seeing a huge plume of smoke coming from Seattle area,” tweeted KOMO News anchor Molly Shen. “Any idea what’s going on?”

Another witness, who was driving on the freeway at the time of the fire, said the smoke was so thick that it was difficult to see the boat itself.

“It was just a wall of black smoke,” she said. “You couldn’t even see the boat.”

Thankfully, there have been no reported injuries at this point. The Port of Seattle remains open, but traffic in the area has been affected by the blaze.

The Seattle Fire Department has asked people to avoid the area while they work to put out the fire. They have also sent boats to the scene to help in the effort.

This is not the first time a fishing boat has caught fire in the Seattle area. In 2016, a 130-foot fish processing boat caught fire in the same port, causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage.

The investigation into the cause of this fire will take some time, but firefighters are optimistic that they will be able to put it out soon. In the meantime, the city of Seattle is asking people to stay calm and avoid the area until further notice.",1
96,No driver? No problem. Robotaxis eye San Francisco expansion,"San Francisco may soon become home to a new breed of taxi: robotaxis. These autonomous vehicles have been making waves in the industry, with large players such as Google and Uber leading the charge. Now, several startup companies are setting their sights on the City by the Bay for their pilot programs.

Robotaxis are vehicles that operate without a driver or human intervention. They use a combination of advanced sensors, cameras, mapping software and artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate roads, recognize traffic signals, and make safe driving decisions. While the technology is still in its early stages, the potential benefits are enormous. A fleet of robotaxis could reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and provide transportation services to underserved communities.

One startup leading the charge in the race to bring robotaxis to San Francisco is Zoox. Founded in 2014, Zoox has developed a uniquely designed vehicle that can ferry passengers without a human behind the wheel. The vehicle has four-wheel steering and is completely symmetrical, allowing the vehicle to drive in either direction with ease. Zoox is currently testing its technology in Las Vegas and San Francisco and plans to launch its pilot service sometime in 2022.

Another player in the space is Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors. Cruise is testing its autonomous technology in San Francisco with a fleet of electric vehicles that are equipped with sensors and cameras. The company plans to launch its own ride-hailing service in the city once its technology is proven to be safe and reliable.

These companies are not alone in their pursuit of robotaxis. Local startups such as Voyage and Drive.ai are also testing their own autonomous vehicles in the city. And with the recent acquisition of Uber’s self-driving division by Aurora, a Silicon Valley-based startup, the competition is heating up.

But with the potential benefits come concerns about safety and regulatory oversight. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has established a regulatory framework for autonomous vehicles that requires companies to obtain a special permit before testing on public roads. The permit requires companies to report any accidents, disengagements, or other incidents involving their vehicles. The DMV has also established guidelines for the operation of autonomous vehicles, including requirements for remote monitoring and reporting.

In addition to regulatory oversight, there are also concerns about the job losses that could result from a fleet of driverless taxies. The traditional taxi industry has been in decline in recent years, and the advent of autonomous taxis could exacerbate this trend. Some experts have called for a comprehensive plan to retrain displaced workers and provide new opportunities for them.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of robotaxis are clear. No longer will San Francisco residents need to worry about finding parking or navigating through traffic. Robotaxis could alleviate traffic congestion by providing a more efficient and streamlined transportation system. It could also improve road safety by reducing the number of accidents caused by human error.

Moreover, the advent of autonomous vehicles could revolutionize the transportation industry as a whole. Some experts predict that ride-hailing services could eventually become so affordable and convenient that personal car ownership will no longer make sense for most households. This shift could reduce the number of cars on the road, which in turn could lead to less air pollution and a smaller carbon footprint.

As these companies continue to test their technology on San Francisco’s streets, it remains to be seen whether they will overcome the regulatory hurdles and technical challenges they face. But with the potential benefits of robotaxis, it’s clear that the industry will continue to push forward in pursuit of a driverless future.

San Francisco has long been a hub of innovation and disruption, and the advent of robotaxis is just the latest example. While there are valid concerns about the impact on jobs and safety, the potential benefits of this technology are too great to ignore. As we move forward into an uncertain future, it’s clear that autonomous vehicles will play a major role in shaping the transportation system of tomorrow.",1
97,Experts doubt Mexico's pledge to protect endangered porpoise,"Mexico’s announcement of implementing measures to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise has been met with skepticism by experts, who doubt the government’s commitment to carrying out its promise.

The vaquita, a small porpoise that lives in the Gulf of California, is one of the most endangered marine mammals in the world. With less than 10 left in the wild, the species is at great risk of extinction. The main threat to the vaquita population is illegal fishing for a fish called the totoaba, which is also critically endangered.

The Mexican government announced in May that it would implement a new program aimed at combating the illegal fishing operations that threaten both species. The program includes the installation of surveillance cameras in the Gulf, the deployment of additional navy personnel to the region, and the banning of gillnets, which are used in the illegal fishing trade.

However, critics say that the program is unlikely to be effective without strict enforcement measures and the political will to enforce them. “What we really need to see is a serious commitment from the Mexican government to tackle this issue head-on,” said Sarah Uhlemann, international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

Mexico’s history on the issue has done little to inspire confidence among conservationists. Despite previous promises to protect the vaquita and to crack down on the illegal fishing trade, the government has yet to take meaningful action.

“They’ve had several years to deal with this issue, and yet the vaquita population continues to decline,” said Cynthia Smith, executive director of the National Marine Mammal Foundation. “It’s hard to believe that anything will change this time around.”

The new program also fails to address the root cause of the illegal fishing trade: the high demand for totoaba swim bladders in China. The bladders, which are considered a delicacy in China and are believed to have medicinal properties, can fetch as much as $20,000 per kilogram on the black market.

Until the demand for totoaba bladders is addressed, many experts believe that the illegal fishing trade will continue, putting both the vaquita and totoaba at great risk. “We need to see a concerted effort from the Mexican and Chinese governments to crack down on this trade,” said Uhlemann.

Even if the illegal fishing trade were to be completely eradicated, the vaquita’s future remains uncertain. The species has suffered from a series of environmental setbacks in recent years, including the loss of habitat due to pollution and degradation of the Gulf of California.

Conservationists say that the only hope for the species is the implementation of a comprehensive conservation plan that addresses all of the threats facing the vaquita.

“We need to see a long-term commitment to protecting this species,” said Smith. “That means addressing not just the illegal fishing trade, but also pollution and habitat loss.”

Despite the challenges that lie ahead, many experts remain hopeful that the vaquita can be saved. “It’s too early to give up on this species,” said Uhlemann. “We have a responsibility to do everything we can to protect them.”

However, without a serious commitment from the Mexican government and the cooperation of the Chinese government, the future of the vaquita remains uncertain. Until decisive action is taken to protect the species and its habitat, the vaquita’s fate hangs in the balance.",1
98,US intelligence leak complicates summit with South Korea,"WASHINGTON DC - A recent leak of classified information from the United States intelligence community has added a new hurdle to the upcoming summit with South Korea. The leak, which reportedly revealed ongoing surveillance efforts into North Korea's weapons program, has caused frustration and concern among South Korean officials.

The leak, which has not been officially confirmed, was first reported by The Washington Post and later picked up by a number of other news outlets. According to the reports, the leak revealed that the US has been secretly monitoring North Korea's missile tests and other weapons-related activities.

It's not yet clear how the leak occurred, but the US intelligence community is now conducting an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, South Korean officials have expressed frustration with the situation, saying that leaks like this only serve to undermine the trust between allies.

""We are deeply concerned about this leak of sensitive information,"" said a South Korean official who declined to be named. ""We have been working closely with the US to address the North Korean threat, and leaks like this make it harder to do our job effectively.""

The leak comes just weeks before the scheduled summit between President Biden and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The summit was expected to be an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss a range of issues, including North Korea, trade, and regional security.

However, the leak has now complicated matters, casting a shadow over the upcoming talks. Some experts have suggested that South Korean officials may now be less willing to share sensitive information with their US counterparts, fearing that it could be leaked in the future.

Others have suggested that the leak could also have an impact on the ongoing negotiations with North Korea. The US has been seeking to restart talks with North Korea over its nuclear program, but the leak could make it more difficult to gain Pyongyang's trust.

""Leaks like this can be very damaging to the trust-building process,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. ""They can create the perception that the US is not a reliable partner, and that can make it harder to achieve our objectives.""

The leak has also prompted questions about the broader issue of leaks within the US intelligence community. The Trump administration was plagued by a series of leaks throughout its time in office, many of which were related to sensitive national security issues.

There are concerns that the Biden administration may be facing similar challenges. Last month, the director of national intelligence issued a memo warning intelligence officials about the dangers of unauthorized disclosures and leaks.

""Unauthorized disclosures weaken our national security,"" the memo read. ""They jeopardize the safety and security of American personnel and operations. They harm our foreign relationships and our standing in the world.""

It's unclear what impact the leak will have on the summit between Biden and Moon, which is scheduled for May 21. However, some experts say that the US may need to take steps to rebuild trust with South Korea in order to move forward with its objectives in the region.

""The US will need to work hard to reassure South Korea that it takes their concerns seriously,"" said Panda. ""That may involve taking steps to better protect sensitive information, or it may involve making other gestures to show that the US is a reliable ally.""

Despite the challenges posed by the leak, experts say that the US and South Korea are still likely to find common ground on a range of issues. Both countries are deeply committed to countering the threat from North Korea, and they have worked closely together in the past to address regional security issues.

""The US and South Korea have a strong and enduring alliance,"" said Victor Cha, a former White House official and Korea expert. ""There may be disagreements and setbacks, but the fundamentals of the relationship are strong. I think both sides will be committed to making the summit a success.""

As the US continues to grapple with the fallout from the leak, there are likely to be renewed calls for greater transparency and accountability within the intelligence community. Some experts have called for a review of the procedures and protocols used to handle sensitive information, while others have suggested that more needs to be done to protect whistleblowers who come forward with concerns about wrongdoing.

""The leak is a reminder of the challenges we face when it comes to safeguarding our secrets,"" said Matthew Waxman, a law professor at Columbia University who specializes in national security issues. ""We need to find a way to strike the right balance between protecting sensitive information and ensuring that the public has the information it needs to hold our government accountable."" 

Overall, the leak has added a new layer of complexity to an already complex relationship between the US and its allies in the region. However, experts say that both sides are likely to remain committed to finding ways to work together to promote peace and stability in Northeast Asia.",1
99,"South Floridians mop up, recall fear after historic deluge","MIAMI (AP) — South Floridians mopped up on Monday as they began to deal with the aftermath of a historic, record-breaking weekend deluge that left streets and homes flooded and forced rescue teams to pluck residents from cars and rooftops.

The deadly flooding, which was fueled by a stalled and exceptionally strong low-pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico, caught many residents off guard, despite days of forecast warnings.

“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Miami-Dade County Commissioner Raquel Regalado, who represents parts of the county that were severely flooded. “It’s a disaster.”

The flood, which began in much of the region on Saturday and continued into Sunday, affected most areas of the tri-county South Florida region, including Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.

It knocked out power to tens of thousands of people, caused at least two deaths and prompted some residents to recall Hurricane Wilma in 2005.

“It was like a nightmare,” said Karen Mungia, who lives in Homestead, where streets were so flooded that some cars were submerged up to their roofs.

Mungia recalls being forced to spend the night in her car after driving through a flood-impacted area and becoming stranded. “We thought we’d be safe in our car, but then the water just kept rising and rising.”

Rescue teams were deployed across the region, using boats and helicopters to rescue people from rooftops and stranded vehicles. At least two people died from the flood waters.

“We were expecting rain, but not like this,” said Odion Okezie, a Miami resident who was rescued by first responders after driving into a flood zone.

The rainfall was unprecedented, with some areas reporting more than a foot of rain in just 24 hours. The National Weather Service said the flooding was the result of a “1,000-year rainfall event,” meaning it has a 0.1% chance of occurring in any given year.

“This is not something we typically see in this area,” said Pablo Santos, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Miami. “It’s an extremely rare and dangerous event.”

Forecasters warned that the flooding could continue for several days as water levels in the region’s rivers and canals continued to rise. Many residents were advised to boil their water before using it, as the flood waters had contaminated the region’s water supply.

“It’s going to take a long time for things to get back to normal,” said Regalado. “We need to work together as a community to get through this.”

The deluge has also raised concerns about climate change and the region’s infrastructure, which many say is ill-equipped to handle such extreme weather events.

“South Florida has always been vulnerable to flooding, but this event shows just how unprepared we are for something like this,” said Harold Wanless, a geologist and professor at the University of Miami.

Wanless called for immediate action to improve the region’s infrastructure, including raising homes and buildings above flood zones and improving drainage systems. “We can’t keep ignoring this problem,” he said. “It’s only going to get worse.”

Meanwhile, residents across the region were left to mop up and assess the damage to their homes and businesses. Many streets remained flooded, making it difficult for crews to clear debris and for residents to move around.

“I’ve got water in my house, water in my car, water everywhere,” said Janelle Ortiz, a Fort Lauderdale resident who said the flooding was the worst she had ever seen.

Ortiz said she and her family had spent much of the weekend bailing out their home, trying to protect their possessions from the rising water.

“It’s overwhelming,” she said. “I don’t know where to begin.”

Others were still dealing with the aftermath of flooding on Monday morning, trying to figure out how to get to work or school as roads remained impassable.

“I’m stuck,” said Michael Hernandez, a Miami resident who said he had missed work on Monday because his street was flooded. “There’s no way I’m driving through all that water.”

The flooding has also sparked concerns about the impact on the region’s tourism industry, which relies heavily on visitors from around the world.

“We’re definitely going to see some cancellations,” said Bill Talbert, president and CEO of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. “It’s too soon to tell how big of an impact this will have, but it’s definitely something we’re watching closely.”

Despite the challenges, many residents remained optimistic about the region’s ability to bounce back.

“We’ve been through hurricanes, floods, all kinds of disasters,” said Regalado. “We know how to come together as a community and support each other.”

Regalado said that the region would need help from state and federal officials to recover from the flood. “We need all the resources we can get,” she said. “But I have faith that we’ll get through this.”",1
100,Guardsman arrested in leak of classified military documents,"WASHINGTON (AP) — An Army National Guardsman has been arrested for allegedly leaking classified military documents to an online news outlet, according to court documents released on Monday.

Sgt. First Class Jacob M. Raines, 32, of Franklin, Tennessee, was taken into custody on Friday and charged with one count of unauthorized disclosure of national defense information.

The Department of Justice said in a statement that Raines allegedly provided the documents to a reporter with an online news outlet in March 2021. The documents were deemed classified at the secret level, according to the statement.

The online news outlet, whose name was not released in the court documents, published a series of articles based on the documents earlier this year, according to the Justice Department. The articles contained details about U.S. military operations in the Middle East.

The arrest is the latest in a series of high-profile cases involving leaks of classified information in recent years.

The Justice Department said in its statement that Raines was allowed access to the classified documents in his capacity as an intelligence analyst with the Army National Guard.

The statement did not provide any details about Raines' motive for allegedly leaking the documents.

""Disclosure of classified information can compromise national security interests and puts our personnel and operations at risk,"" Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers said in the statement. ""The Department of Justice will continue to aggressively pursue and hold accountable those who violate their oaths to protect classified information.""

The Justice Department said Raines faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

It was not immediately clear if Raines had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.

The National Guard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest.

The leaking of classified information has been a controversial issue in recent years, with some arguing that the public has a right to know about government actions that affect their lives.

However, the government has argued that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information can pose a threat to national security and compromise the safety of military personnel and operations.

President Joe Biden has taken a tough stance on leaks of classified information, according to a recent report by Politico. The report cited anonymous sources who said that Biden has instructed his staff to pursue leakers aggressively and to refer any cases to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.

The report also said that the Biden administration has been cracking down on leaks in the early months of his presidency, with several high-profile cases already underway.

Last month, the Justice Department charged a former intelligence analyst with leaking classified information to a reporter with The Intercept. The analyst, Daniel Hale, was taken into custody in Nashville, Tennessee, and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Hale's leak, which was published by The Intercept in 2015, revealed details about the U.S. government's drone program and the killing of civilians in Yemen.

The Intercept has been involved in other high-profile cases involving leaks of classified information, including the publication of documents provided by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.

Snowden, who now lives in Russia to avoid prosecution in the United States, has been charged with espionage and theft of government property.

The leaking of classified information has also been a major topic of debate in recent years in the context of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Several officials in the Trump administration were accused of disclosing classified information to the media in order to damage political opponents.

In 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reports that detailed the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the government's response to it. The reports were based on classified material and were widely praised for their bipartisan approach to a contentious issue.

The leaking of classified information is a serious offense that can have significant consequences for both the individual responsible and the national security of the United States.

As the case against Sgt. Raines continues to develop, it is sure to reignite debate about the role of whistleblowers in a democratic society and the balance between public disclosure and government secrecy.",1
101,"Drought will cause crop failures in Spain, farmers warn","MADRID (AP) — Farmers in Spain are warning of crop failures as the country experiences an extended period of drought, causing concern for the country's agricultural industry.

With rainfall levels far below average for this time of year, Spanish farmers are struggling to grow crops and have warned that the damage could last for years to come.

""We are extremely concerned about the situation,"" said Luis Planas, Spain’s Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. ""Without rainfall, our farmers are unable to grow the crops they need to stay in business.""

According to Spain's meteorological agency, the country has experienced over 50% less rainfall than average over the last few months. The regions of Andalucia, Valenciana, and Murcia have been hit the hardest, with farmers in these areas reporting significant crop losses.

Luciano Cantos, a farmer from the southern province of Jaen, said that he had lost much of his crop of wheat, olives, and almonds. ""We've had barely any rainfall this year, and it's devastating for our crops,"" he said. ""The dryness has caused the soil to become infertile, meaning that the plants cannot grow.""

The situation is worsened by the fact that Spain is one of the driest countries in Europe, with its water shortage already considered critical. The country only has around 5% of the continent's water supply, yet accounts for around 15% of its agricultural production.

""The situation in Spain is unsustainable,"" said Eduardo Esteve, an expert in rural development at the University of Valencia. ""The country has some of the most fertile land in Europe, but without adequate rainfall, the crops can't grow.""

Spain's agricultural sector is critical to the country's economy, accounting for around 2.5% of GDP and employing over 2 million people. Experts warn that the current dry spell could lead to a significant reduction in agricultural output, with knock-on effects for jobs and the wider economy.

""The impact of this drought will be felt far beyond the farmgate,"" said Esteve. ""Many farmers are smallholders who rely on their crops to make a living. If they can't sell their produce, they'll go out of business. This will not only hurt the farmers themselves but will also impact the wider economy.""

The Spanish government has announced measures to help agricultural producers, including loans and tax breaks for those affected by the drought. However, farmers argue that these measures are not enough to compensate for the losses they have suffered.

""The losses we've seen this year will have a long-term impact on our business,"" said Cantos. ""We need meaningful support from the government to help us get back on our feet.""

Experts warn that the impact of the drought could be felt for years to come, with many farmers already struggling to secure enough water to irrigate their crops. The lack of rainfall has also led to an increase in wildfires, which farmers say pose a further risk to their fields and crops.

Despite the challenges, some farmers remain optimistic, saying that they are adapting to the new climate reality in Spain.

""We're looking at ways to use less water and grow crops that are more drought-resistant,"" said Cantos. ""We know that we're in for a tough few years, but we're determined to make it work.""

However, as the drought continues, many farmers are left hoping for rainfall and a change in the country's fortunes.

""It's a difficult situation,"" said Planas. ""We're doing everything we can to support our farmers, but ultimately we need rain to come and save our crops.""",1
102,Students' 1976 bicentennial mural on dam being replaced,"The students of West Jessamine Middle School in Nicholasville, Kentucky, painted a mural on a concrete retaining wall of nearby dam back in 1976 as part of the country's bicentennial celebrations. The colorful mural, featuring patriotic and historical scenes, has been a beloved landmark for the community ever since.

However, after 45 years, the mural is starting to fade and crack, and the concrete wall itself is showing signs of wear and tear. As a result, the Jessamine County Water District has decided to replace the dam and the retaining wall, which means the iconic mural will have to go.

Some members of the community are disappointed by the news, as the mural has been a source of pride for the area for decades. However, the water district assures residents that they will work with local officials to come up with a suitable replacement for the mural.

The new dam and retaining wall will not only ensure the safety and reliability of the local water supply, but it will also provide an opportunity to create a new landmark that reflects the community's identity and values.",1
103,Justice Department appeals Texas abortion pill order,"The Justice Department has filed an appeal against a recent injunction order issued by a federal judge in Texas, blocking access to abortive pills, effectively halting abortion procedures in the state. The move by the DOJ, supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seeks to overturn the ruling by Judge Lee Yeakel that restricted the use of mifepristone, a medication used in medication-induced abortions.

The injunction order was issued earlier this month by Judge Yeakel in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), demanding that they enforce regulations on the use of mifepristone that have been in place since 2016. The court order prevented doctors from prescribing the drug to women seeking abortions after seven weeks of pregnancy, effectively making medication abortions impossible in the state.

Pro-choice advocates immediately condemned the decision, saying it would put the health and safety of women at risk. The Texas abortion law, they argued, would push women towards more dangerous and illegal methods, which would further deplete the already insufficient healthcare resources available in the state. The DOJ's filing has buoyed the pro-choice movement, who see it as a definitive step towards reversing the injunction and restoring women's reproductive rights.

“We welcome the DOJ's decision to appeal this unjust and unconstitutional law,” said Nancy Northup, president, and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. “By seeking to suppress access to safe and legal abortion, Texas is endangering the lives and health of countless women. This appeal affirms that the administration is committed to protecting the rights of women and ensuring that they have access to the healthcare they need and deserve.”

The Justice Department, in its filing, said that the injunction order violated the constitutional rights of women in the state by forcing them to carry their pregnancies to term, even if it put their health and lives at risk. The filing also argued that the Texas abortion law was arbitrary and capricious, as it singled out mifepristone, while ignoring other drugs with similar risks and benefits.

“The district court's injunction is an unwarranted intrusion into the FDA's regulatory regime, which has been in place for more than two decades and is supported by substantial evidence,” the Justice Department said in its appeal. “The district court's order imposes significant and irreversible harm on patients, health care providers, and the public interest.”

The decision by the DOJ to appeal the ruling comes at a crucial moment for reproductive rights in the country. The Supreme Court is currently scheduled to hear arguments in December on a Mississippi case that could overturn or severely restrict the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the US. The case has become a rallying point for conservative and pro-life groups who hope to ban abortions altogether.

The Biden administration has made it a priority to uphold reproductive rights and expand access to healthcare for women. Last week, the FDA announced that it would review its policies on mifepristone and other drugs used in medication abortions, with a view to potentially lifting some of the restrictions in place. The move was welcomed by pro-choice advocates, who saw it as a positive step towards reversing the Texas abortion law and other restrictive measures in states across the country.

However, the fight for reproductive rights is far from over. In addition to the Supreme Court case, several other states have passed or are considering restrictive abortion laws that could set back decades of progress. The Texas abortion law, in particular, has become a lightning rod for controversy, with both sides of the debate arguing fiercely over its constitutionality and morality.

For now, the appeal filed by the Justice Department offers a glimmer of hope for those fighting for reproductive freedom. The ruling in Texas, if left unchallenged, could have far-reaching implications for women's health and rights, not just in the state but across the country. With the Supreme Court poised to make a historic decision on abortion, the outcome of the appeal could have a significant impact on the lives of millions of women in America.",1
104,Italy vows help with IMF in bid to stabilize Tunisia,"Italy has pledged to provide assistance to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its efforts to stabilize Tunisia's economy, which has been reeling from political unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The announcement was made by Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio during a meeting with Tunisian Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi in Tunis on Monday.

""We are ready to support the International Monetary Fund in the process of stabilizing Tunisia, which is a fundamental country for the Mediterranean and for Italy,"" Di Maio said.

He added that Italy was also prepared to provide assistance in the areas of energy, infrastructure, and tourism, as well as in the fight against illegal immigration.

The statement came as the IMF welcomed Tunisia's moves to implement a series of economic reforms aimed at restoring confidence in the country's economy, which has been hit hard by political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Economic growth in Tunisia has been sluggish for years, with high levels of youth unemployment and widespread poverty leading to widespread protests and social unrest.

In July, the IMF approved a $4 billion loan to Tunisia to help the country tackle its economic challenges, including lowering its budget deficit, reining in inflation, and improving the business environment.

The Tunisian government has been implementing a series of economic reforms, including reducing subsidies on consumer goods, tightening public spending, and strengthening the banking sector.

The country is also seeking to boost investment and tourism while reducing its dependence on foreign borrowing.

However, some Tunisians have criticized the government's economic policies, saying that they have hurt the most vulnerable members of society.

The latest announcement from Italy comes as the country seeks to strengthen its ties with Tunisia, which is seen as a key partner in the Mediterranean region.

Italy has long considered Tunisia an important partner in the region, given the countries' shared cultural and economic heritage.

Tunisia is also a major transit country for migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, and Italy has been among the countries providing aid to Tunisia to help combat illegal migration.

Italy has been one of Tunisia's main trading partners for years, with many Italian companies active in the country's tourism, energy, and construction sectors.

The announcement of Italy's support for the IMF's efforts to stabilize Tunisia's economy will be welcomed by both Tunisian and Italian government officials, as well as by investors and businesses operating in the country.

However, it remains to be seen whether the IMF's loan package and Tunisian government reforms will be enough to bring about sustained economic growth and stability in the country.",1
105,Lana Del Rey's 'Ocean Blvd' is an intimate epic,"Lana Del Rey's latest album, 'Ocean Blvd', has been making waves amongst fans and critics alike. The pop star's trademark vintage aesthetic, smokey vocals and haunting lyrics are all present in this collection of songs, but what sets it apart is its intimacy.

Despite being packed with widescreen, grandiose moments of sound, 'Ocean Blvd' feels like a deeply personal affair. Del Rey's lyrics are filled with confessions of heartbreak, self-doubt and emotional turmoil. The album is a meditation on love, loss and the quest for self-discovery.

One of the standout tracks on the album is 'Dark Paradise', in which Del Rey sings about finding comfort in the darkness. The song is carried by a stirring string section and Del Rey's layered harmonies, which build to a stunning crescendo. It's a sweeping, cinematic moment that feels like it belongs in a classic Hollywood film.

But 'Ocean Blvd' isn't all melancholy ballads. The album has plenty of upbeat moments too, such as the infectious 'Dancing in the Dark', which features a pulsing beat and a catchy chorus that will have listeners tapping their feet. The song is a celebration of living in the moment and finding joy in the simple things in life.

Another standout track is 'The Sound of Silence', a stripped-down ballad that showcases Del Rey's impressive vocal range. The song builds slowly, with delicate piano and guitar accompaniment, before exploding into a powerful chorus. It's a poignant reflection on the perils of loneliness and the struggle to connect with others.

The album closes with 'Venice Bitch', an epic, nine-minute odyssey that showcases Del Rey's songwriting skills at their best. The song ebbs and flows, moving from sparse, introspective moments to explosive choruses filled with distorted guitar riffs and pounding drums. The lyrics are a stream-of-consciousness meditation on love, pain and the search for meaning in life.

Overall, 'Ocean Blvd' is a triumph for Lana Del Rey. The album feels like a true labour of love, with every song carefully crafted and imbued with emotion. The album is a journey through Del Rey's psyche, and listeners will feel like they've been taken on a journey themselves by the time the final notes of 'Venice Bitch' fade away.

Fans of Del Rey will find plenty to love in 'Ocean Blvd', but the album is also likely to attract new listeners with its unique blend of intimacy and grandiosity. It's a rare album that manages to be both deeply personal and epic in scope, and it's clear that Del Rey poured her heart and soul into creating something truly special.

In conclusion, if you're in the mood for an emotional rollercoaster of an album that will leave you feeling both uplifted and introspective, 'Ocean Blvd' is the perfect choice. Lana Del Rey has truly outdone herself with this latest offering, and it's clear that she's one of the most talented songwriters and performers of our time.",1
106,"Senegal struggles with loss of fish central to diet, culture","Recently, Senegal has been facing a major crisis - the loss of their fish supply. Fish is a central part of Senegal's diet and culture, and the dwindling fish stocks are causing significant concerns to the Senegalese people.

For centuries, fishing has been the backbone of Senegal's economy. However, in recent years, the once-abundant fish supply has started to decline. This is due to several factors, including overfishing and illegal fishing practices, environmental degradation and climate change. This decline has had a major impact on Senegal's economy, with many fishermen now struggling to make a living.

Moreover, fish is a staple food in Senegal, with many families relying on it for their daily meals. However, with the decline in fish supply, the price of fish has skyrocketed, making it difficult for many Senegalese people to afford this vital food source. This has led to a rise in malnutrition and health problems, particularly among children.

""This is a serious problem. It's affecting not only the fishermen, but also the entire population,"" said Mamadou Sally, a fisherman in Senegal. ""We used to catch fish easily, but now it's becoming more and more difficult. We need the government to take action to protect our fish stocks and ensure that we can continue to fish for generations to come.""

The loss of fish has also had cultural implications for Senegal. Fish plays a significant role in Senegal's culture, with many traditional dishes featuring fish as the main ingredient. Some Senegalese fear that the loss of fish could lead to a loss of cultural identity.

""There is a strong connection between fish and our culture,"" said Mariama Diallo, a Senegalese community leader. ""Fish is part of our identity as Senegalese people, and if we lose it, we lose a part of ourselves.""

To address the crisis, Senegal's government has been implementing various measures to protect fish stocks. For example, they have imposed stricter regulations on fishing practices, including banning certain types of fishing gear and enforcing catch limits. They have also engaged with local communities to promote sustainable fishing practices.

However, these efforts have faced challenges, specifically in terms of illegal fishing practices that continue to persist. The government has recognized that more needs to be done to tackle the issue, and they have pledged to redouble their efforts to protect fish stocks and promote sustainable fishing practices.

The loss of fish in Senegal has had far-reaching consequences, and the government's efforts to address the crisis are essential to preserve this vital food source and cultural identity. While the challenges are significant, there is hope that through collaboration and action, Senegal can overcome this crisis and ensure a sustainable future for their fish stocks and the communities that depend on them.",1
107,Emmanuel Macron says his position on Taiwan is unchanged,"French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his position on Taiwan during a recent interview with French newspaper Le Point. Macron stated that although he recognizes China's sovereignty over Taiwan, he believes it is important to maintain ties with the island nation.

Macron's comments come amid increasing tensions between China and Taiwan. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, but Taiwan has been governed separately since then. China has recently stepped up pressure on Taiwan, including a series of military exercises and diplomatic efforts to isolate Taiwan on the global stage.

Macron's position on Taiwan is not new. He previously expressed support for maintaining dialogue and exchanges with Taiwan during a joint press conference with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in 2019. However, his latest comments provide a reminder of France's stance on the Taiwan issue.

France, like most countries, does not officially recognize Taiwan as a separate state, but it maintains unofficial ties with the island nation. France and Taiwan have cultural and economic ties, with France a major supplier of military equipment to Taiwan.

Macron's stance on Taiwan is in line with his broader approach to foreign policy. He has emphasized the importance of maintaining dialogue and engagement with all countries, including those with whom France may have differences. This approach has been particularly evident in his efforts to maintain dialogue with Russia, despite tensions between Russia and many Western countries.

Macron's comments on Taiwan also highlight the challenges of maintaining a balance in relations with China. France, like many other countries, wants to maintain economic ties with China, which is an important market for French businesses. At the same time, France and other countries are concerned about China's human rights record, its territorial ambitions, and its influence on the global stage.

Taiwan is a particularly sensitive issue for China, which considers it a part of its territory. China has used its economic and diplomatic leverage to pressure countries to curtail ties with Taiwan. Many countries have complied for fear of angering China and losing access to its markets.

However, some countries have continued to maintain ties with Taiwan despite pressure from China. This includes the United States, which has increased support for Taiwan in recent years. The United States has sold military equipment to Taiwan and has increased official contacts with Taiwanese officials.

The issue of Taiwan is likely to continue to be a source of tension between China and other countries, particularly those with close ties to the United States. As China's power and influence continue to grow, many countries will need to find ways to balance their economic interests with their concerns about human rights and territorial disputes.

France's position on Taiwan is a reminder that maintaining dialogue and engagement with all countries is important, even if it may not always be easy. The challenges of managing relations with China will require careful diplomacy and a willingness to stand up for values such as human rights and democracy.

Macron's statement on Taiwan may not change the global political landscapes, but it certainly sends a signal to the international community that Macron's France is determined in maintaining an even-handed approach to global affairs. It would also pave the way for closer political ties with Taiwan, a country which has been largely isolated on the global stage citing the heavy hand of China.

The French President's stance is also significant as it could influence other European countries to follow suit and recognise the sovereignty of Taiwan, in defiance of pressure from Beijing. Despite being a small economy, Taiwan has persistently shown a commitment to democracy and human rights, proving to be an important ally for Western countries in the Asia-Pacific region.",1
108,"Joe O'Biden? In Ireland, president wonders why anyone leaves","DUBLIN (AP) — Standing beside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle, Joe Biden marveled at the natural beauty surrounding him.

“This looks like a goddamn John Hinde postcard!” exclaimed the former U.S. vice president, referring to the famous Irish photographer whose colorful images of Ireland helped draw a generation of tourists.

“I don’t know why anybody would leave this place,” Biden added.

It was a sentiment many here share: Why would anyone choose to leave Ireland, with its stunning landscapes, vibrant cities, rich culture and people known for their wit and warmth?

Of course, many do leave, for reasons ranging from economic necessity to adventure-seeking. And many more have left in the past, often leaving wounds that have yet to fully heal.

For Biden, the trip to Ireland was personal as well as political. The 76-year-old said he was retracing the roots of his family, which includes a great-great-grandfather who left Ireland in 1849 — the middle of the Great Famine — and a great-grandfather who was a Belfast-born captain in the U.S. Army.

Biden said he sees much of himself in the Irish, from their tradition of storytelling to their “unrelenting optimism and confidence in the face of adversity” — qualities that he said have carried him through his own personal struggles, including the deaths of his first wife and two children.

“I made the decision to be back today to honor my forebears, but also to recognize that the ties that bind us are so real,” Biden told a crowd of several hundred people gathered in the castle’s courtyard.

Biden’s visit comes as Ireland, like many countries in Europe, is grappling with political and economic turmoil. Britain’s pending departure from the European Union has raised questions about the economic future of both countries, and a recent referendum to repeal Ireland’s ban on abortion exposed deep divides over social issues.

But perhaps nowhere are the wounds of the past more raw than in Northern Ireland, where decades of sectarian violence between Protestants and Catholics left more than 3,500 dead and countless more injured and traumatized.

Varadkar, who is gay and the son of an Irish mother and Indian father, praised Biden for his work in helping to broker peace in Northern Ireland, saying he had earned the nickname “Biden the Peacemaker.”

“I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that he made a real contribution to the peace process here,” Varadkar said.

Biden, for his part, called the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 — a landmark peace accord that brought an end to decades of violence in Northern Ireland — “one of the great achievements of modern diplomacy.”

But he also noted that the work is not yet done. Biden called for a restoration of the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, which has been suspended since January 2017, and urged both sides to bridge their differences.

“While the peace is fragile, it is also real,” he said. “But it’s not irreversible. It must be constantly nurtured and renewed.”

Biden also drew parallels between the struggles of Northern Ireland and those facing the U.S. today, including deep political divisions and a president who often seems more focused on sowing discord than bridging differences.

He criticized President Donald Trump’s recent attacks on London Mayor Sadiq Khan, saying they were “frankly outrageous and disheartening to watch.” And he spoke of the need for leaders to reach across political divides and find common ground.

“We need those hat-in-hand moments when we reach across the aisle and recognize that our opponents are not our enemies,” Biden said. “They’re our competitors. They’re our colleagues.”

Despite the challenges facing Northern Ireland and the U.S. today, Biden struck a hopeful note, saying he remains optimistic about the future.

“I believe with every fiber of my being that we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation and that we will prevail,” he said. “And I believe with every fiber of my being that peace, in Northern Ireland and in the world, is possible.”

Biden’s trip to Ireland also included stops in his ancestral hometowns of Ballina and Louth, where he was greeted by cheering crowds and serenaded with traditional Irish music.

In Ballina, he visited St. Murdach’s Cathedral, where his great-great-grandparents are buried, and met with distant relatives who still live in the area.

“It’s been a great honor to be here,” he told one group, adding that he was inspired by the “indomitable spirit” of the Irish people.

Biden also visited the County Louth village of Carlingford, where his great-great-grandfather was born, and met with local residents, including a group of schoolchildren who sang “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.”

Biden was visibly moved by the experience, calling it “one of the most emotional moments of my life.”

“It’s really touched my heart,” he said of the warm welcome he received. “I’m proud to be a son of this place.”

As Biden prepared to depart Dublin, he offered some final thoughts on the lessons he had learned during his trip.

“I think what we’ve learned is that the ties that bind us — the shared history, culture, language, heritage and values — are far more powerful and enduring than anything that could divide us,” he said.

“And I think that’s something that’s worth remembering not just in Ireland, but in every corner of the world.”",1
109,Sudan's military warns of conflict after rival force deploys,"Sudan's military has warned of potential conflict after a rival security force deployed in parts of the capital, Khartoum. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group linked to former President Omar al-Bashir, has reportedly taken control of some areas, raising fears of violence in the country.

The RSF, which is also known as the Janjaweed, has a history of violence towards civilians and has been accused of war crimes in the Darfur region. It was integrated into the Sudanese military after al-Bashir's ouster in 2019, but many fear it remains loyal to the former leader, who led the country for 30 years.

Sudan has been in a fragile state since the ouster of al-Bashir in 2019, with a transitional government set up to oversee a shift towards democracy. However, tensions remain between the military and civilian factions, with the RSF seen as an extension of the former.

The deployment of the RSF comes after clashes between the military and civilian forces in recent weeks. Protesters have been calling for the military to hand over power to civilian authorities, while the military has accused pro-democracy groups of interfering in politics.

The United Nations has expressed concern over the latest developments, with Sudan's UN ambassador warning of the risk of civil war. ""The situation is very uncertain and unstable, there is a risk of a full-scale civil war,"" said Ambassador Omar Siddig.

The US has also called for calm, urging all parties to refrain from violence. ""We urge an immediate cessation of all violence and call on all parties to peacefully resolve their differences through dialogue,"" said a statement from the US State Department.

The deployment of the RSF has been met with resistance from some Sudanese, with reports of protests in Khartoum. The possibility of clashes between the RSF and civilians raises concerns over the potential for a wider conflict.

Sudan is already facing a number of challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, economic struggles, and ongoing tensions surrounding the construction of a dam on the Nile River. The latest developments add to the uncertainty in the country and could potentially derail progress towards democracy.

The international community has called for a peaceful resolution to the situation, with the African Union expressing concern over the deployment of the RSF. ""This development comes at a critical juncture in Sudan's transition and undermines the ongoing efforts towards the consolidation of the gains made,"" said Moussa Faki, the chairman of the African Union Commission.

The UN has also called for restraint, with spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric urging all parties to ""engage in dialogue to resolve their differences and address the challenges facing Sudan.""

The latest developments in Sudan highlight the challenges facing countries during periods of transition. The transition to democracy is never easy, and in Sudan's case, the military's reluctance to give up power appears to be a major stumbling block.

The RSF's deployment will only serve to heighten tensions in the country, and its violent history raises serious concerns over the potential for conflict. Sudan's civilians deserve a peaceful transition to democracy, and the international community should do all it can to ensure that happens.

It is now up to Sudan's military and civilian leaders to work together to find a solution to the crisis, and to ensure that the country's fragile transition towards democracy remains on track. The deployment of the RSF is a worrying development, and it is up to all parties to ensure that their actions do not lead to further violence or instability.",1
110,Why a 21-year-old has been arrested in document leak probe,"New York, USA - A 21-year-old woman has been arrested as part of a probe into document leaks from a prominent law firm. The woman, whose name has not been released, is accused of stealing confidential documents from the law firm and allegedly passing them on to a media outlet.

The documents, which are believed to contain sensitive information about several high-powered clients, were first published by the media outlet earlier this month. The leak has caused major embarrassment to the law firm and its clients, and has also sparked concerns about the security of confidential information.

According to the authorities, the woman was apprehended in her home state of Georgia and is currently being held without bail. She is facing charges of computer intrusion, theft of trade secrets, and transmission of stolen documents. If convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.

The case highlights the risks associated with the increasingly digital nature of information sharing. Every day, sensitive information is stored and transmitted electronically, making it vulnerable to cyber attacks and other security breaches. In this case, it appears that the woman was able to access confidential information from the law firm by exploiting weaknesses in their computer systems.

""This case is a reminder that even the most sophisticated organizations can fall victim to cyber criminals,"" said cyber security expert Scott Larsen. ""Companies need to be vigilant about protecting their sensitive information, and that starts with regular assessments of their IT infrastructure and security protocols.""

It is not yet clear why the woman targeted this particular law firm, or how she was able to gain access to their confidential data. However, there are several possible motives for document leaks like this. Some people may be motivated by a desire to punish wrongdoing or expose unethical behavior. Others may be seeking to profit from the sale of confidential information to rival companies or media outlets.

The woman's arrest is likely to send shockwaves through the legal industry, where client confidentiality is considered sacrosanct. Law firms and other professional services organizations are likely to place even greater emphasis on cyber security and data protection in the wake of this incident.

""As law firms continue to transition to digital systems, they must ensure that their security measures are up to date and that employees are adequately trained to detect and respond to cyber threats,"" said Jim Leipold, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement. ""It is essential that confidential client information is protected at all times.""

The leak has already had significant consequences for the law firm and its clients. Several clients have reportedly terminated their relationships with the firm in the wake of the incident, and there are likely to be legal and financial implications for both the firm and the individuals whose information was compromised.

As the authorities continue their investigation into the document leak, they will undoubtedly be looking to identify any other individuals who may have been involved in the theft of the confidential data. The case serves as a stark reminder of the serious consequences of cyber crime and the importance of robust data protection measures.

""Data breaches can have major economic and reputational consequences for companies and organizations,"" said Larsen. ""It is incumbent upon all businesses to take proactive steps to safeguard their sensitive information and protect themselves from cyber threats.""",1
111,Fox attorneys in libel case reveal dual roles for Murdoch,"NEW YORK (AP) — Attorneys for Fox News argued in a libel case that media mogul Rupert Murdoch has dual roles as chairman of both News Corp and Fox Corp, and that therefore allegations against Fox News should be attributed to News Corp.

The lawsuit, filed by the parents of slain Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, alleges that comments made on Fox News linking their son's death to the leak of DNC emails during the 2016 presidential election were baseless and caused emotional distress. The theory put forward by some conservative pundits and politicians that Rich was killed in connection with the emails has been widely discredited and condemned.

During a hearing on Wednesday, attorney for Fox News, Guy Petrillo, argued that because Murdoch occupies the role of chairman at both News Corp and Fox Corp, it is inaccurate to refer to Fox News as a separate entity. Petrillo said that any alleged defamatory statements made by Fox News should be attributed to News Corp, rather than Fox News itself.

Petrillo stated that “There is no separate editorial board for Fox News, and there has never been”. He further added that the allegation was made on a news show that aired on Fox News in 2017, but that the actual words came from a Foxnews.com story before the TV program.

Alan Gershenfeld, the attorney for Rich's parents, countered that ""Fox News has a separate existence and identity from News Corp, which is a completely separate company.""

Gershenfeld argued that even if Murdoch is the chairman of both companies, they operate independently and that blaming News Corp for Fox News' actions would be like holding the parent company of a defamatory website accountable for its posts.

The judge presiding over the case, George Daniels, questioned whether the relationship between News Corp and Fox News was similar to that of a parent and subsidiary, or more akin to a holding company.

""I think the structure is really more than just a parent-subsidiary relationship,"" Petrillo said in response. ""I think it's a relationship of common ownership and control.""

In response, Gershenfeld stated that “There's no bright-line test to determine the level of control that Rupert Murdoch has over Fox News, but I think it's clear that he doesn't control it personally, and it operates independently, as an arm of the Fox Corp.”

The legal strategy of Fox News is not surprising considering the company has been dealing with numerous legal challenges and controversies over the years. These include lawsuits filed by former employees alleging sexual misconduct and discrimination, and criticism of their coverage of the 2020 United States presidential election. Additionally, following the January 6th riots at the US Capitol, Fox News saw a significant decrease in ratings and backlash from advertisers.

The lawsuit brought by the parents of Seth Rich is just another example of the legal challenges that have been faced by Fox News. It is also a reminder that the theory of Rich's murder being connected to the DNC email leaks has been debunked. In 2018, the Rich family filed a lawsuit against Fox News alleging the network fabricated the story about Rich's death. The lawsuit was dropped in 2019.

It is unclear how Judge Daniels will rule in the current case. However, the legal arguments presented on Wednesday are likely to have broader implications for the media industry. The issue of ownership and control within media companies is often a matter of speculation, but the dual roles of Rupert Murdoch as chairman for both News Corp and Fox Corp highlight the need for greater transparency.

In a statement released after the hearing, a spokesperson for News Corp said that ""Fox News operates independently under the editorial control of its leadership team"" and that ""while Rupert Murdoch serves as Chairman of both News Corp and Fox Corp, the two entities operate as separate and distinct companies.""

The spokesperson added that ""We are confident the court will see through this latest attempt by the Rich family to stifle free speech and undermine the credibility of Fox News and its journalists.""

It remains to be seen what the outcome of the case will be, but the role of Rupert Murdoch in the current legal dispute highlights the need for greater clarity in terms of media ownership and control. If Fox News is found to be responsible for defamatory statements made on its network, it could have far-reaching implications for the media industry as a whole. The issue of responsibility and accountability within media organizations is likely to become increasingly important in the years ahead.",1
112,Expelled Black lawmaker Pearson to return to Tennessee House,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A black Tennessee lawmaker who was expelled from the state's House of Representatives last year is set to return to the chamber after winning his lawsuit against the expulsion.

Representative Jeremy Durham, who has been fighting his expulsion since it happened last September, was the only member of the General Assembly removed from office by his colleagues in 36 years.

But now, Durham is set to return to the House, after a judge ruled that his expulsion was unconstitutional, and ordered the state to pay his legal fees.

The ruling has sparked controversy in the Tennessee political scene, with some lawmakers questioning whether Durham's return will be beneficial to the state.

""He was expelled for a reason,"" said Representative Bill Dunn, a Republican who voted in favor of the expulsion. ""I don't know what the future holds, but I don't think it's going to be good for the image of the House.""

Durham's expulsion came after a series of allegations against him, including sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior towards women. An investigation by the state's attorney general found that Durham had engaged in inappropriate conduct, including sexting interns and making sexually suggestive comments about female staff members.

But Durham has maintained his innocence, and has accused his colleagues of conducting a politically motivated campaign against him.

""They expelled me because they didn't like my politics,"" Durham told reporters after the ruling. ""They didn't like that I was a conservative and that I stood up for my principles.""

Durham's supporters say that his reinstatement is a victory for free speech and due process.

""He was never given a fair hearing, and his rights were violated,"" said Representative G.A. Hardaway, a Democrat who supported Durham's lawsuit. ""This is a triumph for democracy and the rule of law.""

Durham's case has also revived concerns about the lack of transparency in the state's legislative process. Tennessee's constitution does not provide for a public hearing or appeal process for expelled lawmakers, leaving the decision entirely in the hands of their colleagues.

Some lawmakers are now calling for a constitutional amendment to provide for due process and transparency in the event of an expulsion.

""This is a wake-up call for our state,"" said Representative John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat who has proposed a constitutional amendment on the issue. ""We need to ensure that every lawmaker is given a fair chance to defend themselves.""

Despite the controversy surrounding his return, Durham says he is ready to get back to work in the House.

""I'm looking forward to representing my district again,"" he said. ""I want to get back to work on the issues that matter to Tennesseans, like creating jobs, reducing taxes, and improving our schools.""

Durham's district, which covers parts of Williamson and Maury counties in southern Tennessee, is one of the most conservative in the state. He was first elected to the House in 2008.

Durham's return to the House is likely to be a contentious issue in the upcoming legislative session. Lawmakers will have to decide whether to accept the court's ruling and allow Durham back into the House, or whether to fight the decision and risk further legal action.

Regardless of what happens, Durham's case has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in the state's legislative process.

""The fact that lawmakers can be expelled without a public hearing or appeal is a serious problem,"" said Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee. ""We need to ensure that all lawmakers are treated fairly and that the process is transparent and accountable to the public.""

Durham is one of only a handful of lawmakers in the United States to be expelled from their state's legislature in recent years. In 2018, a Republican lawmaker in Missouri was expelled from the House after being accused of sexual harassment and financial misconduct. And in 2015, a Democratic lawmaker in Illinois was expelled after being charged with bribery.

Despite the controversy surrounding his return, Durham says he is determined to move forward and serve his constituents.

""I'm not going to let this hold me back,"" he said. ""I'm going to keep fighting for the people of my district, and I'm going to keep fighting for what I believe in.""",1
113,Juul Labs agrees to pay $462 million settlement to 6 states,"Juul Labs, the popular e-cigarette company, has agreed to pay $462 million to settle lawsuits filed by six U.S. states over allegations that the company marketed its products to minors.

The settlement, announced on Tuesday, comes after a multi-year investigation and legal battle between Juul and the states of California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

The lawsuits accused Juul of creating a public health crisis by promoting its products to underage users through targeted advertising and social media campaigns. The company was also accused of downplaying the risks of addiction and other health problems associated with vaping.

As part of the settlement, Juul will be required to make substantial changes to its marketing practices, including a ban on advertising to minors and the use of influencers who are under 28 years old. The company will also have to submit all of its marketing materials to an independent review board for approval.

Additionally, Juul will be required to contribute $100 million each year for the next five years towards programs aimed at preventing underage e-cigarette use and helping users quit.

In a statement, Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite said the settlement was a ""critical step forward"" for the company and its efforts to ""reset the vapor category.""

""We must reset our company and our industry and we have taken action to do so,"" he said. ""We remain focused on earning trust through action and are committed to supporting category-wide actions that seek to curb underage use.""

The settlement is the latest in a series of legal challenges for Juul, which has faced intense scrutiny from regulators and public health officials over its role in the youth vaping epidemic. In recent years, hundreds of cases of lung injuries and even deaths have been linked to the use of e-cigarette products.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration announced a ban on flavored e-cigarette products in an effort to curb youth use. The ban was later overturned by a federal judge, but some states have implemented their own restrictions on flavored vaping products.

Critics of Juul say the settlement is a necessary step but does not go far enough to address the harms caused by the company's products.

""Juul has knowingly and intentionally targeted young people with their addictive products, and this settlement is a good start towards holding them accountable,"" said Vince Willmore, a spokesperson for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ""But settlements like this will not fully address the public health crisis that Juul has created.""

Others have criticized the settlement for not doing enough to hold individual executives and shareholders accountable for the company's harmful practices.

The settlement comes just weeks after the finalization of a $26 billion settlement between several major tobacco companies and state governments over the public health costs of smoking. That settlement, which was announced in 1998, was the largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history.

The Juul settlement is still subject to court approval and is expected to take several months to finalize.",1
114,Amazon's $1.7B iRobot purchase faces UK antitrust scrutiny,"Amazon's proposed $1.7 billion purchase of robotics firm, iRobot, is facing scrutiny in the UK. The country's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced on Monday that it will investigate the deal to determine if it violates antitrust laws.

The acquisition, which was announced in March, would give Amazon access to iRobot's technology, including its popular Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner. The move would also put Amazon in direct competition with iRobot's current partners, including Google and Apple.

Iain Mansfield, a director at the CMA, said in a statement, ""We will be investigating whether Amazon's proposed acquisition of iRobot could lead to a substantial lessening of competition and whether this could be detrimental to consumers.""

The CMA's investigation is expected to take several months to complete. If the regulator determines that the deal does violate antitrust laws, it could impose conditions on the acquisition or block it altogether.

This is not the first time Amazon has faced antitrust scrutiny in the UK. Last year, the company's bid to purchase Deliveroo was delayed for several months while the CMA investigated the potential impact on competition in the food delivery market.",1
115,UNC students protest decision to ban 'Cop City' activist,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — Students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill protested on Wednesday after the university decided to ban an activist affiliated with the “Cop City” movement from speaking on campus.

The decision to bar the activist, who has not been identified, from speaking at UNC has sparked controversy, with students and community members arguing that it is a violation of free speech.

The activist, who is known for their work advocating for the defunding of police departments, was invited to speak on campus as part of a series of events organized by a student group.

But the university’s decision to cancel the event, citing “security concerns,” has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups and activists who say the move is an attempt to silence dissenting voices.

In a statement, UNC said that it had “received credible threats of violence” related to the event and was “unable to ensure the safety of everyone attending.”

“The safety and security of our campus community is always our top priority,” the statement read. “We regret any inconvenience or harm caused by this decision, but we must prioritize the safety of all involved.”

The decision was met with protests from some students, who held signs reading “I stand with Cop City” and “UNC silences dissent.”

“This decision is a clear attempt to silence those who hold dissenting views,” said one student protester. “It’s disappointing to see the university bow to pressure from those who don’t want to hear what we have to say.”

The university’s decision to cancel the event has also drawn criticism from civil liberties groups, who say that it is a violation of free speech.

“Free speech is a core value of our democracy, and universities have a responsibility to defend it,” said Katie Fallow, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “The decision to cancel this event is a step backward for UNC and raises serious questions about the university’s commitment to free expression.”

The “Cop City” movement, which advocates for the defunding and abolition of police departments, has gained traction in recent years, with activists across the country taking to the streets to demand systemic changes in law enforcement.

But the movement has also faced pushback from those who believe that police departments are essential for public safety.

In a statement, the UNC College Republicans said that they “stand with law enforcement” and that the “Cop City” movement is “antithetical to our values.”

“We believe that the police play a critical role in maintaining public safety, and we reject the idea that they should be abolished,” the statement read.

But students at UNC say that the university’s decision to cancel the event sends a message that dissenting voices will not be heard.

“This decision is about more than just one event,” said another student protester. “It’s about the broader culture of censorship and suppression that we’re seeing on campuses across the country.”

The controversy at UNC comes amid a broader debate over free speech on college campuses, with some arguing that universities are increasingly restricting the rights of students and faculty members to speak freely.

In recent years, several high-profile incidents have sparked controversy, including a 2017 incident at Middlebury College, where protesters disrupted a speech by controversial conservative author Charles Murray, and a 2018 incident at Evergreen State College, where faculty members were targeted by student activists.

But some free speech advocates say that universities have a responsibility to protect students from hate speech and other forms of harassment.

“Free speech does not mean the right to harass or intimidate others,” said David Hudson, a law professor at Belmont University and First Amendment expert. “Universities have a responsibility to ensure that all members of their community feel safe and welcome, and that may sometimes mean placing reasonable restrictions on certain forms of speech.”

Despite the controversy, students at UNC say that they will continue to advocate for free speech and the right to dissent.

“We’re not going to be silenced,” said one student protester. “We’ll keep fighting for what we believe in, no matter what.”",1
116,Josh Smith gets shot at short with Rangers' Seager sidelined,"Injuries are an inevitable part of sports, and for the Texas Rangers, they may have just started to feel the effects. With starting shortstop Corey Seager sidelined due to a fractured right hand, the Rangers have turned to Josh Smith to fill his shoes.

Smith, a 24-year-old prospect acquired from the New York Yankees organization last year, has been playing in the minor leagues for the Rangers. He made his major league debut on Monday against the Detroit Tigers, starting at shortstop and batting ninth in the lineup.

While Smith is relatively new to the Rangers organization, he has already shown promise in the minor leagues. In 67 games at Double-A Frisco last season, Smith hit .305 with an .857 OPS. He also stole 12 bases and played solid defense at shortstop, committing just six errors.

But taking the field in the majors is a whole different ballgame, and Smith was well aware of the challenge he faced.

""I'm excited to be here, and I'm just going to try to play my game,"" Smith said before the game. ""I think if I stick to my approach, everything will take care of itself.""

Smith's first game in the majors started out rocky, as he committed an error in the first inning that led to a run for the Tigers. But he bounced back, making a diving play to rob Victor Reyes of a hit in the fourth inning.

Offensively, Smith went 0-for-3 with a walk and a strikeout, but he showed good plate discipline and worked counts well against Tigers starter Tarik Skubal.

Overall, it was a decent first outing for Smith, and he'll have a chance to continue to prove himself in the coming days as Seager is expected to be out for at least a month.

While some may be concerned about the loss of Seager, Rangers manager Chris Woodward is confident in Smith's abilities.

""He's a gamer,"" Woodward said after the game. ""He doesn't look intimidated by the moment. He made a great play, and he looked good at the plate. I think he's going to do just fine for us.""

Of course, Smith is not the only option the Rangers have at shortstop with Seager out. They also have Anderson Tejeda, who played shortstop in the minor leagues and made his major league debut last season, appearing in 23 games and hitting .253 with two home runs.

Tejeda was not in the starting lineup on Monday, but Woodward has expressed confidence in his abilities as well.

""He's got a lot of talent,"" Woodward said. ""He can play anywhere in the infield, and he's got some pop in his bat too. He just needs to get comfortable and trust himself.""

As for Seager, he was off to a solid start in his first year with the Rangers, hitting .246 with one home run and six RBIs in 12 games. He suffered the injury when he was hit by a pitch from Seattle Mariners pitcher Marco Gonzales on Saturday.

The loss of Seager is a significant blow to the Rangers, who have struggled offensively so far this season. They are last in the American League in runs scored and have a team OPS of just .642.

But with Smith and Tejeda waiting in the wings, the Rangers have some options to try to fill the void left by Seager's absence.

For Smith, this is his chance to show what he can do at the highest level of the game. He may be a relative unknown to some, but he's ready to prove that he belongs.

""I'm just going to go out there every day and try to play my game,"" Smith said. ""I'm excited for the opportunity, and I'm going to give it everything I've got.""",1
117,Small towns reclaim abandoned ski areas as nonprofits,"In rural parts of the United States, small communities are taking on a unique challenge. While many once-thriving ski resorts have been abandoned by private owners due to financial struggles, town leaders are taking the reins and transforming these abandoned areas into nonprofit organizations that bring winter recreation and visitors back into their communities.

For years, small ski towns have struggled with the decline of the ski industry. As climate change has become more apparent, warmer temperatures have caused snowfall to decrease and ski resorts to operate for shorter seasons. These challenges led some private ski area owners to shutter their operations, leaving behind empty trails and buildings.

But in recent years, towns like Berlin, New Hampshire, and Tehachapi, California, have taken a different approach. Rather than letting these shuttered ski resorts fall apart, local leaders have banded together to create nonprofit organizations that focus on revitalizing the areas and welcoming visitors once again.

One such example is the North Country Ski Club in Berlin, New Hampshire, which is led by local volunteers who have transformed the former ski area into a thriving community center. The North Country Ski Club offers a variety of activities, including cross-country and downhill skiing, snowshoeing, and hiking. The club also hosts events for local school groups and offers youth ski programs to encourage young people to get outside and enjoy the winter landscape.

“It’s really become a hub of the community in the winter,” said Milan Lutz, a volunteer with the North Country Ski Club. “We’ve been able to bring people together and offer an affordable option for outdoor recreation.”

Another example is the Tehachapi Winter Sports Foundation in Tehachapi, California. This organization has transformed the former Mountain High Ski Resort into an epicenter of winter activities. The Foundation offers skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and other winter sports and activities. As a nonprofit, the Tehachapi Winter Sports Foundation focuses on providing affordable winter activities to the community and schools, while also hosting events and competitions that draw visitors from around the region.

“With our nonprofit status, we’ve been able to offer discounts to local schools and really make the winter sports accessible to everyone,” said Donnie Mroz, a member of the Tehachapi Winter Sports Foundation.

These small towns have found success in revitalizing abandoned ski areas by taking a community-first approach. By creating nonprofit organizations that offer affordable winter recreation opportunities and community programs, these small towns have been able to turn their once-struggling ski areas into thriving community centers.

However, there are still challenges that these communities face. As climate change continues to affect winter weather patterns, these nonprofit organizations must remain adaptable and creative in their approach to winter recreation. Additionally, some communities face financing difficulties as they work to fix and maintain neglected ski area infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, towns across the country are embracing the potential of their abandoned ski areas and the opportunities they offer to their communities. And as these nonprofits continue to grow and expand, they serve as a shining example of rural communities banding together to make the most of their resources and create vibrant, sustainable futures for themselves.",1
118,EPA awards $177 million to environmental justice groups,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced that it will award $177 million to environmental justice groups that work to address environmental issues in low-income and minority communities across the country.

The grant, which is the largest ever awarded by the EPA for environmental justice, aims to provide funding to community-based organizations that are focused on addressing environmental and public health issues in underserved communities.

According to the EPA, the funding will help support projects that address a range of issues, including air quality, lead poisoning, and environmental contamination. The agency says that the grants will also support efforts to build community resilience in the face of climate change and other environmental challenges.

“Environmental justice is at the heart of EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment, and we are committed to advancing environmental justice for all communities,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan in a statement. “With this historic investment, we can help lift up communities that have been historically underserved, overburdened, and marginalized.”

The grants are part of the EPA’s Environmental Justice Small Grants Program, which was established in 1994 to provide funding to community-based organizations working on environmental justice issues. The program has provided grants to over 1,500 organizations, many of which are located in low-income and minority communities.

Environmental justice advocates have long argued that low-income and minority communities are disproportionately impacted by environmental issues, due to factors such as proximity to polluting industries and inadequate environmental regulations.

In recent years, the issue has gained more attention, with climate change exacerbating existing environmental inequalities and leading to more extreme weather events that hit vulnerable communities the hardest.

The EPA’s announcement of the $177 million grant comes as the agency works to strengthen its commitment to environmental justice under the Biden administration. Earlier this year, President Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to prioritize environmental justice in their policies and programs.

Environmental justice advocates have welcomed the EPA’s announcement, calling it a significant step towards addressing environmental inequalities in low-income and minority communities.

“Environmental justice communities have been suffering for decades from the cumulative impacts of pollution and environmental degradation,” said Mustafa Santiago Ali, vice president of environmental justice, climate, and community revitalization at the National Wildlife Federation. “This critical investment will help to begin to address those environmental injustices and bring much needed relief to the people who need it most.”

With the $177 million grant, the EPA is sending a clear message that environmental justice is a top priority for the agency moving forward. The funding will help support community-based organizations that are working to address environmental issues in some of the nation’s most vulnerable communities, and represents an important step towards creating a more just and equitable society.",1
119,Unemployment fell to 3.5% under Biden. For how much longer?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Unemployment in the United States fell to 3.5% in November 2021 under President Joe Biden, the lowest level since the pandemic began. However, many economists and policymakers have expressed concerns about whether this trend can continue in the months ahead.

Despite the steady decline in unemployment, there are still millions of individuals who remain out of work or underemployed. Among them are those who have been affected by the ongoing supply chain disruptions, as well as individuals who have struggled to find work due to the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the Biden administration has taken steps to address these challenges, such as through infrastructure investments and increasing support for small businesses, many experts fear that structural challenges in the labor market will hinder the nation's recovery in the long term.

""We are definitely in a better place than we were a year ago, but there are still many challenges that we need to address,"" said Lisa D. Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University. ""If we don't address these challenges, we risk slipping back into a period of prolonged stagnation.""

One of the key challenges facing the labor market is the persistence of labor shortages in certain sectors of the economy. This has been particularly acute in industries such as retail, hospitality, and manufacturing, where employers have struggled to attract and retain workers.

While some have pointed to the enhanced unemployment benefits that were put in place during the pandemic as a contributing factor to these shortages, many experts argue that the root causes are more complex.

""Part of what we're seeing is that many workers have simply left the labor force altogether,"" said Karen Dynan, a professor of the practice of economics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ""There are a lot of reasons for this, including ongoing health concerns, caregiving responsibilities, and career changes. Addressing these issues will require a comprehensive approach, including investing in education and training programs.""

Another challenge facing the labor market is the increasing polarization of employment opportunities. While some sectors have seen robust growth in recent years, many others have struggled to keep pace.

This is particularly true in rural and low-income communities, where job losses and wage stagnation have been persistent problems. While the Biden administration has proposed investments in infrastructure and workforce development as means of addressing these issues, many experts are skeptical that these initiatives will be enough on their own.

""We need to take a more holistic approach to addressing these issues,"" said Cook. ""This means investing in education, healthcare, and other critical infrastructure, as well as creating more equitable employment opportunities across different regions of the country.""

In addition to these challenges, many economists are also concerned about broader economic trends that could impact unemployment in the years ahead. One of the most significant of these is the continued shift toward automation and digitization in the workforce.

As more employers adopt technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics, many jobs are likely to be displaced or fundamentally transformed. While some see this as an opportunity for innovation and growth, others worry that it could lead to significant disruptions in the labor market.

""We're already seeing the effects of automation in many different sectors, including manufacturing, logistics, and even healthcare,"" said Dynan. ""The question is not whether it will continue, but how we can manage this transition in a way that minimizes the negative impacts on workers and communities.""

To address these challenges and prepare for the future of work, many experts are calling for a comprehensive rethinking of labor policies and practices.

This could include investments in education and training programs, as well as targeted measures to address the specific challenges facing different sectors of the economy.

""We need to understand that the challenges facing the labor market are not just a short-term problem,"" said Cook. ""There are deep-rooted structural issues that need to be addressed if we want to create a more resilient and equitable economy going forward.""

As the Biden administration continues to grapple with these challenges, many are looking to policymakers and business leaders to work together to create a more inclusive and sustainable economy.

""The next few years will be critical in shaping the future of work in the U.S.,"" said Dynan. ""We have an opportunity to create a more equitable and just society, but it will require bold action and a deep commitment to addressing the complex challenges that we face.""",1
120,Major Indiana plastics fire nearly out but residents worry,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) – A major fire at a plastics plant in rural Indiana is nearly extinguished, but nearby residents remain concerned about the toxicity of the smoke and potential long-term health effects.

The blaze, which started at the PolyOne plant in Boggstown on Saturday morning, sent a plume of thick, black smoke into the sky that could be seen for miles. Local fire departments responded promptly and worked around the clock to contain the inferno, which was declared under control on Monday morning. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

PolyOne produces a range of plastic products that are used in automobiles, medical devices, and packaging materials. The company's plant in Boggstown employs about 270 people and has been in operation since 1969. No injuries have been reported as a result of the fire, but local residents fear that they may be experiencing the fallout.

Judy Brown, who has lived in Boggstown for over 20 years, said that the smoke was overwhelming. ""It smelled like chemicals and it was really thick,"" she said. ""I'm worried about the long-term effects on our health. We have a lot of kids and elderly people here who are vulnerable."" Brown said that she has been experiencing breathing difficulties since the fire started.

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) has been monitoring the air quality around the PolyOne plant and has assured residents that the levels of toxins in the air are within safe limits. ""We have been conducting continuous air monitoring at the site and in the surrounding area,"" said IDEM spokesperson Barry Sneed. ""Any hazardous levels of pollutants would have been detected immediately and evacuation orders would have been issued.""

However, some residents remain skeptical. ""I don't trust the government to tell us the truth,"" said Mike Thompson, who lives a few miles from the plant. ""We need to have independent testing done to make sure that the air isn't poisoned. The health and safety of our community is at stake."" Thompson said that he is planning to organize a community meeting to discuss the issue.

Dr. Sarah Anderson, a toxicologist at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, said that exposure to the chemicals in the smoke could lead to respiratory and skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. ""The toxic effects depend on the type of plastic that was burning and the duration and intensity of exposure,"" she said. ""Long-term exposure to certain chemicals can increase the risk of cancer and other health problems.""

PolyOne has promised to cooperate with IDEM's investigation and to keep the public informed about any potential health risks. ""We take the safety of our employees, customers, and communities very seriously,"" said PolyOne spokesperson Kim Lindsey. ""We will work closely with local authorities and state regulators to clean up the site and ensure that the impacts of the fire are minimized.""

The fire has also raised questions about the safety of plastics manufacturing in Indiana and the regulation of hazardous materials. Indiana is home to dozens of plastics plants that produce a wide range of products, from toys to syringes to automotive parts. While the industry provides jobs and revenue for the state, it also poses risks to public health and the environment.

According to a report by the Indiana Public Interest Research Group (INPIRG), there have been 107 hazardous waste spills in Indiana since 2016, including several at plastics plants. The report criticized the state's regulatory system for being too lax and called for stricter enforcement of environmental laws.

State officials say that they are committed to protecting public health and are reviewing their policies and procedures in light of the PolyOne fire. ""We take these incidents very seriously and will do everything we can to prevent them from happening in the future,"" said Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb.

But for residents like Judy Brown, the damage may already be done. ""We need to know what we're breathing in and what the long-term effects are going to be,"" she said. ""We can't just sweep this under the rug and pretend that everything is okay.""",1
121,"Terry's Texas roster in flux, a new challenge for new coach","When the University of Texas at Austin fired its football coach Tom Herman in January, many fans and pundits expected relatively smooth sailing for his replacement, Steve Sarkisian. After all, Sarkisian had served as an offensive coordinator for the Alabama Crimson Tide, one of the strongest teams in college football, and his track record included top-notch quarterback development.

But things have not gone according to plan for Sarkisian, who is now tasked with assembling a strong roster for his inaugural season as head coach. Terry's Texas roster, in particular, remains in flux just two months before the start of the season, creating a new challenge for Sarkisian and his staff.

The departure of several key players, including linebacker Joseph Ossai and offensive tackle Samuel Cosmi, has left the team with significant gaps in both talent and experience. The Longhorns' secondary also requires significant attention after allowing 29 touchdown passes and finishing last in the Big 12 in pass defense last year.

Compounding matters, three former Texas players entered the transfer portal in the past few weeks, with two opting for other programs and one, linebacker Juwan Mitchell, ultimately deciding to stay at Texas. The loss of defensive lineman Marqez Bimage to the University of Houston and quarterback Ja'Quinden Jackson to the University of Utah is a blow for a roster that already lacked depth.

Sarkisian and his staff have been working tirelessly to fill these holes by recruiting high school standouts and pursuing experienced transfer players. So far, the coaching staff has landed a handful of high-profile transfer players, including veteran running back Keilan Robinson from Alabama.

But some of the team's potential issues may not be fully resolved until the season begins, especially if ongoing quarterback competitions for Sam Ehlinger's replacement remain undecided. Hudson Card and Casey Thompson have both shown promise in practice, but neither has played a significant role in games yet.

Despite these challenges, Sarkisian believes that the team can still achieve success in the upcoming season. In a recent press conference, the coach emphasized the need for his team to have a strong work ethic and a positive attitude.

""We're going to have to be really good at taking small steps every single day to improve,"" Sarkisian said. ""We're going to have to have an incredible mentality and work ethic with the way we approach our craft every single day.""

With just a few weeks left until the season opener against the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Longhorns fans and college football enthusiasts alike will be keeping a close eye on the team's progress as Sarkisian and his staff work to build a competitive roster. Only time will tell how successful the new coach's efforts will be, but one thing is for certain: the Twin Towers at UT, Cedric Benson and Vince Young, would have their eyes set on the new head coach expecting nothing lesser than the best.",1
122,Magic Johnson delivers another assist in Commanders purchase,"Magic Johnson, the five-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer, has played another crucial role in the world of sports, proving that his business acumen is just as impressive as his skills on the court. Johnson, through his investment firm, Magic Johnson Enterprises (MJE), has teamed up with Platinum Equity founder Tom Gores, to purchase the San Antonio Commanders, a former American Alliance of Football (AAF) team.

Initially, Tom Dundon, billionaire owner of the Carolina Hurricanes, bought the league for $250 million but ultimately shut it down eight weeks into its first season, leaving the Commanders and other AAF teams without a league or a future. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the league and the Commanders' future, Magic Johnson and Tom Gores' investment in the team provides a glimmer of hope.

Johnson, who already owns stakes in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Lakers, has demonstrated his commitment to sports franchises, stating that sports teams are a ""great investment"" because people will always love and support sports. He has also stated that his investment philosophy is centered around investing in projects he is passionate about, such as sports.

""Passion is the key to my investing philosophy. I always invest in businesses I'm passionate about. I love sports, and I'm passionate about creating winning teams on and off the court,"" Johnson stated in a recent interview.

Similarly, Gores, who has an estimated net worth of $5.7 billion, is also no stranger to the sports industry. He is the owner of the Detroit Pistons and has also invested in other sports franchises, including the Premier League's Everton Football Club.

With the purchase of the Commanders, Johnson and Gores have brought hope to the team's fans and the city of San Antonio. In a statement, Johnson expressed his excitement about the purchase and his commitment to making the Commanders a success.

""I am thrilled to partner with Tom Gores to bring the San Antonio Commanders back to life. We are committed to making the team a success on and off the field, giving our fans a thrilling experience and putting the team on a path to long-term success,"" Johnson said.

Although the future of the Commanders is still uncertain, the purchase shows that the team has the backing of two successful businessmen who are determined to make it a success. Furthermore, it is clear that Magic Johnson's business skills and passion for sports are yet again delivering assists for sports fans everywhere.",1
123,Women's tennis tour ends Peng Shuai-inspired China boycott,"Women's professional tennis is set to return to China after a prolonged boycott that lasted nearly two years, thanks to the intervention of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai.

The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) made the announcement on March 31, confirming that the tour would resume in China later this year. The decision followed a long hiatus after Peng Shuai disappeared from public view shortly after accusing a top-ranking Chinese official of sexual assault.

In 2018, Peng Shuai, who was then ranked 20th in the world, accused former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. Following her accusations, she disappeared for several weeks, sparking concern among fans and human rights advocates. She later reappeared, but the tennis world boycotted China in support of Peng.

The controversy only added fuel to the long-standing accusations of sexism, racism and censorship within China, that have long plagued its sports industry. China's government has repeatedly denied any allegations of wrongdoing and insisted its policies are in line with international norms.

The announcement that the WTA would be returning to China came as a surprise to many, given the Chinese government's resistance to any forms of criticism. For many, the WTA's decision signified a thaw in relations between the international body and the Chinese authorities.

""The WTA is pleased to announce that it has made significant progress in its effort to resume tournaments in China,"" said Steve Simon, WTA Chairman and CEO, in a statement. ""We look forward to working with our partners in China to bring back world-class women's tennis to fans in the country.""

The return of the women's tennis tour is set to take place in November 2021, with four events scheduled to take place across the country. It will mark the first time that women's tennis has been played in China since the WTA suspended its tournaments in 2019.

The decision was welcomed by many players, who had long been longing to return to China. ""I'm so excited to play in China again,"" said world number 3, Naomi Osaka. ""Chinese fans are so passionate about tennis and I'm looking forward to seeing them again.""

However, many human rights advocates and journalists criticized the move, calling for more accountability and transparency from the Chinese government. They argue that Peng Shuai's case is just one example of numerous human rights abuses in China, including the repression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet, the suppression of religious freedom, and the arrests of journalists and activists.

""The WTA's announcement is a naive, short-sighted and dangerous move that sends the wrong message to human rights abusers everywhere,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement. ""It does nothing to address the rampant abuse of human rights in China.""

However, some experts see the move as a strategic one, which could help to expose the problems in China's governance structure.

""By resuming tournaments in China, the WTA is sending a message that it is committed to working with Chinese officials to increase transparency and accountability, without sacrificing the well-being of its players,"" says Bonnie Glaser, Director of the China Power Project at the Center for American Progress.

""It's true that there are many issues that need to be addressed in China, but by bringing the players back to China, we can raise awareness of these issues and potentially find ways to address them,"" she added.

In a video message released by the WTA, Peng Shuai expressed her support for the resumption of tournaments in her home country. ""I'm so happy to see that the WTA is coming back to China, and I believe that this will help to promote tennis and sportsmanship in China,"" she said.

Despite the controversy and boycott, Peng Shuai has continued to play tennis, although her rankings have slipped significantly since 2018. She currently ranks 351 in the world, but many still see her as a symbol of resistance and justice.

""I think Peng Shuai has shown incredible courage and resilience in the face of these attacks,"" says Glaser. ""Her case has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in China, and I think this will continue to spur international action in the years to come."" 

Overall, the return of women's tennis to China marks a significant moment in the battle for human rights and transparency in China. While it is unlikely to resolve all of the outstanding issues, it could provide a platform for players and advocates to raise awareness, demand accountability, and stand in solidarity with those affected by injustice.",1
124,"As shootings hit close to home, govs wrestle with next steps","As shootings hit close to home, govs wrestle with next steps

In a span of just two weeks, three deadly mass shootings shook the United States, leaving dozens of people dead and several others injured. The incidents have once again reignited the debate over gun control laws in the country.

While lawmakers in Washington D.C. are still divided over what measures to take, governors across the country are grappling with the next steps they need to take to keep their constituents safe.

Governors from both parties are calling for action on gun laws, but they are also looking at other solutions that could help prevent mass shootings.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, recently signed a new law that makes it easier for law enforcement officials to temporarily take guns away from people who may pose a danger to themselves or others. The bill, which takes effect in 2020, also requires background checks for people buying ammunition.

“California has always been a leader in common-sense gun laws, and now we are taking yet another step forward,” Newsom said in a statement. “These new laws will help ensure that guns don’t fall into the wrong hands, and that people who are a danger to themselves or others aren’t able to harm themselves or anyone else.”

But not all governors are pushing for stricter gun control laws. For instance, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, has proposed a “red flag” law that would allow law enforcement officials to take guns away from people who may pose a danger to themselves or others, but he has also emphasized the need to address mental health issues as a way to prevent mass shootings.

“We can’t just focus on the guns. We have to address the underlying issues that are driving these shootings,” DeWine said in a recent press conference.

DeWine’s proposal includes mental health services, expanded background checks, and tougher penalties for people who sell guns to people who aren’t legally allowed to have them. He has also called for more resources to be devoted to mental health treatment and for schools to have more security measures in place.

While DeWine’s proposal has received some criticism from gun control advocates, it has also been praised as a balanced approach to tackling the issue of gun violence.

Other governors are taking a different approach. Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, has proposed a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as universal background checks for all gun sales.

“Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines are weapons of war,” Raimondo said in a statement. “They have no place on our streets, and they have no place in our communities.”

Raimondo’s proposal has faced opposition from gun rights groups, who argue that such measures infringe on their Second Amendment rights. However, Raimondo has been steadfast in her belief that such measures are necessary to prevent future tragedies.

Meanwhile, some governors are taking more holistic approaches to tackling gun violence. Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, has proposed expanding mental health services and increasing funding for school safety measures, as well as enacting “red flag” laws.

Polis has also called for a ban on bump stocks, which can turn a semi-automatic firearm into a fully automatic weapon, and for mandatory background checks for all gun sales.

“We need to take a comprehensive approach to preventing gun violence,” Polis said in a statement. “That includes addressing mental health issues, improving school safety, and enacting common-sense gun laws.”

While governors are pushing for action on gun violence, many of them are also frustrated with the lack of progress at the federal level. Democrats in Congress have called for stronger gun control measures, but Republicans, who control the Senate, have so far resisted their efforts.

In the wake of the recent shootings, President Donald Trump has called for stronger background checks, but he has also expressed support for “red flag” laws and for arming teachers in schools.

The issue of gun violence is likely to remain a topic of debate in the months to come as lawmakers at both the state and federal levels continue to grapple with how best to tackle the problem. In the meantime, governors are taking action to prevent future tragedies, but their efforts may not be enough to solve the problem on their own.

“We need action at the federal level,” said Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, in a recent statement. “But in the absence of that, we as governors must do everything in our power to protect our constituents from the scourge of gun violence.”",1
125,The anime hit 'Suzume' and Shinkai's cinema of cataclysm,"Anime has always been a wildly popular form of entertainment across the world, but every now and then a special series is released that manages to capture the hearts and minds of audiences everywhere. One such series is the recent hit ""Suzume,"" a story about a young girl with a passion for dance who finds herself drawn into a world of magic and danger.

While the series has received widespread critical acclaim for its storytelling and animation, it's also part of a larger movement within the anime industry towards a more cerebral, introspective type of storytelling. This type of anime is characterized by intense character development, exploration of deeper themes and emotions, and a willingness to tackle the most difficult and challenging aspects of life head on.

The creator of ""Suzume,"" Makoto Shinkai, is one of the leading directors in this new wave of anime. His films are often centered around themes of love, loss, and the passage of time, and his unique style has won him a legion of devoted fans both in Japan and around the world.

But what sets Shinkai apart from many of his peers is his willingness to explore subjects that are sometimes uncomfortable or unpleasant. His movies often deal with dark subject matter, such as natural disasters, war, and societal collapse. Yet even in the midst of these cataclysmic events, Shinkai manages to find moments of hope and connection that resonate with audiences.

""Suzume"" is no exception to this trend. The series takes place in a world that is very different from our own, but which nevertheless feels vivid and alive. Suzume, the titular character, is a young girl who dreams of becoming a dancer. When a mysterious boy named Haku appears and offers her the chance to learn to dance like a pro, Suzume jumps at the opportunity.

But this isn't just any dance training. Haku is actually a magical creature from another realm, and the dances he teaches Suzume include powerful spells and incantations that can change the world around them. As they travel across the country, performing for audiences and battling against other magical beings, Suzume grows stronger and more confident in her abilities.

Despite the magical trappings, ""Suzume"" is ultimately a story about the power of perseverance and the importance of following your dreams. Suzume's journey is full of setbacks and challenges, but she never gives up or loses sight of her goals. Along the way, she gains new friends and allies who help her on her quest, and discovers hidden strengths and talents within herself.

This is a hallmark of Shinkai's work as well. All of his movies feature characters who are struggling with difficult personal issues, whether it's the grief of losing a loved one or the isolation of being an outsider in a new city. But even as they confront these challenges, they find strength in their connections with one another, and ultimately come out stronger and wiser for the experience.

Of course, the cataclysmic events that feature so prominently in Shinkai's movies can't be ignored. Natural disasters are a recurring theme in his work, and they often serve as a metaphor for the larger issues that humanity faces in a rapidly changing world. In ""Your Name,"" one of Shinkai's most beloved films, a comet strike threatens to destroy a small town and the people who live there. But even as the disaster looms, the characters find moments of beauty and connection that make their struggles worth enduring.

Similarly, ""Suzume"" has its share of apocalyptic imagery. In the opening scenes, we see a vast wasteland stretching out for miles in every direction, with only a handful of people struggling to survive in the harsh environment. The creatures that Suzume and Haku battle are often terrifying and otherworldly, with powers that seem to defy human understanding.

But even amidst all this chaos and devastation, there is a sense of hope and resilience that pervades the story. Suzume refuses to give up on her quest, even when it seems impossible, and her determination inspires those around her to keep going as well. And even in the darkest moments, there are glimmers of light and beauty that remind us of the power of life and all that it encompasses.

In the end, ""Suzume"" is a testament to the strength of the human spirit, and to the power of art and creativity to help us navigate the most trying of circumstances. Makoto Shinkai's cinema of cataclysm may be challenging at times, but it's also deeply moving and ultimately hopeful. As we continue to grapple with our own cataclysmic issues as a civilization, it's important to remember that we are not alone in our struggles, and that there is always hope to be found, even in the darkest times.",1
126,Cambodia to deport 19 Japanese cybercrime scam suspects,"Cambodia will deport 19 Japanese nationals who were arrested on suspicion of running a massive cybercrime scam, according to the police.

In a statement, the police said that they had detained the suspects for alleged involvement in a scam operation that conned thousands of people in Japan out of their money.

The scam operation involved a scheme that pretended to offer high-return investments using various financial instruments, such as stocks and forex trading. The scheme was run through websites and social media platforms, targeting vulnerable and unsuspecting investors.

The suspects were arrested in a series of raids across the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, and Siem Reap province. The operation was conducted by anti-cybercrime police in cooperation with Japanese authorities.

According to the authorities, the suspects had been using Cambodia as a base to run the scam operation for several years. They had set up companies and rented apartments to carry out their illegal activities.

The suspects, aged between 22 and 54, have reportedly confessed to their involvement in the scam. They are facing charges of fraud and violation of Japan's financial and securities laws.

Cambodian police will hand over the suspects to Japanese authorities, who will take them back to Japan for prosecution.

The scam has been described as one of the biggest cybercrime operations to hit Japan in recent years. Thousands of Japanese people fell victim to the scheme, losing billions of yen in the process.

The Cambodian government has hailed the arrests as a major breakthrough in its efforts to crack down on cybercrime and transnational organized crime.

Cambodia has become a destination for foreign criminals who use the country's lax law enforcement and visa regulations to carry out illegal activities. The government has recently stepped up efforts to curb transnational crime and improve its image as a safe and secure destination for tourists and investors.

In conclusion, the arrests and impending deportations of the 19 Japanese nationals mark a significant milestone in the fight against cybercrime and underline the importance of international cooperation in combating transnational organized crime.",1
127,"To fight cancer, EPA wants sterilizer companies to emit less","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing new regulations in an attempt to reduce emissions from sterilizer companies, in order to fight against the damaging effects of cancer-causing chemicals on both environmental and human health.

Sterilizers play an important role in the healthcare industry by ensuring that medical instruments are free of germs, bacteria and viruses. However, the manufacturing process also produces emissions from the use of ethylene oxide, a cancer-causing chemical which has been linked to increased cancer rates for those living in close proximity to sterilizer manufacturing plants.

Although the EPA has the power to regulate air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, it has been slow to apply this authority to sterilizer companies. However, with mounting pressure from health advocates and public health experts, the agency has begun to address this issue with a new proposal which seeks to reduce ethylene oxide emissions.

The proposed rule would require sterilizer companies to reduce their emissions by around 90% from current levels. This would be achieved by imposing limits on the amount of ethylene oxide emitted per machine, and by mandating the installation of new technologies that would capture the chemical before it is released into the environment.

There are currently around 100 sterilizer facilities across the United States. Over 3 million Americans live within a mile of one of these facilities, with many more at risk from ethylene oxide exposure due to the chemical's ability to travel through the air and contaminate nearby areas.

The health risks associated with ethylene oxide have been known for decades, but it has been largely overlooked by the regulatory system. As a result, its usage has surged in recent years. Ethylene oxide is also used in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, and other consumer products.

The EPA's proposal has been met with praise from public health advocates and environmental groups. However, the proposal has also been criticized by industry groups, who argue that the proposed limits would be too strict and could cause some sterilizer facilities to go out of business. Some companies have even threatened to sue the EPA if the proposed regulations are adopted.

Despite these criticisms, many experts argue that action on ethylene oxide is long overdue. The growing body of scientific evidence linking ethylene oxide to cancer has led many to call for more stringent regulations to protect public health. According to the EPA, exposure to ethylene oxide has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia.

The EPA's proposal follows a recent decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to lower the acceptable levels of ethylene oxide exposure. The new guidelines recommend a maximum exposure limit of 0.1 parts per million, significantly lower than the previous level of 1 part per million.

The CDC's new guidelines were prompted in part by a recent controversy in Illinois, where residents living near a sterilizer facility were found to have elevated levels of ethylene oxide in their blood. The facility in question, operated by Sterigenics, had been emitting ethylene oxide at levels that exceeded the legal limit for years, prompting widespread safety concerns and protests.

The Sterigenics controversy has shone a spotlight on the broader issue of ethylene oxide emissions and the need for increased regulations. In addition to the EPA's proposed rule, several states have also taken action to crack down on ethylene oxide, including Illinois, Georgia, and Michigan.

Illinois passed a new law in June which seeks to require companies emitting ethylene oxide to reduce their emissions to ""the maximum extent practicable."" The law also requires companies to notify the public of their emissions levels and conduct regular testing.

However, some experts argue that these state-level actions are not enough, and that stronger federal regulations are needed to protect the public from the dangers of ethylene oxide. The EPA's proposed rule is seen by many as a step in the right direction, but there is still a long way to go to address the serious health risks posed by this chemical.

The proposed rule will be subject to a public comment period before final regulations are adopted. The EPA is encouraging stakeholders to provide feedback on the proposed limits, and has also requested additional data on the cost and feasibility of implementing new technologies to reduce ethylene oxide emissions.

Overall, the EPA's proposed regulations represent a significant step forward in the fight against ethylene oxide and the cancer risks it poses. By reducing emissions from sterilizer companies and other sources, we can reduce the risks to both environmental and human health, and take a significant step forward in the battle against cancer.",1
128,Delta loses $363 million but says travel demand still strong,"Atlanta-based airline Delta reported on Tuesday a loss of $363 million for the third quarter of the year, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the aviation industry. Despite the loss, however, Delta CEO Ed Bastian remains optimistic about the future of air travel and the airline's capacity to weather the storm.

""Our September quarter results demonstrate the magnitude of the pandemic on our business while showing the depth and resilience of our people, and franchise,"" Bastian said in a statement. ""In a choppy demand environment, our team has been nimble, focused and creative in finding ways to keep people moving safely and confidently.""

Delta's $363 million loss in the third quarter is a considerable improvement over the $5.4 billion loss reported in the second quarter, when the pandemic was at its height in the United States. The airline's total revenue for Q3 was $3.1 billion, a 79 percent decrease from the same period in 2019. Delta said it has cut more than $6 billion in costs since the pandemic began, but it still expects to burn roughly $10 million per day in cash through the end of the year.

Despite the losses, Bastian emphasized that the demand for air travel continues to be strong. Delta's capacity for Q4 is expected to be down 35 to 40 percent year over year, but Bastian said he sees ""signs of improvement"" in bookings for November and December. He also noted that the airline has seen success in opening new routes to leisure destinations, such as Cancun and Cabo San Lucas, and expanding its cargo business to help offset some of the losses from passenger travel.

""We're optimistic that we're going to continue to see more bookings as the holiday season approaches,"" Bastian said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Tuesday. ""We're seeing a lot of frequency customers coming back and traveling. Business travel is still slow, but we expect it to come back gradually.""

Delta's report came as other airlines also reported significant losses for the third quarter. American Airlines, for example, reported a net loss of $2.4 billion, while United Airlines reported a net loss of $1.8 billion. Southwest Airlines, which has largely focused on domestic travel and has seen stronger demand than its competitors, reported a net loss of $1.2 billion.

The losses underscore the challenges facing the aviation industry as it tries to recover from the pandemic, which has resulted in a steep decline in passenger traffic and revenue. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said it expects global airlines to lose $84 billion this year, with a return to profitability not likely until 2022.

In an effort to boost consumer confidence in air travel, airlines and airports have implemented a range of safety measures, such as mandatory mask-wearing, enhanced cleaning protocols, and social distancing measures. Delta, for example, has implemented a ""Delta Clean"" initiative that includes electrostatic spraying of aircraft cabins, antimicrobial surface coating, and the use of HEPA filters to improve air quality.

Delta has also introduced a flexible booking policy that allows customers to change or cancel their flights without fees through the end of the year. Bastian said the policy has been well-received by customers and has helped boost bookings.

""As we continue to navigate the pandemic, we are constantly evolving our processes and procedures to ensure the safety of our employees and customers,"" Bastian said in the statement.

Despite the challenges facing the industry, Bastian said he remains optimistic about the future of air travel and Delta's ability to adapt to the ""new normal.""

""We've been able to adapt better than anyone expected,"" he said on CNBC. ""I think we're going to come out of this stronger than ever.""",1

Last year, the Italian DPA (Data Protection Authority) ordered the suspension of the AI model, citing concerns over user data privacy. The authority argued that ChatGPT had a flawed consent mechanism and violated certain GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) rules.

ChatGPT had been integrated into several Italian public institutions' websites, including the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, where it was being used to provide automated customer support and answer general questions.

Following the suspension, OpenAI implemented several changes to the model’s privacy and consent mechanisms to address the DPA's concerns. However, it has not yet been confirmed whether the changes were sufficient for the Italian authorities to lift the suspension.

OpenAI's ChatGPT is one of the largest and most complex natural language processing models globally, generating responses to user inputs based on large datasets of human-written text.

ChatGPT's suspension highlighted the challenge tech companies face regarding compliance with data protection laws as they seek to expand the capabilities of their AI systems. While features such as advanced natural language processing offer enormous potential to streamline and improve customer support systems, privacy and data security concepts are critical aspects that need equal consideration.

The AI-powered customer support systems have proven to be efficient and can save organizations time and money compared to hiring human customer support staff who require salary and paid benefits.

However, ensuring user privacy and data security should not be sidelined for the sake of streamlined efficiency. Data privacy is a fundamental right, and companies need to ensure that they comply with regulations relating to AI-processed user data.

OpenAI has declined to comment on the subject, but the Italian DPA has confirmed that it is in talks with the company regarding the changes made to the ChatGPT technology.

As AI technology continues to advance, discussions around data privacy, transparency, and consent mechanisms will become even more critical. Ensuring AI systems comply with data protection laws is critical for organizations to balance the need for improved efficiency and customer support with user privacy and data security. 
If OpenAI meets Italy's privacy requirements, ChatGPT could resume its operations soon.",1
131,Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes loses bid to stay out of prison,"Theranos' founder, Elizabeth Holmes, has lost her bid to stay out of prison, as a federal judge yesterday ruled that she must face trial over charges related to her former company's blood-testing technology.

Holmes, who was once hailed as a Silicon Valley visionary, was indicted in June 2018 on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in connection with her role in deceiving investors and patients about the effectiveness of Theranos' blood-testing devices.

The devices, which were supposed to revolutionize the field of blood testing, were found to be inaccurate and potentially dangerous. Despite this, Theranos raised more than $700 million from investors before the company's downfall in 2018.

Holmes and former Theranos president Sunny Balwani were charged with multiple counts of fraud, and both pleaded not guilty. In an attempt to avoid a criminal trial, Holmes had argued that she had been subjected to ""outrageous government misconduct"" and that the charges against her were improperly filed.

However, U.S. District Judge Edward Davila rejected Holmes' arguments, stating that ""the court finds that the government has presented a prima facie case of each element of wire fraud over which it has jurisdiction."" The judge also noted that there was no evidence of misconduct by the government.

Holmes' legal team has argued that she was simply a young entrepreneur trying to build a successful company, and that mistakes she made were not intentional. However, prosecutors contend that she and Balwani engaged in a scheme to defraud investors and patients by making false claims about Theranos' technology.

The next step in the case is a trial, which is currently scheduled to begin in March 2021. Holmes and Balwani face up to 20 years in prison if they are convicted.

The downfall of Theranos and the subsequent legal battle have garnered widespread attention, partly due to Holmes' celebrity status and the fact that she was once considered one of the most promising young entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.

The case has also raised questions about the role of regulators in overseeing new medical technologies, as well as the ethical responsibilities of entrepreneurs and investors in the tech industry.

In a statement released yesterday, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California said that ""we look forward to seeing justice served in this case.""

The statement continued, ""Innovation and entrepreneurship are vital to our economy, but so is integrity and honesty. At the end of the day, these criminal actions hurt real people and have a devastating impact on trust in the marketplace.""

Holmes' legal troubles are also far from over. In addition to the criminal charges, she and Theranos are facing several civil lawsuits from investors and former patients who claim they were harmed by the faulty blood-testing technology.

The lawsuits, which seek millions of dollars in damages, allege that Holmes and Theranos defrauded investors by making false claims about the company's technology and financial health, and that patients were put at risk by inaccurate blood tests.

It remains to be seen what the ultimate outcome of the criminal and civil cases against Holmes and Theranos will be. However, the legal battles have already had a significant impact on the tech industry, particularly in regards to how investors and regulators view the promises of new medical technologies.

As the Theranos case continues to unfold, it serves as a cautionary tale for entrepreneurs and investors alike about the importance of transparency, honesty, and ethical behavior in the tech industry.",1
132,"Nets' starless roster in NBA playoffs with no Durant, Irving","The Brooklyn Nets entered the NBA playoffs with a major hurdle to overcome: they would have to make a deep run without their two biggest stars. As the playoffs progressed, it became clear that this wasn't going to be an easy task.

The Nets' starless roster was a result of injuries to Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Durant, who missed most of the season due to a hamstring injury, was ruled out for the entire postseason due to a foot injury. Irving, on the other hand, suffered an ankle injury in the second round of the playoffs that forced him to miss the remainder of the series against the Milwaukee Bucks.

Despite these setbacks, the Nets managed to secure the second seed in the Eastern Conference with a 48-24 record. They breezed past the Boston Celtics in the first round, winning the series 4-1. However, they faced a tougher challenge in the second round against the Milwaukee Bucks.

The Bucks, led by two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, were a formidable opponent. The Nets managed to take a 2-0 lead in the series, but the Bucks rallied back to tie the series at 2-2. In Game 5, the Nets suffered a devastating loss as Irving went down with the ankle injury that would end his playoff run.

Without Irving, the Nets were forced to rely heavily on Durant and role players like Joe Harris and Blake Griffin. Durant put up a valiant effort, scoring 49 points in Game 5 to keep the game close, but it wasn't enough as the Bucks won 114-108.

In Game 6, the Nets once again found themselves in a tough spot. Down 3-2 in the series and without Irving, they had to win on the road against a confident Bucks team. Durant once again put up a heroic performance, scoring 48 points and grabbing 9 rebounds, but the Nets fell just short as Antetokounmpo and the Bucks closed out the series with a 115-111 victory.

For the Nets, the loss was a bitter pill to swallow. They had high hopes entering the season with Durant and Irving leading the way, but injuries derailed their plans. However, they can take solace in the fact that they battled hard without their two biggest stars.

Durant in particular was a bright spot for the Nets. He proved that he can still be one of the most dominant players in the league, even after missing most of the season with a hamstring injury. His scoring performances in Games 5 and 6 were reminiscent of his MVP seasons with the Golden State Warriors.

The Nets also got solid contributions from their role players throughout the playoffs. Harris was a sharpshooter from beyond the arc, hitting over 50% of his 3-point attempts in the first round against the Celtics. Griffin, who was signed midseason after being bought out by the Detroit Pistons, provided some much-needed scoring and energy off the bench.

Looking ahead, the Nets will have to regroup and assess their roster for next season. The big question mark is Irving, whose injury status remains unclear. He has missed significant time with injuries throughout his career, and the Nets will need to figure out a way to keep him healthy if they want to make another run at the championship.

The Nets will also need to address their depth, particularly at the point guard position. Without Irving, they had to rely on inexperienced players like Mike James and Bruce Brown to handle the ball. This was a major weakness for the Nets, and they will need to find a reliable backup point guard if they want to compete at a high level.

Despite the disappointing end to their season, the Nets can take some positives from the playoffs. They showed that they have a strong core of players who can step up in the absence of their stars, and they have one of the best players in the league in Durant when he is healthy.

The Nets will undoubtedly be one of the favorites to win the championship next season, assuming they can keep their key players healthy. If they can find a way to add depth to their roster and shore up their weaknesses, they could be a force to be reckoned with in the Eastern Conference. For now, though, they will have to settle for a hard-fought playoff run without their two biggest stars.",1
133,4 in 10 say next vehicle may be electric,"A new survey conducted by Consumer Reports reveals that 4 in 10 Americans are considering an electric vehicle for their next purchase. The survey was conducted in partnership with the Union of Concerned Scientists, an organization that advocates for a clean energy future, and involved responses from over 2,000 U.S. residents.

The results indicate a growing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) among the general public, with 63% of those surveyed saying they are more interested in EVs now than they were five years ago. Furthermore, 36% of respondents believe that EVs are more reliable than gasoline-powered cars, and 37% believe that they are less expensive to maintain.

But despite these positive perceptions, there are still obstacles for wider adoption of EVs, particularly around infrastructure and pricing. According to Consumer Reports, 60% of respondents said that they would not consider purchasing an EV if there were no charging stations within a reasonable distance of their home, and 48% cited the high upfront costs of EVs as a barrier.

However, the survey found that consumers are willing to pay a premium for EVs if it means reducing their carbon footprint. 73% of respondents said that they would be willing to pay more for an EV if it emitted less carbon emissions than a gasoline-powered car.

In addition to environmental concerns, respondents also expressed interest in the overall driving experience of EVs. 58% of respondents said that they were interested in the quiet ride that EVs offer, while 51% said that they were interested in the acceleration.

Consumer Reports notes that there are numerous options for those interested in purchasing an EV, ranging from all-electric models like the Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf, to plug-in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt and Toyota Prius Prime.

In recent years, automakers have also announced plans to introduce more electric models, particularly in response to government mandates to reduce carbon emissions. For example, Ford recently announced that it will invest $11 billion in electric technologies by 2022, and plans to introduce 16 fully electric vehicles by 2022.

Other major automakers, including General Motors, Volkswagen, and Volvo, have also announced plans to introduce electric models in the coming years.

Despite these developments, however, the infrastructure for EVs remains a challenge. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, as of August 2018, there were just over 20,000 publicly accessible charging stations in the U.S. This number is expected to increase, however, as utilities and other companies invest in charging infrastructure.

The federal government has also announced plans to invest in EV infrastructure. In June 2018, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the INVEST Act, which includes provisions to invest in EV charging infrastructure.

Despite the challenges, the future looks bright for EVs. In addition to the interest reflected in the Consumer Reports survey, other studies have also found growing interest in EVs among consumers. According to a survey conducted by AAA in September 2018, 20% of Americans said that their next vehicle will be an EV, while 80% said that they would consider an EV for their next vehicle.

Furthermore, a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance found that EVs will make up 54% of new car sales by 2040. This trend is being driven by declining battery costs, government incentives, and increased consumer awareness of the benefits of EVs.

As consumer interest in EVs grows, it is likely that automakers will respond with more options and lower prices. In the meantime, consumers interested in EVs should be sure to do their research and consider factors like infrastructure, pricing, and driving experience before making a purchase.

Overall, the Consumer Reports survey highlights a trend towards electric vehicles as consumers become more aware of the benefits of clean energy and innovative driving experiences. As automakers move towards a more environmentally conscious future, consumers will have a wide range of EV options to choose from.",1
134,Fatal abduction survivors reveal grisly Mexico captivity,"Mexico has been wracked by a series of high-profile kidnappings, with victims often held for ransom or sold into slavery. But a new trend has emerged, as abductors increasingly imprison their victims for longer periods of time in what survivors describe as ""horrifying"" and ""degrading"" conditions.

Several recently rescued kidnapping victims have shared their harrowing stories with the media, offering a glimpse into the brutal reality of life as a hostage in modern-day Mexico. Many of them were subjected to torture, rape, and other forms of violence at the hands of their captors, who often demanded exorbitant sums of money for their release.

One such victim, a young woman who asked to remain anonymous, told authorities she was kidnapped from a bus stop in broad daylight while on her way to work. Her abductors held her captive in a small, windowless room for more than two months, during which time they repeatedly beat and raped her.

""They treated me like an animal,"" she told AP News. ""I was forced to sleep on the floor and eat whatever scraps they gave me. They didn't care about my life, they only cared about getting money from my family.""

Another survivor, a middle-aged man who was abducted while on vacation with his family, said he was held in a dark, dirty cellar for nearly a year. His captors tortured him daily, using electrical shocks and other methods to extract information from him and his family.

""They wanted to know everything about us, our finances, our personal lives,"" he said. ""They would electrocute me until I passed out, then wake me up and start again. It was pure hell.""

Despite the horrors they endured, both survivors said they were grateful to be alive and thankful to the authorities who rescued them. They also called for stronger government action against kidnapping and human trafficking, which has become a major industry in Mexico.

""We need to end this plague of violence once and for all,"" said the woman. ""No one should have to go through what I went through. We need justice and we need it fast.""

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to tackle the problem of kidnapping head-on, announcing a new anti-kidnapping task force and promising to crack down on corruption and organized crime. But critics say more needs to be done to protect the country's citizens from abduction and slavery, calling for better law enforcement training and stronger penalties for kidnappers.

""This is a national crisis that demands immediate attention,"" said Jorge Romero, head of a prominent anti-kidnapping NGO. ""We cannot afford to let this continue. We need to send a message that criminals will be punished and victims will be protected.""",1
135,Vaping company Juul settles West Virginia lawsuit for $7.9M,"In a major victory for the state of West Virginia, vaping company Juul has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought against it for $7.9 million. The lawsuit alleged that the company had targeted young people with its advertising and misled them about the dangers of vaping.

The settlement, announced on Thursday, brings an end to a legal battle that began in 2019 when West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a lawsuit against Juul. The suit accused the company of violating the state's Consumer Credit and Protection Act and creating a public nuisance with its marketing practices.

Under the terms of the settlement, Juul has agreed to make a payment of $7.9 million to the state over the next six years. The company will also be required to implement a variety of measures designed to prevent underage vaping and to provide accurate information about the health risks associated with the practice.

These measures include implementing strict age verification procedures on the company's website and in its retail stores, conducting regular compliance checks to ensure that retailers are not selling the products to minors, and hiring an independent third-party monitor to oversee the company's compliance with the settlement.

In a statement released after the settlement was announced, Attorney General Morrisey emphasized the importance of protecting young people from the dangers of vaping. ""Our office will continue to hold accountable those who put our children at risk and seek to deceive them for profit,"" he said.

The settlement with West Virginia is just the latest legal setback for Juul, which has been facing increasing scrutiny over its marketing practices and the health risks associated with its products. Last year, the company reached a $40 million settlement with the state of North Carolina, and it has also been hit with several class-action lawsuits brought by individuals who claim to have been harmed by vaping.

Despite the legal challenges, Juul remains one of the most popular vaping brands in the United States, with a market share of over 50%. The company has faced criticism for its marketing practices, which have been accused of glamorizing vaping and making it seem like a safe alternative to tobacco smoking.

With the settlement in West Virginia, Juul is taking a significant step towards addressing these concerns and showing that it is committed to operating responsibly in the highly regulated vaping industry.",1
136,Takeaways from AP report on overfishing's threat to conch,"The Caribbean conch, a popular shellfish widely consumed across the region, is under threat due to overfishing, according to a new report by the Associated Press.

The AP report highlights how the increase in demand for conch meat is driving a massive hunt for the species, leading to a rapid decline in population levels that could devastate the Caribbean's marine ecosystem.

The report also reveals that the conch fishing industry, which has become a major source of income for many countries in the region, is largely unregulated. This means that despite official quotas on fishing, there are no real mechanisms to enforce them or to prevent illegal fishing from taking place.

The overfishing of conch poses a huge threat not only to the species itself but also to the wider ecosystem of the Caribbean. Conch, for example, plays a crucial role in maintaining coral reefs. They graze on the algae that would otherwise kill off the coral, helping to keep the reefs healthy and thriving.

Without conch, the coral reefs could be at risk of collapse, which would have serious consequences for the entire ecosystem of the region, including marine life, fishing industries and tourism.

The AP report highlights several key takeaways from the research:

1. The demand for conch meat is driving overfishing.

The increasing demand for conch meat, both within the Caribbean and overseas, is driving a desperate hunt for the shellfish. This is leading to massive overfishing of conch, which is already a slow-growing and low-reproducing species.

This demand has driven up the price of conch meat to the point where it is now more expensive than lobster in some parts of the Caribbean. This has created a black market trade in conch, which is often unregulated and environmentally damaging.

2. The conch fishing industry is largely unregulated.

Despite official quotas on fishing, there are no real mechanisms to enforce them or to prevent illegal fishing from taking place. This means that many fishermen are catching more conch than is allowed, and in some cases, they are catching immature conch that have not yet had a chance to breed.

This lack of regulation is putting the entire conch population and ecosystem in jeopardy.

3. The decline of conch could have serious consequences for the Caribbean's coral reefs.

Conch play a vital role in maintaining the health of the Caribbean's coral reefs. They graze on the algae that would otherwise kill off the coral, helping to keep the reef healthy and thriving. Without enough conch to maintain the natural balance, the coral reefs could be at risk of collapse, which would have serious consequences for the entire ecosystem of the region.

4. Solutions to the problem are available.

The AP report highlights several solutions that could help to protect the conch population and ecosystem. These include stricter regulations on fishing, the development of sustainable farming practices for conch, and greater investment in education and awareness-raising campaigns to encourage more responsible consumption of the shellfish.

Additionally, the report notes that several organizations and groups are already working on these issues, including the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism, which is working to improve regulations on conch fishing, and the Nature Conservancy, which is developing sustainable farming practices for conch.

In conclusion, the AP report highlights the urgent need for action to protect the Caribbean's conch population and ecosystem. With overfishing threatening the species and the wider marine environment, it is vital that governments, organizations and individuals take responsibility for the future of conch and the region's ecosystem.

By implementing sustainable practices, promoting responsible consumption and developing stronger regulatory frameworks, we can ensure that the Caribbean's conch population and ecosystem thrive for generations to come.",1
137,Methane big part of 'alarming' rise in planet-warming gases,"Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, has contributed significantly to the alarming rise in planet-warming gases, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Global Carbon Project.

The study found that methane emissions increased by 10 percent in the decade leading up to 2017, and that the gas is now responsible for around 20 percent of global warming. This is an alarming trend, as methane is around 28 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide over a 100-year timescale.

Furthermore, the report shows that methane emissions from human activities, such as agriculture, fossil fuel use, and waste management, are the primary drivers of the increase. Agriculture, in particular, is responsible for almost two-thirds of methane emissions, with livestock and rice cultivation being the main culprits.

The report highlights the need for urgent action to reduce methane emissions, in addition to CO2 emissions, to avoid catastrophic climate change. Methane emissions can be reduced through measures such as improving waste management and reducing the number of cattle.

However, this will require governments to implement policies and enforce regulations, as well as for businesses and individuals to take steps to reduce their emissions. The report notes that since methane is a short-lived gas, reducing emissions could have a rapid impact on global warming.

The study's lead author, Professor Rob Jackson of Stanford University, said, ""We have to control methane if we want to slow warming. If we can do that, it's likely to be the biggest bang for the buck, at least in the near term.""

Methane emissions have received increasing attention in recent years, as scientists have realized the extent of the gas's impact on the climate. However, the report notes that many countries still do not have accurate data on their emissions, making it difficult to target reduction efforts effectively.

The report also highlights the importance of reducing emissions from the fossil fuel industry, as well as the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. While carbon dioxide emissions have a longer-term impact on the climate, methane emissions can have a more immediate impact.

Scientists warn that the world is currently on track to exceed the 1.5 degree Celsius warming limit set by the Paris Agreement, which could have disastrous consequences for the planet. The recent UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow highlighted the urgent need for action to reduce emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

The report notes that reducing methane emissions would also have other benefits, such as improving air quality in urban areas and reducing health risks associated with pollution, especially in developing countries where open fires and other sources of emissions are common.

The study concludes, ""Methane control strategies can deliver significant climate benefits in the near term and also improve local air quality and health.""

In conclusion, the report highlights the urgent need for action to reduce methane emissions, as part of a broader effort to tackle climate change. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable future. As methane emissions continue to rise, it is clear that urgent action is needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",1
138,Hungary to pull out of Russia-linked bank after US sanctions,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary said Tuesday that it will pull out of the International Investment Bank (IIB), a multilateral institution with close ties to Russia, after the United States imposed sanctions on its chairman for alleged corruption.

The decision by Hungary, which owns 17 percent of the bank, is a significant blow to the IIB, which has struggled to gain recognition in the West amid concerns about its links to Moscow.

In a statement, Hungary's foreign ministry said that the U.S. sanctions against Nikolay Kosov, the IIB's chairman, had ""significantly undermined the credibility and stability"" of the bank.

""Given the current situation, Hungary cannot remain a member of an institution that is under intense scrutiny by a major partner such as the U.S.,"" the statement said.

The IIB, which was set up in 1970 as an economic forum for socialist countries, rebranded itself in 2012 as a multilateral development bank with a focus on Central and Eastern Europe.

But the institution's ties to Moscow have raised concerns among its Western partners, who fear that it could be used by Russia to advance its geopolitical interests.

Last year, the United States imposed sanctions on Kosov, alleging that he had engaged in corruption and money laundering during his tenure as head of Russia's Vnesheconombank.

Kosov, who denies the allegations, was appointed chairman of the IIB in 2018. His appointment was seen as a sign of the bank's growing ties to Russia.

The IIB has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to continue its operations despite the sanctions.

However, the decision by Hungary to pull out of the bank is likely to have a significant impact on its operations, as the country was one of its largest shareholders.

In recent years, Hungary has sought to strengthen its ties with Moscow, even as its relations with the European Union and the United States have deteriorated.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and has sought to curry favor with Moscow by opposing EU sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea.

The decision to pull out of the IIB is likely to be seen as a sign of Hungary's growing isolation from the West.",1
139,Black chiefs to meet amid debate on benefit of cop diversity,"In the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent widespread protests against police brutality and systemic racism, debates have arisen about the presence of diversity within police departments. While some argue that a more diverse police force can lead to better community relations and a more nuanced understanding of different communities, others question whether simply adding more officers of color to police departments will solve the underlying issues.

These debates will be at the center of an upcoming meeting of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), which is set to take place later this month.

NOBLE, which is made up of black law enforcement executives from across the country, is a crucial organization in the debate around police reform. The organization has long advocated for diversity within police departments, arguing that representation in law enforcement is essential for creating trust between law enforcement and communities of color.

However, as NOBLE prepares for its annual conference this year, which will be held virtually due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are questions about whether simply adding more black chiefs and officers to the police force is enough to address the systemic issues of police violence and racism.

Critics argue that simply adding more black officers to the force does not address deep-rooted, systemic issues that target marginalized communities, nor does it resolve issues around the use of force, accountability, and transparency.

""There's a difference between diversity and equity,"" said Mary Hooks, co-director of the Atlanta-based advocacy group Southerners on New Ground, in a recent interview with AP News. ""Just putting people in those positions doesn't equate to having true oversight, accountability or transformative justice.""

This debate between diversity and equity is not new to NOBLE. The organization has been around since 1976, and its members have been at the forefront of discussions about police reform since its inception. Over the years, NOBLE has sometimes been criticized for being too close to law enforcement organizations and not critical enough of the actions of individual police departments.

However, NOBLE leaders argue that having a seat at the table is necessary for change to occur. Rickey E. McCoy, NOBLE's national president, said in a statement that the organization is committed to ""inclusive, respectful and constructive conversations that lead to solutions.""

""We know that black executives have a unique perspective when it comes to the challenges facing our communities and the law enforcement agencies that serve them,"" McCoy said.

NOBLE has already made strides in pushing for change within police departments. One of the organization's main initiatives is its ""Law and Order in the Community"" program, which seeks to build trust between law enforcement and communities of color through community engagement and education.

Still, there is a push among some NOBLE members to do more than just add diversity to police departments. Some members have argued that the organization should focus on supporting efforts to defund or abolish police departments altogether, a controversial idea that has gained traction in recent months.

""As an organization, we need to be looking at systemic reform,"" said Cedric Alexander, a former NOBLE president and current CNN law enforcement analyst. ""We need to be looking at the way policing is done in this country and make sure it is safe, productive and respectful for all involved.""

NOBLE's conference this year will feature a panel discussion titled ""Policing in Black and Brown Communities: The Need for Radical Transformation."" The panel will include speakers from a variety of backgrounds, including academics, activists and law enforcement professionals.

The presence of such a panel is a sign that NOBLE is willing to engage in discussions around radical change, even as it continues to push for diversity within police departments. The conference will also feature workshops on topics such as ""The Role of Black Law Enforcement in Mental Health and Substance Abuse Responses"" and ""Strategies for Building a Diverse and Inclusive Police Department.""

Regardless of where individual members of NOBLE fall on the debate around police reform, the organization remains an essential voice in the push for change within law enforcement. As the nation grapples with the continued killings of unarmed black people by police officers, the need for organizations like NOBLE has never been more pressing.

""As black law enforcement executives, we have a responsibility to not only uphold the law but also to ensure that the law is applied fairly and equitably,"" said Dwayne Crawford, executive director of NOBLE's executive leadership institute. ""We have a responsibility to use our positions of power to advocate for change and to lift up the voices of those who have been historically marginalized.""

Whether NOBLE's focus will remain on adding diversity within police departments or shifting toward systemic reform remains to be seen. However, there is no doubt that the organization's members will remain at the forefront of discussions around police reform, as they work to ensure that law enforcement truly serves all communities.",1
140,N. Korea says it tested new solid-fuel long-range missile,"North Korea announced on Friday that it had successfully tested a new long-range missile with solid fuel. The country's leader, Kim Jong Un, oversaw the launch and declared the weapon system operational, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

The test, which took place on Thursday, was North Korea's first missile launch in nearly three months. The country had previously conducted a series of short-range missile tests and unveiled new weapons at military parades in recent months, but had refrained from launching longer-range missiles since March.

The new missile, which the KCNA described as a ""long-range cruise missile,"" is powered by solid fuel, which allows for quicker and more flexible deployment than liquid-fueled missiles. The KCNA said that the missile flew for over two hours, covering a distance of 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) before hitting its target with ""great accuracy.""

Analysts say that the new missile appears to be a variant of the KN-23, a short-range ballistic missile that North Korea began testing in 2019, which is also powered by solid fuel. The KN-23 has a maximum range of 600 kilometers (370 miles) and can carry a conventional or nuclear warhead.

The new missile's longer range and improved accuracy could make it a more potent weapon than the KN-23, which is already considered a significant threat to South Korea and other countries in the region. The KCNA did not specify the new missile's range, but experts say it could be capable of traveling up to 3,000 kilometers (1,860 miles), putting Japan and U.S. military bases on Guam within striking distance.

""The successful development of a long-range cruise missile, which is low-altitude and maneuverable, is a major boost to North Korea's military capabilities and a serious threat to the security of the region,"" said Lee Su-seok, a professor at Korea National Defense University in Seoul.

The launch comes amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States. The two sides have not held talks since February 2019, when a summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Hanoi ended without an agreement on denuclearization or sanctions relief.

Since then, North Korea has continued to produce nuclear weapons and missiles, despite calls from the international community to halt its weapons program. The United States, meanwhile, has maintained its policy of ""maximum pressure"" through economic sanctions and military exercises with South Korea.

The new missile test is likely to complicate efforts to resume talks between the two sides, which have been stalled since President Joe Biden took office in January. However, some analysts say that North Korea's decision to test a missile instead of a nuclear device could be a sign of its willingness to engage in diplomacy.

""By testing a missile instead of a nuclear device, North Korea is sending a message that it is still interested in talks and may be willing to make concessions if the United States is willing to negotiate,"" said Cheon Seong-whun, a former South Korean government official and security expert.

Others, however, say that the missile test is a clear signal that North Korea is not interested in denuclearization and is instead focused on developing its weapons capabilities.

""This test shows that North Korea is still pursuing its long-term goal of becoming a nuclear-armed state and is not interested in giving up its weapons program,"" said Zhao Tong, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.

The missile test also comes at a time of heightened tensions between North and South Korea. Last month, North Korea criticized South Korea's annual military drills with the United States, calling them a ""serious provocation"" that could derail efforts to improve relations between the two countries.

South Korea's defense ministry said in a statement that it was analyzing the North's missile test and maintaining a ""strong defense posture"" in coordination with the United States.

""We call on North Korea to immediately stop developing its weapons program and return to the negotiating table for denuclearization,"" the ministry said.

The United States and Japan also condemned the missile test, with the White House saying it was ""aware"" of the launch and would consult with allies and partners. The Japanese government called the test a violation of United Nations resolutions and a threat to regional security.

The UN Security Council, which has imposed several rounds of sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear program, is expected to hold a closed-door meeting on Friday to discuss the missile test.

Despite the international condemnation, North Korea is unlikely to face any significant consequences for its latest provocation. The country has defied numerous UN resolutions and economic sanctions in the past, and has shown little willingness to change its behavior.

Experts say that the key to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is for the United States and South Korea to engage in sustained dialogue with North Korea, including a willingness to offer incentives for denuclearization.

""North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons unless it feels that it has adequate security guarantees and economic benefits from the United States and South Korea,"" said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.

""Without a bold and pragmatic approach to diplomacy, the North Korean nuclear issue will continue to pose a serious threat to regional stability for years to come.""",1
141,Lawsuit seeks to uphold closing California’s last nuke plant,"SACRAMENTO, California (AP) — Environmental groups have filed a lawsuit seeking to uphold the decision to close California’s last nuclear power plant, arguing that a company cannot defy state regulators.

The lawsuit filed Thursday in San Francisco Superior Court seeks to block the continued operation of the Diablo Canyon power plant until regulators can consider whether its operations can be made safer.

The state’s Public Utilities Commission approved the closure of the plant by its owners, Pacific Gas & Electric, in 2025. PG&E, however, has insisted that it will continue to operate the plant, claiming that its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission exempts it from state jurisdiction.

Environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and the Natural Resources Defense Council, argue that PG&E is wrong and that state regulators have the authority to close the plant.

“The Public Utilities Commission made a clear decision to close the plant, and PG&E cannot be allowed to flout that decision,” said Damon Moglen, senior strategic advisor at Friends of the Earth.

The groups argue that PG&E has a history of safety violations and that allowing it to continue operating the plant would put California residents at risk.

“The continued operation of Diablo Canyon poses a clear and present danger to public safety and the environment, and we must do everything we can to uphold the decision to close it,” said Ann Marie Calabria, director of the California office of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The lawsuit seeks to force PG&E to comply with the state’s decision to close the plant and to prevent the company from taking any actions that would extend the plant’s life beyond its scheduled closure in 2025.

In response, PG&E issued a statement that read, “The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the federal agency responsible for safety and licensing oversight of our nuclear facilities. Our operations at Diablo Canyon are within the scope of this federal agency’s jurisdiction, and we will continue to operate in compliance with their standards.”

PG&E also noted that it is committed to meeting the state’s goal of producing 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045 and that it has already made significant progress toward that goal.

The Diablo Canyon power plant has been a contentious issue in California since it was first proposed in the 1960s. Located on the coast between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the plant has been a major source of electricity for the state since it began operating in the 1980s.

However, concerns over safety and the environment have grown in recent years, and the state’s Public Utilities Commission voted in 2016 to close the plant when its current operating licenses expire in 2024 and 2025.

The decision was greeted with relief by environmental groups, who had long campaigned for the plant’s closure. However, PG&E’s insistence on keeping the plant open has put the decision in doubt and led to the filing of the current lawsuit.

California has set some of the most aggressive goals in the country for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources. The state is already generating a significant amount of its electricity from solar and wind power, and its efforts to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles are seen as a model for other states.

However, the continued operation of Diablo Canyon threatens to undermine those efforts, according to the environmental groups.

“Closing Diablo Canyon is a critical step toward achieving California’s climate goals and protecting the health and safety of our communities,” said Moglen. “We cannot allow a company to put profit ahead of the public interest and endanger the lives of millions of Californians.”

The lawsuit is expected to be heard in the coming months, and both sides say they are prepared to fight their case in court. Meanwhile, the fate of the Diablo Canyon power plant remains uncertain, and the dispute over its future is likely to continue to be a major issue in California’s ongoing efforts to combat climate change.",1
142,'Game of Thrones' prequel and 'Harry Potter' series are a go,"HBO has given the all-clear to two new series, one based on the “Game of Thrones” prequel and the other based on the beloved “Harry Potter” series.

The “Game of Thrones” prequel will be set thousands of years before the events of the original series and will explore the history of Westeros and the origins of the White Walkers. The series is currently titled “The Long Night” and will star Naomi Watts, Josh Whitehouse, and Miranda Richardson.

Meanwhile, the “Harry Potter” series will follow the story of the wizarding world’s preeminent villain, Lord Voldemort, and his rise to power. The series is currently without a title, but is said to be based on the book “Voldemort: Origins of the Heir” and will be produced by Warner Bros.

Fans of both franchises are excited at the prospect of new content – particularly “Game of Thrones” fans, who have been waiting for a follow-up series since the original show ended its eight-season run earlier this year.

With HBO’s deep pockets, both series are expected to be lavishly produced and full of action, drama, and magic. The “Game of Thrones” prequel is currently filming in Northern Ireland, while the “Harry Potter” series is still in its early stages of development.

Both shows are expected to debut sometime in the next year or two, though neither network has announced a specific release date. Regardless, fans have been waiting with bated breath for new material, and these two series are sure to satisfy even the most ardent of devotees.",1
143,Why Sen. Feinstein's absence is a big problem for Democrats,"In the aftermath of the 2020 election, the Senate Judiciary Committee has become a central battleground for Democrats and Republicans alike. With high-stakes confirmation battles and looming legislative fights, the committee’s work on issues like immigration, voting rights, and criminal justice reform will shape the future of American politics for years to come.

But one key player in this drama has been conspicuously absent: Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

The California senator, who served as the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee until last January, has largely stayed out of the spotlight in recent months. Her absence has raised questions about the role she will play in the coming months, and whether she is fit for the job in the first place.

At 87 years old, Feinstein is the oldest member of the Senate – a fact that has not gone unnoticed by her critics. In the past, she has faced criticism for her handling of contentious hearings, including those related to the Supreme Court nominations of Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

But it’s not just age that’s fueling the speculation about Feinstein’s future. In recent years, she has shown a tendency to buck the progressive wing of her party on issues like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, and some Democrats are growing increasingly frustrated with her more moderate approach.

There’s also the question of whether Feinstein has lost her touch when it comes to navigating the complex political terrain of the Senate. Her recent performance during the Barrett confirmation hearings – where she hugged and praised Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the committee – was widely criticized by her fellow Democrats.

Feinstein’s absence from the trenches of the Judiciary Committee is particularly notable now, as the panel gears up for what could be some of the most consequential battles of the Biden era. While Democrats hold a narrow majority in the Senate, their margin on the committee is even slimmer – just one seat. This means that every vote counts, and Democrats will need to be strategic and united if they hope to pass their legislative priorities.

But without a strong, experienced leader at the helm of the Judiciary Committee, that task becomes much more difficult.

Feinstein has not been entirely absent from the committee’s work in recent months. In February, she raised eyebrows when she appeared to praise Republican Sen. John Cornyn for his questioning of Merrick Garland during his confirmation hearing for Attorney General.

“I just wanted to thank Senator Cornyn for your comments,” Feinstein said at the time. “It’s so nice to see us working together.”

Given the starkly different visions of justice that Feinstein and Cornyn have championed over the years, her comments seemed to many to be a sign that she was losing her edge.

Feinstein’s office has declined to comment on her future plans, and the senator herself has been largely tight-lipped about her role on the Judiciary Committee going forward. But with crucial issues like immigration and voting rights on the agenda, Democratic leaders may need to make some tough decisions about Feinstein’s future sooner rather than later.

Already, influential voices within the Democratic Party are calling for change. Last month, Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, told POLITICO that he believes Feinstein should step down from her position on the Judiciary Committee.

But not everyone agrees. Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, told POLITICO that he believes Feinstein “still has her faculties and ability.”

“I think she should be judged by her performance,” Durbin said. “If she feels up to the job, she should stay.”

So what, exactly, is Feinstein’s performance like these days? It’s a difficult question to answer definitively, as the senator has kept a relatively low profile in recent months.

But in some ways, her recent track record mirrors that of the larger Democratic Party. After all, it was just a few months ago that progressive activists and commentators were wringing their hands over the fate of the party’s agenda under divided government. Now, with Democrats controlling both the White House and Congress, the focus has shifted to intra-party squabbles and competing visions for the future.

In this context, Feinstein’s absence from the forefront of the Judiciary Committee could be seen less as a liability for Democrats and more as a symptom of the party’s larger struggles to unite around a common agenda.

Still, with so much at stake in the coming months – both on the Judiciary Committee and across the broader political landscape – the question of Feinstein’s future remains an important one. Will she continue to lead her party’s efforts on major policy issues, or will she step aside for a new generation of progressive leaders?

Only time will tell. For now, the spotlight remains on the Judiciary Committee and its remaining members as they navigate the twists and turns of American politics in the 21st century.",1
144,Volcano spews ash cloud for 2nd day on Russia's Kamchatka,"Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia - For the second consecutive day, a volcano on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula has spewed a towering ash column, prompting authorities to warn of possible hazards for air traffic.

The Shiveluch volcano, which stands at a height of around 3,283 metres (10,771 feet), has intermittently released ash since last week. But on Tuesday and Wednesday, the ash clouds reached a height of almost 4,000 metres (13,123 feet), according to the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team.

The ash column has prompted concern for air traffic in the area, with the authorities advising planes to avoid the region. Residents of nearby settlements have also been advised to stay indoors with their windows shut to avoid inhaling the ash.

Shiveluch is one of the most active volcanoes in Kamchatka, a region which is home to some 29 active volcanoes. It last erupted in 2019, spewing ash and prompting temporary evacuations.

Volcanic eruptions are frequent occurrences in Russia's far eastern region, but the sheer height of the ash column has prompted renewed concern for the local population and authorities. The Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team has pledged to continue closely monitoring the situation.",1
145,U.S. renewable electricity surpassed coal in 2022,"In a major milestone for the U.S. energy sector, renewable electricity surpassed coal in 2022, according to a report released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The report, which analyses data from the first five months of 2022, found that renewable sources - primarily wind, hydropower, solar and geothermal - generated 21% of the country's electricity, compared to coal's 20%.

This marks a significant shift from just five years ago, when coal provided nearly a third of U.S. electricity and renewables made up only about 15%.

Experts say the shift reflects a number of trends, including a decline in the cost of renewable energy technologies, government incentives and policies aimed at boosting renewable energy development, and increasing public concern about climate change.

""The decline of coal and the rise of renewable energy reflects a long-term trend in the United States and around the world,"" said Alex Younger, a researcher at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.

""The cost of renewable energy technologies, particularly solar and wind, has plummeted in recent years, making them increasingly competitive with traditional sources of energy like coal.""

Younger also noted that government policies at the federal and state levels - including tax credits, mandates for utilities to invest in renewables and other incentives - have helped drive the shift towards renewable energy.

In addition, he said, public opinion has been shifting in favor of renewable energy, with more Americans expressing concerns about the environmental impact of fossil fuels and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""These factors are all reinforcing each other and creating momentum towards a more sustainable energy future for the United States,"" Younger said.

While the rise of renewable energy is good news for the environment, it has also presented challenges for utilities and energy markets.

For example, wind and solar power are intermittent sources of energy - meaning they only generate energy when the wind blows or the sun shines - which can create instability in the power grid and require backup sources of power to be available.

In addition, some utilities have struggled to adapt to the changing energy landscape, with some coal-fired power plants shutting down and leaving them with stranded assets and declining revenues.

Despite these challenges, experts say the shift towards renewable energy is likely to continue, as the cost of renewable energy technologies continues to fall and public demand for sustainable energy grows.

""Renewable energy is no longer a niche or alternative source of energy - it's becoming mainstream,"" said Younger.

""The challenge now is to continue to build out the infrastructure and storage capacity needed to ensure a reliable and resilient energy system as we move towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.""

In light of the EIA report's findings, some lawmakers and environmental advocates are calling for increased government investment in renewable energy research and development, as well as policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel use and promoting energy efficiency.

""Renewable energy is the future of our energy system - not just in the United States, but around the world,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, a proponent of renewable energy and climate action.

""We need bold action now to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, renewable energy future that works for everyone.""",1
146,"Taliban share rare, months-old audio from reclusive leader","The Taliban have released a rare audio recording believed to be from their reclusive leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada. The audio, which is said to be several months old, was shared on Tuesday via the group's official media channels.

In the recording, a voice believed to be that of Akhundzada discusses the peace talks with the United States and emphasizes the Taliban's commitment to ""the ongoing jihad"" in Afghanistan. The voice also dismisses the Afghan government's authority and calls on Afghan citizens to support the Taliban.

The release of this audio recording is significant as Akhundzada is known to be a highly secretive figure who rarely speaks in public or to the media. His last known public statement was in August 2019, shortly after the Taliban and the United States signed a historic peace deal in Doha, Qatar.

The Taliban have been stepping up their propaganda efforts in recent months, with a particular focus on promoting their image as a legitimate and viable alternative to the Afghan government. This audio recording is part of that effort, as the group seeks to legitimize their leadership and rally support among the Afghan population.

The release of the audio recording also comes as the Taliban have been making significant territorial gains in Afghanistan in recent weeks, seizing control of numerous districts and border crossings. The group now controls roughly a third of the country, according to some estimates.

The Taliban's resurgence has been a cause of concern for the Afghan government, as well as for regional powers such as India, Pakistan, and China. The United States, which is in the process of withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, has been trying to facilitate a political settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan government.

However, the peace talks have been slow and fraught with difficulties, with both sides accusing each other of bad faith and sabotage. The release of this audio recording could further complicate the negotiations and increase tensions between the two sides.

It remains to be seen what effect, if any, this audio recording will have on the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. However, it is a stark reminder that the Taliban remain a potent force in the country, with a leadership structure that is still intact despite years of US-led efforts to disrupt it.",1
147,"Márquez won't race in Americas MotoGP, cites hand injury","Reigning world champion, Marc Márquez, has announced that he will not be participating in the upcoming Americas MotoGP. The championship-winning rider has cited a hand injury as the reason for his withdrawal.

Márquez, who races for Repsol Honda, suffered the injury during a training session just over a week ago. Despite undergoing surgery to correct the problem, the Spaniard is still struggling with the injury and has chosen to rest rather than risk further damage.

""I'm disappointed not to be racing in Austin, but under doctor's orders, I am not in a position to do so,"" Márquez said in a statement. ""The hand is still not 100 percent, and it's better to wait and recover properly before returning to the track.""

The Americas MotoGP will take place over the weekend, from April 12-14, in Austin, Texas. This will be the fifth race of the season, and Márquez's absence from the grid will undoubtedly have an impact on the competition.

The rider's impressive track record at the Circuit of the Americas includes six victories from the six races he has participated in thus far. However, with Márquez out of the running, the field is wide open for one of his rivals to take the top spot.",1
148,Colman Domingo wants theater like 'Fat Ham' to happen more,"Colman Domingo, the Tony-nominated actor and playwright, is calling for more productions like 'Fat Ham' to take center stage in the world of theater. The groundbreaking play reimagines Shakespeare's classic play 'Hamlet' with an all-Black cast and set in the American South.

During a recent interview with AP News, Domingo said he believes it's important for theater to reflect the diversity of the world we live in. ""Theater should be a place where we can see ourselves reflected back, and not just one specific type of person,"" he said. ""There's room for everyone in theater.""

Domingo wrote 'Fat Ham' in response to a challenge from The Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, which asked him to write a play that explored the themes of 'Hamlet' while also being specifically tailored to an all-Black cast. The result is a powerful, soulful play that explores issues of family, loss, and the cost of revenge.

The reaction to 'Fat Ham' has been overwhelmingly positive, with many critics and audiences praising the play for its innovative approach to a classic story. Part of what makes the play so compelling is the way it challenges traditional notions of what Shakespeare's plays should look like. ""When you look at the canon of classic plays, they're usually dominated by white voices,"" Domingo said. ""But that's not the whole story.""

Domingo said he hopes 'Fat Ham' will inspire other theaters to be more adventurous in the kinds of plays they produce. ""It's important that we start seeing more diverse stories on stage,"" he said. ""There are so many different perspectives and experiences that are just waiting to be heard.""

Theater has long been a platform for social justice issues and has the power to shine a light on important topics. Domingo recognizes this power and the role that theater can play in pushing conversations forward. ""We have to be courageous in the stories we choose to tell,"" he said. ""We have to be willing to take risks.""

One of the biggest risks for 'Fat Ham' was the use of the N-word in the play's dialogue. It's a loaded word, and one that can be deeply divisive. But Domingo said he felt it was important to include it in the play, as it speaks to the history of Black people in America. ""The N-word has a lot of weight and context, and it's important that we keep confronting it as a society,"" he said. ""It's a word that's been used to dehumanize Black people, and we need to keep talking about that.""

At the end of the day, Domingo believes that theater should always seek to challenge and provoke its audiences. ""We should never be complacent in the stories we tell,"" he said. ""We need to keep pushing ourselves to be more courageous, more vulnerable, and more honest.""

As theater companies continue to explore new ways of telling stories, 'Fat Ham' is a timely reminder of the power of representation on stage. By sharing diverse experiences with audiences, theater can help build a more inclusive and just society.",1
149,Pitcher criticizes MLB teams for extending alcohol sales,"In a recent interview, professional baseball pitcher, Jake Thompson, expressed his disappointment with Major League Baseball (MLB) teams that have extended alcohol sales at their stadiums.

Thompson, who has played for multiple MLB teams, including the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers, argued that allowing alcohol sales to continue past the seventh inning stretch only serves to create a dangerous and potentially deadly environment.

""It's no secret that alcohol and sports go hand-in-hand,"" Thompson said. ""But when teams start extending sales, they're putting profits before the safety of their fans.""

Thompson added that he has seen numerous instances of fans becoming belligerent and aggressive toward opposing teams, as well as other fans, when consuming too much alcohol.

""It's not just rowdy behavior, either,"" Thompson continued. ""People are getting behind the wheel after games, and that's where things really start to get dangerous.""

Thompson's criticism comes in the wake of several teams announcing plans to extend alcohol sales at their stadiums this season. The Arizona Diamondbacks, for example, have announced plans to keep alcohol flowing until the end of the ninth inning. Other teams, such as the Kansas City Royals and Minnesota Twins, have similarly extended sales in recent years.

These moves have been met with criticism from some fans, as well as from groups that advocate for responsible alcohol use. Critics argue that extending alcohol sales serves only to increase the likelihood of drunk driving, fights and other incidents.

The MLB, for its part, has defended the decision to allow teams to extend alcohol sales. In a statement, the league acknowleged that it was important for teams to provide a fun and festive atmosphere for fans, but also said that it was committed to ensuring the safety of all attendees.

""We work closely with our teams to ensure the responsible use of alcohol at all of our stadiums,"" the statement read.

However, some players like Thompson remain unconvinced. He said that while he understands the importance of creating a fun atmosphere at games, he believes that the safety of fans should come first.

""At the end of the day, it comes down to priorities,"" Thompson said. ""I think it's clear that the safety and well-being of fans should always be our top priority.""

Other players, including some of Thompson's former teammates, have also expressed concerns over the issue. Phillies pitcher, Aaron Nola, said he worries that allowing alcohol sales to continue past the seventh inning stretch could lead to more incidents of fan violence.

""I've seen enough fights and arguments in the stands to know that alcohol can make people do things they normally wouldn't,"" Nola said.

Despite these concerns, however, it appears that the trend of extending alcohol sales at MLB games is likely to continue. Teams see alcohol sales as a key revenue stream, and as long as fans continue to buy beer and other beverages, the practice is unlikely to change.

For players like Thompson, however, the issue is about more than just profits. It's about keeping fans safe and ensuring that games remain a fun and enjoyable experience for all.

""I love the game of baseball, and I love the fans who come out to support us,"" Thompson said. ""But I believe that we can have a fun and exciting atmosphere at games without putting people at risk.""",1
150,"Brazil’s Lula visits China, seeking ties and Ukraine support","Former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is on a visit to China this week, hoping to strengthen ties between the two countries and garner support for Brazil's position on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

Lula, a left-leaning politician who served as president from 2003 to 2010, arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for his first visit to China since leaving office. During his time in China, he is scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping and other top officials in order to discuss a range of issues, including trade, investment, and diplomacy.

One of the key areas where Lula is likely to seek Beijing's support is in Brazil's ongoing dispute with Russia over its annexation of Crimea and ongoing support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Brazil, like many other countries, has condemned Russia's actions but has stopped short of imposing sanctions on Moscow, saying that it prefers diplomatic solutions to the conflict.

Lula's visit comes as relations between Brazil and Russia have come under increasing strain in recent years, with both countries accusing each other of protecting their own interests at the expense of the other. While both sides have expressed a desire to maintain good relations, the conflict in Ukraine has put a strain on bilateral ties and made it difficult for Brazil to pursue its own foreign policy objectives in the region.

China, meanwhile, has been a key ally of Russia throughout the crisis, with Beijing taking a largely hands-off approach to the conflict and refraining from condemning Moscow's actions. While Lula is unlikely to receive formal support for Brazil's position on Ukraine during his visit, he is likely to use his meetings with Chinese officials as an opportunity to discuss the issue and see if there is any scope for collaboration between the two countries.

Apart from seeking support on the Ukraine issue, Lula's visit to China is also aimed at strengthening economic ties between the two countries. China is Brazil's largest trading partner, with the two countries maintaining a busy trade relationship that is valued at over $100 billion annually.

During his stay in Beijing, Lula is expected to meet with business leaders and pitch investment opportunities in Brazil's infrastructure sector. The former president, who is widely credited with helping to spur Brazil's economic transformation during his time in office, has long been an advocate of increasing investment in infrastructure as a way of boosting growth and creating jobs.

Lula's visit to China is part of a broader campaign by the former president to re-establish himself as a key player in Brazilian politics. Despite being one of the most popular politicians in Brazil, Lula has been sidelined in recent years by a series of corruption scandals that have plunged his Workers' Party into crisis.

However, Lula has remained an influential figure in Brazilian politics, with many members of the party still looking to him for guidance and support. His visit to China is seen as an attempt to reassert his influence and position himself as a leading advocate for pro-growth, investment-friendly policies in Brazil.

While Lula is likely to find a receptive audience in China, analysts say that he will face challenges in his efforts to rebuild his political base at home. With Brazil facing a deep economic crisis and widespread public anger over corruption, the former president's efforts to turn his popularity into political power are likely to face stiff resistance from his opponents.

Nevertheless, Lula's visit to China is seen as an important step in his bid to reassert his influence and cement his legacy as one of Brazil's most dynamic and transformative leaders. As he continues to push for greater investment and expanded ties with Beijing, Lula could help to position Brazil as one of the world's leading emerging markets – and help to shape the future of global politics in the process.",1
151,Alabama lawmakers advance economic development bills package,"Alabama lawmakers are moving forward with a package of economic development bills designed to boost the state's economy and create jobs.

The package includes a number of measures aimed at increasing investment in the state's infrastructure, supporting small businesses, and attracting new companies to Alabama.

One of the key bills in the package is the Alabama Incentives Modernization Act, which would update and streamline the state's incentives program. The bill would consolidate a number of existing incentive programs into a single, more flexible program. This would make it easier for businesses of all sizes to take advantage of incentives, and would make Alabama more attractive to companies looking to locate or expand in the state.

Another important bill in the package is the Alabama Innovation Corporation Act. This would create a non-profit corporation dedicated to supporting and promoting innovation in the state, with a focus on technology and research-based businesses. The corporation would provide funding and other resources to help entrepreneurs and startups in Alabama to develop new ideas and bring them to market.

The package also includes measures to promote workforce development, including funding for vocational and technical training programs, and a program to provide incentives for businesses that hire apprentices.

In addition, the bills would create new tax breaks for small businesses, and would provide funding for infrastructure projects, such as roads and bridges, to help attract new industries to the state.

Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who has made economic development a priority during her time in office, praised the package of bills.

""These bills represent a major step forward in our efforts to create jobs and grow Alabama's economy,"" Ivey said in a statement. ""By investing in infrastructure, supporting small businesses, and attracting new industries to our state, we can improve the lives of Alabamians and strengthen our communities.""

The package of bills now heads to the Alabama Senate for consideration. If passed, the bills would then need to be signed into law by Governor Ivey before they could take effect.",1
152,"On 'Miracle-Level,' Deerhoof leaves its comfort zone","Experimental rock band Deerhoof has been releasing music for over two decades now, and with their latest release, ""Future Teenage Cave Artists,"" they have once again demonstrated their willingness to push boundaries and experiment with their sound. 

Deerhoof’s music has been described as avant-garde, noisy, and fragmented. In ""Future Teenage Cave Artists,"" they continue to explore this musical terrain but also bring a newfound clarity and focus to their approach. The album features catchy hooks, intricate arrangements, and lyrics that touch on themes ranging from the environment to the current political climate. 

Songs like ""The Loved One"" and ""Damaged Eyes Squinting into the Beautiful Overhot Sun"" showcase the band's ability to combine catchy melodies with intricate soundscapes. Meanwhile, tracks like ""Sympathy for the Baby Boo"" and ""O Ye Saddle Babes"" demonstrate the band's ability to create off-kilter, almost playful, musical vignettes. 

Perhaps the most impressive aspect of ""Future Teenage Cave Artists"" is how Deerhoof manages to fuse experimentation and accessibility without sacrificing their idiosyncratic sound. They have always been a “love them or hate them” kind of band, but ""Future Teenage Cave Artists"" feels like a cohesive artistic statement that could potentially win over new fans while still appeasing longtime followers. 

Deerhoof is a band that constantly pushes themselves outside of their comfort zone to create something new and exciting. On ""Miracle-Level,"" this is especially apparent. The album feels like a natural evolution of Deerhoof’s sound, and in doing so, the band has created one of the most interesting and unique albums of the year.",1
153,Moderna says potential flu vaccine needs more study,"Moderna Inc., a US-based biotechnology company, announced on Tuesday that they still need to conduct further research on their potential flu vaccine before it can advance to the next stage of clinical trials. The preliminary data from the clinical trials showed that the vaccine candidate has the potential to be effective against multiple strains of the flu virus.

According to a company spokesperson, the initial results of the study are promising, but more data is needed to assess the vaccine's safety and efficacy. Moderna is currently working on improving the vaccine's production to enable the production of large quantities in the future.

The company has been expanding its portfolio beyond the COVID-19 vaccine it developed in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. Moderna is planning to add several vaccines to its pipeline and eventually become a leading vaccine manufacturing company.

Moderna's announcement comes as the company continues to distribute its COVID-19 vaccine globally. As of August 2, Moderna has delivered about 200 million doses of its vaccine to over 40 countries.

Overall, the company's efforts to develop a new flu vaccine could have a significant impact, providing an additional tool to public health officials in the fight against seasonal influenza.",1
154,EPA car rule to push huge increase in EV sales,"Washington D.C. - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Thursday a new set of car and truck emissions rules, which it says will lead to a significant reduction in pollution across the country over the coming years.
 
The rules, which are still being finalized, have already been met with loud criticism from the car and oil industries, but praised by environmental groups and others who say that the United States needs to address its longstanding pollution problem.

One of the key aspects of the new rules is an effort to push automakers to produce a much larger share of electric vehicles (EVs), which are seen as key to reducing emissions in the transportation sector. Under the EPA's proposal, automakers would have to produce EVs that account for 17% of their sales by 2025, up from the current target of 10%.

The EPA says that this increase in sales would lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 2.4 billion tonnes through 2040, and save 450 billion litres of gasoline, and 950 million barrels of oil.

The targets for EVs are one part of a larger set of rules that are aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. The new rules would set tough tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles through 2026 and require automakers to improve fuel efficiency at the same rate as under the Obama-era rules that were first proposed in 2012.

The Trump administration moved to roll back these rules in 2018, but the Biden administration has pushed ahead with tougher standards as part of its efforts to tackle climate change.

The new rules have been met with criticism from the car industry, with some executives warning that the targets are too high and will be difficult to achieve, especially in the current climate.

But these concerns are not shared by everyone. Environmental groups and politicians who support the new rules have said that they believe they will lead to major improvements in air quality and help the United States get on a more sustainable path to a cleaner, healthier environment.

Some experts say that the push for EVs could have an even bigger impact on the auto industry. According to a recent report from Bloomberg NEF, the increased demand for EVs could push prices down, making them more affordable for consumers, and ultimately increasing sales even more.

The report predicts that sales of EVs will increase from 17 million globally in 2020 to 58 million in 2030, and to over 100 million in 2040. It suggests that the cost of EV batteries, which currently make up a large portion of the total cost of the vehicles, will continue to fall as new technology is developed, making EVs even more attractive to consumers.

Another factor that could help push EV sales even higher is the growing popularity of electric charging infrastructure. As more charging stations are deployed across the country, consumers are increasingly seeing EVs as a viable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars.

While some companies like Tesla have made a name for themselves with EVs, the push for EVs is putting pressure on traditional automakers to get in on the trend. Companies like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen have all recently made major commitments to EVs, with plans to invest billions of dollars in developing new models and factories.

But while the push for EVs is growing, challenges remain. Limited public charging infrastructure in rural areas, and a lack of awareness among consumers about how EVs work and their benefits, are just a few of the barriers that need to be overcome to reach the EPA's ambitious targets.

Despite these challenges, the push for EVs is still gaining momentum. Governments around the world, including the United States, are increasing incentives for consumers to buy EVs, and introducing stricter emissions standards that penalize the most polluting vehicles.

The EPA's new rules are just one aspect of this global push for change. But they could be one of the most significant, pushing automakers to produce more EVs and creating a broader shift toward alternative fuel vehicles that could help to reduce the United States' dependence on oil and gas, and ultimately lead to a cleaner, healthier environment.",1
155,Snyder agrees to $6.05B sale of NFL's Commanders,"In a surprise move, billionaire businessman Dan Snyder has agreed to sell his NFL team, the Washington Commanders, for a reported $6.05 billion dollars. The sale marks the end of Snyder's troubled tenure as owner of the franchise, which has been mired in controversy and disappointment for much of the past two decades.

The announcement was made on Wednesday morning, via a joint statement from Snyder and the buyers, who remain undisclosed at this time. According to sources close to the deal, negotiations have been ongoing for several months, but the final terms were only agreed upon in the last few days.

The sale price is a staggering sum, even by NFL standards. It's nearly $2 billion more than the previous record for an NFL team sale, set when the Carolina Panthers were sold for $2.275 billion in 2018. It's also more than three times what Snyder paid for the team when he bought it in 1999, for a reported $800 million.

The Commanders have long been one of the most valuable franchises in the NFL, despite their lackluster on-field performance in recent years. The team's brand and loyal fan base, combined with its location in the heart of the nation's capital, have made it an attractive investment for potential buyers.

Snyder, who made his fortune in the communications industry, has been one of the most controversial owners in the NFL since he took over the Commanders more than 20 years ago. He's been accused of everything from meddling in on-field decisions to creating a toxic workplace culture, with numerous reports of harassment, bullying, and discrimination within the organization.

The most notable scandal involving Snyder's tenure came to light last year, when a series of news reports uncovered widespread allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct within the Commanders' front office. The revelations prompted the NFL to launch an independent investigation, which ultimately led to a $10 million fine for the team and the forced resignation of several top executives.

Snyder also faced criticism from fans and media for his handling of the team's name, which he finally changed from the controversial ""Redskins"" to the more neutral ""Commanders"" in 2020, after years of resistance.

Despite these controversies, Snyder has remained committed to the team and has invested heavily in its future over the years. He's overseen multiple stadium renovations and expansions, as well as the construction of a state-of-the-art training facility and headquarters in Virginia.

But despite all these efforts, the Commanders have been largely unsuccessful on the field in recent years, failing to make the playoffs since 2015 and posting just three winning records in the past decade. The team has also struggled financially, with declining attendance and sponsorship revenue in recent years, even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

The sale of the team marks a new era for the Commanders and their long-suffering fans, who will no doubt be hoping for a fresh start under new ownership. The new owners will inherit a team with a young and promising roster, led by rising star quarterback Taylor Heinicke and standout defensive end Chase Young.

They'll also have the opportunity to build a new stadium for the team, as the Commanders' lease at FedExField, which they've called home since 1997, is set to expire in 2027. Snyder had been exploring potential sites for a new stadium in recent years, but no concrete plans had been announced.

It's not clear who the buyers are or what their plans are for the team, but some analysts are already speculating that it could be a consortium of wealthy investors or even a foreign buyer. The sale will also need to be approved by the majority of the NFL's owners, a process that could take several months.

Regardless of who ultimately takes over the team, one thing is clear: the Commanders are one of the most valuable franchises in the NFL, and they're now up for grabs to the highest bidder. The sale is a significant moment for the league and could have ripple effects on the values of other franchises in the future.

It also puts an end to Snyder's tumultuous reign as owner of the team, a period marked by controversy, disappointment, and missed opportunities. For Commanders fans, the sale may be bittersweet, a symbol of both hope and nostalgia for a team that has yet to reach its full potential.",1
156,"As streamers cut costs, TV shows — and residuals — vanish","As the streaming industry becomes a more dominant force in the entertainment world, traditional television is beginning to feel the effects of its popularity. Streaming services are not only creating their own hit shows but have also become the new home of many beloved shows from network TV. However, as streaming services cut costs, some of these shows are disappearing and with them, the residuals that actors rely on.

Residuals are payments made to actors, writers, and other creatives for the re-airing or rebroadcasting of a show or film. These payments give actors and writers a continuous stream of income long after a show has finished airing. However, in the world of streaming, residuals are becoming less common, leaving many actors wondering what their financial future will look like.

Take the case of NBC’s hit show The Office. When the show was on the air, actors such as Steve Carell, John Krasinski, and Mindy Kaling received residuals every time an episode aired on a network. Now that the show has found a new home on Peacock, the NBCUniversal-owned streaming service, the actors are no longer receiving residuals for the show's streaming views.

This is because of the difference in the way residuals are calculated for network TV versus streaming services. In network TV, residuals are based on the number of times an episode airs on a network, whereas in streaming services, they are based on the number of subscribers who view the content. According to the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), if a show airs 10 times on network television, an actor can earn up to $900 in residuals. However, if a show streams 10 times on a streaming service, an actor can earn as little as $10 in residuals.

The impact of this new calculation method is significant, as it implies that actors will earn less and less money from their shows as streaming services become the primary venue for entertainment. This situation is concerning for many actors, especially those who rely on residuals to pay their bills and plan for their future.

One solution that some in the industry are proposing is the creation of new contracts that would provide actors with residuals that are calculated differently for streaming services. However, this would require both streaming services and actors to come together and agree on a new standard for calculating residuals. This process could be difficult and prolonged, as both sides may not have the same priorities.

While actors may be the most affected by the move to streaming, they are not the only ones feeling the impact. Behind-the-scenes creatives, such as writers and directors, are also struggling to adapt to the changing landscape.

Under the old model, a writer or director could create a show, sell it to a network, and receive long-term residuals from every episode aired on that network. However, in the streaming era, the old method of calculating residuals is no longer applicable. Many streaming services, like Netflix, are not interested in purchasing shows, preferring instead to produce their own original content. This means that many writers and directors are being left out in the cold when it comes to receiving residuals.

This situation poses the question of what writers and directors should do to protect themselves in a world where residuals are not guaranteed. Some are suggesting that writers and directors should have an ownership stake in their shows, allowing them to earn money based on the success of the show, rather than just its initial sale. Others are calling for a renegotiation of contracts to ensure that creatives are being compensated fairly for their work.

The situation is not all doom and gloom, however. Some in the industry view the move to streaming as a positive thing, as it brings with it new opportunities for creators that did not exist previously. Streaming services are investing heavily in original content, which means that there are more opportunities for writers and directors to create their own shows and receive residuals on them.

Similarly, actors who may not have had a chance to be cast in mainstream network shows are now finding success on streaming services. Shows like Netflix’s Orange is the New Black and Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale have given a platform to actors who may not have been given the opportunity to showcase their talent on network TV.

The issue of residuals and the changing landscape of entertainment is a complex one, with no easy solutions. However, it is clear that some form of change needs to happen to ensure that creatives are being compensated fairly for their work. As streaming services continue to grow in popularity, it is essential that the industry come together to create a new standard for residuals that takes into account the changing ways in which people consume entertainment.

Until that happens, it remains to be seen how the world of television will continue to adapt to an ever-changing landscape, where streaming services reign supreme over traditional network TV.",1
157,Biden says he's expanding some migrants' health care access,"WASHINGTON D.C. (AP News) - President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he is expanding some migrants' health care access. The move is a reversal of a Trump-era policy that restricted access to health care for undocumented immigrants.

Biden made the announcement during a speech at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where he emphasized the importance of providing health care to all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

""We cannot deny health care to people who need it, especially during a pandemic,"" Biden said. ""It's a moral obligation and a public health necessity.""

The policy change will apply to individuals who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, as well as those who have Temporary Protected Status (TPS). DACA provides protection from deportation and work authorization to certain individuals who were brought to the United States as children, while TPS is granted to individuals from countries experiencing political or environmental unrest.

Under the new policy, individuals with DACA and TPS will be able to enroll in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provide health care coverage to low-income individuals and families. Additionally, these individuals will be able to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace.

Biden's decision to expand health care access to some undocumented immigrants has been met with resistance from conservative lawmakers, who argue that the move will encourage more individuals to come to the United States illegally.

""We cannot simply invite anyone and everyone to come to our country and receive free health care,"" said Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). ""That's not how our immigration system should work.""

However, supporters of the policy change argue that providing health care to all individuals is a basic human right and a necessary step towards ensuring public health.

""For too long, we have denied access to health care to some of the most vulnerable members of our society,"" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). ""Expanding health care access to individuals with DACA and TPS is the right thing to do, and it will make our communities healthier and more resilient.""

The policy change will impact approximately 940,000 individuals with DACA and TPS, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

Health care has been a contentious issue in the United States for many years, with disagreements over how best to ensure access to affordable, quality care for all individuals. The passage of the ACA in 2010 marked a significant shift towards providing health care coverage to more Americans, but efforts to repeal and replace the law have been ongoing in recent years.

Biden's announcement is part of a broader effort by his administration to expand access to health care and strengthen the ACA. Earlier this month, he signed an executive order creating a special enrollment period for the ACA marketplace, allowing uninsured individuals to sign up for health insurance until May 15.

In addition to expanding health care access to some undocumented immigrants, Biden has also proposed a number of other health care reforms, including increasing funding for community health centers, investing in public health infrastructure, and expanding Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing benefits.

""We must build a health care system that works for everyone,"" Biden said during his speech on Tuesday. ""That means providing affordable, accessible care to all individuals, regardless of their background or their immigration status.""

The policy change comes as the United States continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the need for robust public health infrastructure and access to care. The pandemic has also disproportionately impacted communities of color and low-income individuals, who are more likely to lack access to medical care.

Expanding health care access to some undocumented immigrants is one step towards addressing these disparities and ensuring that all individuals have the resources they need to stay healthy and safe.

In his speech on Tuesday, Biden emphasized that health care is a fundamental human right, and that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that all individuals have access to the care they need.

""Health care is a right, not a privilege,"" Biden said. ""And we must do everything in our power to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have access to the care they need to stay healthy and thrive in this country.""",1
158,"Michael Lerner, ‘Barton Fink’ Oscar nominee, dies at 81","Los Angeles, California - Michael Lerner, the actor best known for his role as Jack Lipnick in the 1991 film ""Barton Fink,"" has died at the age of 81.

Lerner's agent, Joel Lubin, confirmed the news of his passing to AP News on Tuesday. Lubin stated that the actor had passed away on Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles due to complications from pneumonia.

Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1941, Lerner began his acting career in the 1960s and appeared in various television shows and films throughout his career. He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of studio boss Jack Lipnick in the Coen Brothers' classic film ""Barton Fink"" in 1991, which earned him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards.

In a statement, Turturro remembered his time working with Lerner on the film, saying ""Michael was a mensch, a wonderful actor, and a great friend. He will be missed.""

Director Joel Coen also shared his condolences, stating ""Michael was a terrific actor and a lovely guy. We were fortunate to work with him on ‘Barton Fink’ and our hearts go out to his family and loved ones.""

Fans of Lerner's work also took to social media to express their sadness and pay tribute to his contributions to the entertainment industry.

The passing of Michael Lerner has come as a shock to many in Hollywood, with the actor having continued to work throughout his career. He was last seen on screen in the 2019 film ""The Truffle Hunters,"" and had several upcoming projects in the works at the time of his death.

While Lerner may no longer be with us, his legacy as an actor and as a teacher will live on through the numerous students and colleagues he inspired throughout his career.

As the entertainment industry mourns the loss of one of its most beloved actors, Michael Lerner will forever be remembered as a true talent who captivated audiences on screen and on stage alike. His passion for acting and his dedication to his craft will continue to inspire future generations of performers, ensuring that his legacy lives on for years to come.",1
159,Massive New Jersey Pine Barrens fire now fully contained,"A massive fire that scorched through the New Jersey Pine Barrens has now been fully contained, according to state officials. The blaze, which began last week, burned through more than 14,000 acres of wilderness in the southern part of the state.

Hundreds of firefighters from across the region worked around the clock to battle the flames, which at times reached up to tree canopies as high as 100 feet. The fire was so enormous that smoke was visible from Philadelphia, nearly 40 miles away.

Despite the intensity of the blaze, no injuries or fatalities were reported, and only a handful of homes and businesses were affected. Officials say the rapid response by firefighters and favorable weather conditions helped prevent the fire from causing more damage.

""The firefighters on the front lines, along with our partners from other agencies and volunteers, did an incredible job,"" said Richard J. Codey, the state's acting governor. ""Their bravery and dedication have prevented this fire from being even more devastating than it already was.""

The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but officials suspect that it may have been sparked by a lightning strike. The Pine Barrens, a heavily forested and ecologically sensitive region, has seen several major wildfires in recent years, including a 2019 blaze that burned through more than 11,000 acres.

As firefighters wrap up their work and begin to demobilize, Codey urged residents and visitors to continue to exercise caution and follow fire safety guidelines. ""While the danger has passed for now, we must remain vigilant and take steps to prevent future fires from occurring,"" he said. ""We owe it to ourselves, our neighbors, and our environment to be responsible and careful.""",1
160,Weinstein returns to NY prison system after LA conviction,"Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced former Hollywood film producer, has returned to the New York prison system after being convicted on sexual assault and rape charges in Los Angeles.

Weinstein was sentenced to prison in March of 2020 for the sexual assault of a former production assistant and the third-degree rape of a woman in 2013. He was sentenced to 23 years in prison, with a minimum of 20 years to serve before being eligible for parole. He was then extradited to Los Angeles, where he faced additional charges.

In Los Angeles, a jury found Weinstein guilty of first-degree sexual assault and third-degree rape in September of 2021. He faced up to 140 years in prison for those convictions. However, a Los Angeles judge sentenced Weinstein to an additional 11 years in prison, bringing his total prison time to 34 years. 

Now, Weinstein is back in the New York prison system serving out his sentence. While he was briefly held at the Wende Correctional Facility in New York, he was quickly transferred to the maximum-security prison, the Auburn Correctional Facility.

Weinstein's legal troubles began in 2017 when a number of women accused him of sexual assault and harassment, sparking the #MeToo movement. His conviction in New York was seen as a victory for the movement, which aimed to hold powerful men accountable for their actions.

In Los Angeles, Weinstein faced separate but similar accusations of sexual misconduct. Prosecutors argued that he used his power in the industry to intimidate and sexually assault women. This conviction was also seen as a victory for victims of sexual misconduct.

Weinstein’s legal team has indicated that they plan to appeal the conviction. His appeal is based on a number of factors, including the judge’s decision to allow evidence from other accusers to be presented during trial. However, legal experts say that Weinstein faces a steep uphill battle in his appeals process.",1
161,Year is off to a deadly start for migrants crossing Med,"The year 2021 has already proven to be a deadly one for migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea. According to the International Organization for Migration, at least 500 migrants have died in the first two months of the year.

This is a tragic continuation of the crisis that has plagued the Mediterranean for years. Migrants, many of whom are fleeing poverty, violence or persecution in their home countries, often take to the sea in overcrowded or unseaworthy boats. They face treacherous conditions, including rough seas and sudden storms, and are often at the mercy of smugglers who exploit their desperation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has added an extra layer of danger to this already perilous journey, with many migrants lacking access to adequate healthcare and sanitation. In addition, travel restrictions and border closures in response to the pandemic have made it difficult for migrants to reach Europe through legal channels, forcing them to turn to smugglers and dangerous sea crossings.

The Mediterranean has long been a deadly route for migrants, with thousands losing their lives in recent years. The situation has been worsened by a lack of coordinated action by European governments, who have struggled to agree on a common approach to addressing the crisis.

Some European countries have taken steps to support search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean. In January, for example, the Spanish government announced that it would be sending a navy vessel to help search for migrants in distress off the coast of Libya. Other countries, however, have taken a more restrictive stance, closing their borders and making it more difficult for migrants to obtain asylum.

This lack of cooperation has only served to perpetuate the crisis, with migrants continuing to take dangerous risks in order to reach Europe.

There are no easy solutions to the Mediterranean migrant crisis. Addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty and conflict, is a complex and long-term challenge. In the short-term, however, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the number of deaths and provide support for those who do make it to Europe.

One key step is to increase search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean. Organizations like the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations Refugee Agency have called for more resources to be devoted to rescuing migrants at sea. In addition, some NGOs have stepped in to fill the gap left by governments, providing search and rescue services and medical assistance to migrants.

Another important step is to establish safe and legal pathways for migration to Europe. This could include expanding refugee resettlement programs, creating more opportunities for family reunification, and increasing work and study visas.

Finally, it is crucial for European governments to work together to develop a coordinated and humane approach to the migrant crisis. This means working together to establish a fair and equitable asylum system, sharing the burden of hosting refugees, and addressing the root causes of migration.

The situation in the Mediterranean is a tragic reminder of the human cost of failed migration policies. It is essential for European governments to take action to address the crisis and protect the lives of those who make the perilous journey across the sea.

The deaths of 500 migrants in just the first two months of the year are a sobering reminder of the urgent need for action. It is time for governments to come together to find solutions that prioritize the safety and dignity of all people, regardless of where they come from.",1
162,Dior transforms Mumbai's Gateway of India into fashion ramp,"MUMBAI, INDIA - Global luxury fashion giant Dior has transformed Mumbai's iconic Gateway of India monument into a dazzling fashion ramp – the first event of its kind in India.

Dior hosted its 2021 Cruise collection on Sunday night amid the stunning backdrop of the Arabian Sea.

The event included an elaborate light show, stunning fireworks, and a collection inspired by the rich Indian heritage and culture.

The Gateway of India monument, built during British rule, is a significant landmark in Mumbai and a popular tourist site. It was an ideal location for Dior's latest fashion show.

163,Russia might discuss swap for jailed US reporter,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian officials said they may consider exchanging a jailed Russian national for an American reporter detained in Iran.

The potential swap, suggested by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, came after the detention of several U.S. journalists in recent months raised concerns about press freedoms and human rights in the country. Lavrov said the Russian government would be willing to discuss such a deal with the United States, although no formal negotiations have taken place.

The detained American reporter in question is Jason Rezaian, the former Tehran bureau chief for The Washington Post. Rezaian was arrested in July 2014 and accused of espionage, a charge that he denies. He has been held in Iran for more than two years without a trial, prompting widespread condemnation from media organizations and human rights advocates.

The Russian national that could be offered in exchange is Kushnir Andrey, who was arrested in Russia in 2014 and charged with possession of illegal drugs. Andrey has denied the charge and his lawyer has argued that the case against him is politically motivated.

At a press conference in Moscow on Friday, Lavrov said that the United States had expressed interest in discussing the possibility of a prisoner exchange.

""We have received signals from the other side,"" Lavrov said. ""They are interested in it. We are not against it.""

Lavrov added that any exchange would require the approval of the two countries' leaders and would be subject to certain conditions.

""We are ready to consider various options, but they should be based on mutual respect and the rights of our citizens,"" Lavrov said.

The possibility of a swap for Rezaian has been raised by U.S. officials in the past, but it is unclear whether the Trump administration would be willing to pursue such a deal given its confrontational relationship with Russia.

Rezaian's case has already been a source of tension between the United States and Iran, and a swap could further complicate relations between the two countries.

The American journalist's family has been fighting for his release, with his brother urging President Donald Trump to do more to secure his freedom.

""We hope and pray that our brother will be released from confinement soon,"" Ali Rezaian said in a statement. ""We call on President Trump to continue pressing for Jason's release and to use his administration's resources to bring him home.""

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are currently at least 262 journalists jailed around the world, including Rezaian and several other Americans.

In a statement, the CPJ called on the Iranian government to release Rezaian immediately and unconditionally.

""Jason Rezaian has suffered an unconscionable abuse of his human rights,"" said Nina Ognianova, CPJ's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator. ""He has been imprisoned without due process or access to legal counsel for more than two years. The Iranian government must take immediate steps to release him.""

The CPJ also urged the U.S. government to do more to protect the rights of journalists and press freedom both domestically and abroad.

""The imprisonment of journalists is a clear violation of their right to report the news and inform the public,"" Ognianova said. ""Governments must respect the vital role that the media plays in a free and democratic society.""

The potential prisoner swap between Russia and the United States comes amid growing tensions between the two countries over a range of issues, including allegations of Russian interference in last year's U.S. presidential election and ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

It is unclear whether the two sides will be able to reach a deal, but both Lavrov and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have expressed a willingness to improve relations.

""We are willing to work with Russia on areas where we can find areas of mutual interest,"" Tillerson said at a recent meeting with Lavrov in Moscow. ""We remain committed to the importance of constructive dialogue and cooperation with Russia.""",1
164,"In Africa's Okavango, oil drilling disrupts locals, nature","The Okavango Delta region in Africa has long been a hub for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers due to its unique ecology and stunning landscapes. However, the recent emergence of oil drilling operations is putting the region's delicate balance at risk, causing concern among locals and nature conservationists alike.

The Okavango Delta, located in northern Botswana, is a vast wetland area that covers approximately 15,000 square kilometers. The region is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including elephants, lions, cheetahs, hippos, and countless bird species.

In recent years, however, the Botswana government has granted a number of concessions to foreign energy companies to explore and extract oil and gas reserves in the area. While these drilling operations have the potential to bring in significant revenue for the country, they also threaten to damage the Okavango's fragile ecosystem and disrupt the livelihoods of local communities who depend on the region's natural resources.

According to conservation experts, oil drilling can have a range of negative impacts on the environment, including disruptions to water sources, soil erosion, and air pollution. These effects can be especially damaging in areas like the Okavango Delta, which are particularly vulnerable to changes in their natural balance.

In addition, the introduction of oil drilling operations can also displace local communities who rely on the region's natural resources for their livelihoods. This is a major concern for both indigenous groups who have lived in the area for generations, as well as migrant workers who have settled in the region to work in the tourism industry.

One such group is the San people, an indigenous community who have historically inhabited the region for thousands of years. The San people have a deep understanding of the region's natural systems and have developed unique practices for managing its resources sustainably. However, the emergence of oil drilling operations is threatening to displace these communities, as well as their traditional knowledge and practices.

The effects of these developments are not limited to local communities, however. The Okavango Delta is also a key tourism destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to appreciate the region's natural beauty and biodiversity. The emergence of oil drilling operations in the area not only poses a risk to the region's ecology, but also to its reputation as a world-class travel destination.

Many conservationists and activists in Botswana and around the world have expressed concern about the government's decision to grant concessions for oil drilling operations in the Okavango Delta. They argue that while the short-term economic benefits of these operations may be significant, the long-term ecological and social costs are likely to be far greater.

Some have called for a moratorium on oil drilling in the region, citing the need to protect the Okavango's unique natural systems for future generations. Others have urged the Botswana government to reconsider its approach to economic development, prioritizing sustainable practices over short-term gains.

Despite these concerns, some argue that oil drilling operations can be carried out in a way that minimizes harm to the environment and respects the rights and needs of local communities. They point to examples of successful oil drilling operations in other parts of the world, where companies have worked with local communities to develop sustainable practices and preserve the integrity of the local environment.

However, critics remain skeptical about the ability of these developments to truly benefit local communities and preserve the Okavango Delta's delicate balance. They argue that the negative impacts of these operations are likely to be far-reaching and long-lasting, outweighing any potential economic benefits.

The emergence of oil drilling operations in the Okavango Delta highlights the ongoing tension between economic development and environmental conservation in many parts of the world. While these projects may bring immediate economic benefits, they also pose significant risks to the natural systems and local communities that sustain us all.

As the debate over the future of the Okavango Delta continues, it is clear that conservationists, local communities, and policymakers must work together to find a sustainable path forward. This will require a thorough understanding of the ecological, social, and economic factors at play, as well as a commitment to balancing short-term gains with long-term sustainability.",1
165,TikTok fined $15.9M by UK watchdog over misuse of kids' data,"TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, has been fined $15.9 million by the UK’s data watchdog after it was found that the platform had failed to protect children’s personal data.

The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said that TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, failed to obtain explicit consent from parents for processing their children’s data and failed to provide adequate information about the type of data being collected and its scope.

The investigation was launched in November 2019, following concerns raised by various child protection groups, who alleged that the app was not doing enough to protect minors from inappropriate content and potential predators.

The ICO found that TikTok had been collecting personal data such as first and last names, dates of birth, email addresses, and location information from under-13s without parental consent, which is a violation of data protection laws.

The watchdog also found that TikTok’s default settings were set to public, meaning that anyone could view a child’s profile and access their personal data. The app had failed to provide adequate controls to limit the visibility of children’s profiles and videos, leading to a risk of exposure to inappropriate content and grooming by predators.

In response to the fine, TikTok said that it has made several changes to the app over the past year to enhance privacy and safety features for children.

A spokesperson for the company said: “Privacy and safety are top priorities for TikTok and we have robust policies, processes and technologies in place to help safeguard all users, and our younger users in particular.”

“We believe the best way to ensure that TikTok is a safe and welcoming place for all users, is to invest in our trust and safety teams, and to improve the app’s functionality and controls.”

The company has also established a “Family Pairing” feature, which allows parents to link their accounts with their children’s accounts, giving them greater control over content viewing and privacy settings.

The ICO’s action is seen as a warning to other social media platforms to take the protection of children’s personal data seriously or face similar penalties.

The watchdog has conducted similar investigations into other large tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, over their use of children’s data, but this is its first such enforcement action against TikTok.

Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham said: “TikTok failed to take appropriate measures to protect the personal data of its younger users from inappropriate processing. This is a direct breach of GDPR and the UK’s Data Protection Act. The company should have made sure that parents had control over their children’s data and that children understood how their data was being used.”

“This is a message to all online companies operating in the UK that children’s privacy must be treated as a priority and that companies have a legal duty to protect children’s personal data.”

The fine follows a $5.7 million settlement that TikTok reached with the United States Federal Trade Commission in 2019. The FTC had accused the app of illegally collecting the personal information of children under the age of 13 without parental consent, which is a violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.",1
166,Raptors eye busy summer after falling short of expectations,"TORONTO (AP) – It was a disappointing end to the season for the Toronto Raptors, who failed to make a deep postseason run after reaching the Eastern Conference Finals in the NBA's Orlando bubble last year.

Despite the supporting cast of experienced players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam, the Raptors fell short of expectations in a season that was derailed by injuries and COVID-19 setbacks.

But as the offseason begins, the Raptors organization is looking to retool the roster and bounce back in the coming season.

“Obviously, this season wasn't what we wanted it to be,” Raptors president Masai Ujiri said in his season-ending press conference. “We want to win. We want to compete … and we're going to do whatever it takes to put ourselves in that position.”

Ujiri mentioned that the Raptors are looking to make some changes to the roster this summer, indicating there could be some new faces in Toronto next season.

“We're going to look at everything,” he said. “We're going to shake it up. We're going to see.”

One possible change could be the departure of Kyle Lowry, who will enter free agency this summer after spending nine seasons with the Raptors. Lowry has been a key player for the Raptors throughout his tenure with the team, helping the team win its first NBA championship in 2019.

Despite his age, 35, Lowry still has a lot to offer, and it's possible that the Raptors could try to re-sign him. But if he were to leave, it would open up some cap space for the team to sign other players.

Another area of concern for the Raptors is the frontcourt. Pascal Siakam struggled at times this season after being hampered by injuries and COVID-19 setbacks. The Raptors may look to add some depth to the frontcourt to help take some of the pressure off of Siakam.

“We're going to explore all possibilities,” Ujiri said. “We're going to look at the players we have, the contracts we have, and we're going to evaluate.”

In addition to exploring the possibility of roster changes, the Raptors will also be focusing on player development this offseason. The team's young players, including Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and Malachi Flynn, showed flashes of potential this season and will be expected to continue to improve next year.

“We want to keep evolving,” Ujiri said. “We want to keep getting better. We want to keep developing the young guys.”

One player who could see a significant role with the Raptors next season is center Chris Boucher. The Canadian-born big man averaged 13.6 points and 6.7 rebounds per game this season and showed flashes of being a dominant force on both ends of the court.

“He's a ball of energy,” Ujiri said of Boucher. “He's somebody that we're really proud of. … He's a major part of our program.”

The Raptors will also need to address their three-point shooting. Toronto finished second last in the league in three-point percentage during the regular season, shooting just 34.5% from beyond the arc.

“We have to improve in that area,” Ujiri said. “It's something that we're all aware of.”

The Raptors could also benefit from a change of scenery next season. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Raptors played their home games in Tampa, Florida, this year, which was a difficult adjustment for the team. It's unclear if the Raptors will be able to play in Toronto next season, but Ujiri said the team would welcome any opportunity to return to their home city.

“Home is home,” he said. “It's where your heart is. It's where your roots are. It's where your family is.”

Despite a disappointing season, the Raptors remain optimistic about their future. With a strong team culture and a commitment to player development, the Raptors are hoping to bounce back in the coming season and be a competitive force in the Eastern Conference.

“We have a lot of things to be proud of,” Ujiri said. “We're not trading our championship or what we've done in the past for anything. We're going to continue to build.”",1
167,"Al Jaffee, longtime Mad magazine cartoonist, dead at 102","Al Jaffee, the brilliant and iconic cartoonist who spent more than 65 years at Mad magazine crafting some of the most memorable and hysterical content, has passed away at the age of 102. The news of his death was announced on Thursday, July 23, 2020, by his son, Peter Jaffee.

Jaffee was a man of many talents who made an indelible mark on the world of comics and humor. He was a master of the comedic art of the “fold-in,” a back-page feature in Mad that involved folding the page to reveal a new, often absurd, image and punchline. His other contributions included “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions,” “Mad Fold-in,” and a host of spot illustrations, comic strips, and everything in between.

Jaffee was born on March 13, 1921, in Savannah, Georgia, to Jewish immigrant parents from Lithuania. Raised in Brooklyn, he began drawing cartoons as a child, and by the age of 17, he had already sold his first cartoon to a national publication. Drafted into the army during World War II, he served as a baker, but his talents were quickly recognized, and he was soon transferred to the Special Services Unit, where he created a comic strip for the army’s newspaper.

After the war, Jaffee worked as a freelance cartoonist for various publications, including Time magazine, and in 1955, he was hired by Mad magazine, where he stayed until his retirement in 2020. His impact on the publication was immense; Jaffee was not only a prodigious cartoonist—he also served as the art director for Mad and mentored generations of cartoonists and artists who passed through the magazine’s doors.

Perhaps his most recognizable contribution was the “fold-in,” which debuted in 1964 and quickly became a signature feature of Mad. Jaffee’s fold-ins were deceptively simple yet masterfully executed works of comic genius. Each installment began with a seemingly straightforward illustration, such as a world leader or a celebrity. But when readers folded the page, a hidden image or message would emerge, often poking fun at the subject or commenting on contemporary issues.

Aside from his fold-ins, Jaffee was also the creator of “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions,” a feature that lampooned the absurdity of people’s queries by pairing them with the most outrageous and inappropriate retorts imaginable. He was also responsible for many other comic strips, illustrations, and gags, including the memorable “Mad Fold-in,” “Hawkman” and “Tall Tales.”

But Jaffee’s contributions to the world of humor extended beyond Mad magazine. He collaborated with fellow cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman on numerous projects, including the comic book series “Little Annie Fanny,” which ran in Playboy for more than two decades. He also published several books, including “Al Jaffee’s Mad Life: A Biography” (2010) and “Al Jaffee’s Mad Book of Magic and Other Dirty Tricks” (1989), and was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Reuben Award, the National Cartoonists Society’s highest honor.

Jaffee’s cartoons were beloved for their wry, whimsical, and often subversive humor. With his brilliant wordplay, smart observations, and impeccable timing, he delighted generations of readers while simultaneously poking fun at the absurdities of daily life.

News of Jaffee’s passing was met with a flood of tributes from fellow cartoonists, comedians, and fans who had grown up reading his work.

“Al Jaffee was a true original—he created a format and style that have been imitated, but never duplicated,” said Dave Gibbons, the artist of “Watchmen,” in a tweet. “Thanks for inspiring so many of us.”

Comedian John Hodgman called Jaffee “a legendary cartoonist, satirist, and humorist—an undeniable genius and massive influence on generations of other artists.”

“Goodbye Al Jaffee,” tweeted Weird Al Yankovic. “Everybody in the world loved your work.”

Mad magazine, which celebrated its 67th anniversary in 2020, has been a pillar of American humor since its debut in 1952. Over the years, it has featured some of the most celebrated cartoonists, writers, and satirists of the 20th century, including Kurtzman, Will Elder, Mort Drucker, and Don Martin, among many others.

But for Mad fans, Jaffee’s contributions stood out as some of the magazine’s most memorable and enduring. His fold-ins were a highlight of every issue, and his other work—whether a four-panel strip or a full-page illustration—never failed to hit the mark.

Jaffee’s passing marks the end of an era in American humor. But his legacy will live on through the countless artists and cartoonists he inspired and through the many laughs and smiles he brought to millions of readers over the years.

Al Jaffee was a true original, whose brilliant wit and artistic talent will be sorely missed. But his work will continue to shine as a testament to his incredible legacy and to the power of laughter to bring joy and light to even the darkest corners of life.",1
168,TikTok's parent has a new app,"TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, has launched a new app called Resso. The music streaming app aims to change the way people interact with music by emphasizing engagement and social sharing, in a similar fashion to TikTok.

The app has been under development since 2018 and has already launched in India and Indonesia, with plans to expand into more markets in the future. Resso has already gained significant attention, with over 27 million downloads globally since its launch.

Resso allows users to stream music from major labels such as Sony Music, Warner Music Group, and Universal Music Group, as well as featuring independent artists. The app offers a unique experience by allowing users to share lyrics and comments synced with the music they are listening to. This creates a social experience that fosters interaction and communication between users, as well as between artists and their fans.

The app has already gained support from a variety of artists including Katy Perry and Marshmello, who have promoted their music through the platform. Resso has also partnered with Indian label T-Series, which has a massive following in the country.

ByteDance's decision to enter the music streaming market could be seen as a strategic move to diversify their offerings and compete with established services such as Spotify and Apple Music. However, given that Resso is more focused on social interaction, it may not directly compete with these services.

While ByteDance has been successful with TikTok, the company is no stranger to controversy. The app has faced several challenges, including concerns over user privacy, allegations of censorship, and scrutiny from the US government over national security concerns.

It remains to be seen how successful Resso will be, but ByteDance appears to be confident in the app's potential. In a statement to Reuters, a spokesperson for the company said, ""We are optimistic about the long-term potential of the music streaming industry and believe that interactive music experiences can bring about a new era for the industry.""

The music streaming market is a competitive space, but Resso's focus on social interaction and engagement could set it apart from its competitors. With TikTok's success, it's clear that ByteDance has a talent for creating engaging and innovative apps, and Resso may prove to be another success story for the company.

In India, Resso has been received positively by users, who appreciate the app's social aspects. ""I love how it lets me see the lyrics and comment on them. It's like I'm having a conversation with the song,"" said one user.

However, the app's freemium model has received criticism. While users can stream music for free with ads, they need to pay a fee for additional features such as downloading songs for offline listening.

Despite this, Resso's success in India has encouraged ByteDance to expand its presence in the country, which is already one of TikTok's biggest markets. The company is reportedly in talks with music labels and popular Bollywood artists to boost its content offerings.

In Indonesia, Resso has also gained traction, particularly among younger audiences. The app's social features have been embraced by users, who enjoy the opportunity to engage with other fans and artists. ""It's like my own personal party with my friends and favorite music,"" said one user.

The global rollout of Resso is still in its early stages, but it's clear that there is an appetite for the app's unique features. The success of TikTok has shown that ByteDance has the ability to create engaging and popular apps, and Resso may prove to be another example of this.

However, the company will need to address concerns around privacy and censorship to ensure that the app can operate in a way that is both responsible and enjoyable for its users. With its focus on social interaction and engagement, Resso has the potential to disrupt the music streaming market and create a new way for fans to connect with their favorite artists.

In conclusion, Resso is ByteDance's answer to the music streaming space, and it could not have come at a better time. As music streaming continues to soar in popularity globally, Resso could offer a fresh take on the industry with its focus on social interaction and engagement. It remains to be seen how the app performs in the long run, but it is clear that Resso is an exciting development that is worth keeping an eye on.",1
169,Paying for paradise? Hawaii mulls fees for ecotourism crush,"HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii, a popular destination for tourists seeking sun, sand, and waves, is considering charging visitors to support the state's fragile environment and to better manage its tourism industry.

It's an idea that gained traction even before the coronavirus pandemic brought Hawaii's tourism-dependent economy to a screeching halt. Hawaii, like many other destinations around the world, has long grappled with balancing the economic benefits of tourism with the environmental impact of visitors.

But the urgency has only grown as the state looks to rebuild its economy post-pandemic while still preserving its natural beauty, cultural resources, and delicate ecosystems. Hawaii is also emerging as a leader in the movement to address the issue of ""overtourism"" — the problem of too many visitors overwhelming a destination.

The push for a so-called tourist tax or ecotourism fee has been gaining momentum in the state's Legislature, where various proposals have been introduced in recent years. Some advocates have also called for a ""green fee"" on rental cars, which make up a significant portion of the state's tourism industry.

But the proposals have been met with mixed reactions from both tourists and local residents who would also face the fees. Some worry it would deter visitors, who are already paying for lodging, meals, and tourist activities on top of airfare. Others argue that it's a necessary step toward sustainable tourism.

Hawaii's tourism industry has grown significantly over the past decade, with a record 10.4 million visitors in 2019, according to data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The industry generates $17.75 billion in visitor spending and $2 billion in state taxes, according to the authority.

But the influx of visitors has also put a strain on the environment and infrastructure, including the state's narrow highways, water supply, and waste management. Tourism-related activities have also impacted Hawaii's natural resources, including coral reefs, beaches, and forests.

""We're in a situation where we're loving ourselves to death,"" said Stewart Yerton, a reporter for Honolulu Civil Beat who has been covering the issue. ""The state has to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the preservation of the things that make Hawaii special.""

The proposed fees, if implemented, would generate revenue to fund conservation efforts, support local communities, and improve tourism infrastructure. Supporters also argue that it would help reduce the number of visitors, particularly those who come for short stays or overcrowd popular attractions.

""Tourism can't just be about getting more people here,"" said Marti Townsend, director of the Sierra Club of Hawaii. ""We have to think about how we can manage and mitigate the impacts of tourism.""

Townsend's organization has been a vocal supporter of a tourist tax, saying it's a fair way to generate revenue from those who benefit from Hawaii's tourism industry the most. She said the fee could be based on the number of nights a visitor stays or the amount of money they spend on activities and accommodations.

Other tourism-dependent destinations have already implemented similar fees. Venice, Italy, for example, charges a ""landing tax"" on visitors who arrive by cruise ship, while Amsterdam, Netherlands, collects a ""tourist tax"" on hotel stays. Several U.S. national parks also recently raised entrance fees to support conservation efforts.

But critics argue that the fees could be counterproductive, reducing the number of visitors and hurting the state's economy. Hawaii's tourism industry is the largest employer in the state, providing jobs for more than 200,000 people, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority.

""Hawaii has always relied on tourism to support its economy,"" said Daniel Ross, a tourist from California. ""I'm not sure it's a good idea to start charging even more fees on top of everything else visitors already have to pay for.""

Local residents, who have long complained about overcrowding and traffic, have also expressed concerns about the potential fee. Some worry that it could exacerbate economic inequality, as low-income residents may not be able to afford the extra cost.

""The people who live in Hawaii are already struggling to make ends meet,"" said Kamalani Keliikuli, a resident of Oahu. ""I don't think it's fair to ask them to pay even more just because we have so many tourists.""

The proposed fees also face legal hurdles, as the state's Constitution prohibits taxing visitors without approval from the Legislature and governor. Any new fees would also need to be approved by the state's tourism industry, which has already been hit hard by the pandemic.

But advocates say that the pandemic has only underscored the need for a more sustainable tourism industry. With travel restrictions in place and a greater emphasis on outdoor activities, Hawaii has seen a surge in demand for ecotourism and cultural experiences.

""The pandemic has highlighted the importance of preserving our natural and cultural resources,"" Townsend said. ""We need to take this opportunity to rethink tourism and make sure that it's sustainable.""

As the state continues to explore ways to manage its tourism industry, the debate over the proposed fees is likely to continue. But one thing is clear: Hawaii, with its unique culture, history, and environment, must find a way to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the need to protect its natural assets for future generations.",1
170,Here are the countries that have bans on TikTok,"In recent months, the popular video-sharing app TikTok has faced scrutiny and bans from various countries over concerns regarding the app's privacy policies and its ties to the Chinese government.

TikTok, owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, has been downloaded over 2 billion times worldwide and has seen immense popularity among young users, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the app has been under fire for allegedly sharing user data with the Chinese government, thereby posing a risk to national security. The following are the countries that have either banned or imposed limitations on TikTok.

India
In June 2020, the Indian government banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok, citing concerns over national security and privacy. The move came amid a tense border dispute between India and China, prompting the Indian government to block access to apps that were deemed to be ""engaged in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India.""

The ban on TikTok was a major setback for the app, given that India had been its largest market, with over 200 million users. It also resulted in a loss of revenue for the company, with estimates suggesting a potential loss of about $6 billion.

United States
The United States has been one of the most prominent countries to announce a potential ban on TikTok. In August 2020, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that gave the app 45 days to find a buyer or face a ban in the country.

The order cited national security concerns, alleging that TikTok was collecting data on American citizens and sharing it with the Chinese government. The app's parent company, ByteDance, denied these allegations, but the move led to a frenzy among American users, with many scrambling to find alternatives to TikTok.

In September 2020, Oracle Corporation and Walmart jointly announced that they would acquire a 20% stake in a new company called TikTok Global, which would oversee operations in the United States. However, the deal is pending approval from both the United States and Chinese governments, and TikTok's fate in the country remains unclear.

Pakistan
In October 2020, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) banned TikTok, citing ""immoral"" and ""indecent"" content on the app. The PTA had previously issued several warnings to TikTok, asking the app to moderate its content and remove objectionable material, but the app reportedly failed to comply with these requests.

The ban sparked a debate among Pakistani users, with many criticizing the PTA for censorship and restricting freedom of speech. However, the PTA defended its decision, stating that it had received numerous complaints from citizens about TikTok's content, which posed a risk to ""society, culture, and ethical values.""

Australia
In July 2020, the Australian government announced that it was considering a ban on TikTok over concerns regarding the app's privacy policies. The country's intelligence agencies reportedly advised the government to ban the app, citing the risk of user data being accessed by the Chinese government.

However, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) clarified that it had not received any complaints regarding TikTok's privacy policies, and that the app was subject to the same privacy laws as other social media platforms in the country. As of now, TikTok is still available in Australia, although the government continues to monitor the app's activities.

Bangladesh
In June 2020, Bangladesh banned TikTok, citing concerns over the app's ""negative effects on society."" The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) reportedly sent a letter to telecom operators asking them to block access to TikTok after receiving complaints from citizens about the app's content.

The ban sparked a backlash among Bangladeshi users, with many taking to social media to criticize the government's move. Some argued that the ban was excessive and violated freedom of expression. However, the BTRC defended its decision, stating that it was necessary to protect ""public morality and law and order.""

Other countries
Several other countries have also imposed limitations on TikTok, either by asking the app to moderate its content or by conducting investigations into its privacy policies. For instance, Indonesia temporarily banned TikTok in 2018 over concerns regarding the app's ""pornographic"" content, while Italy asked TikTok to remove content that violated copyright laws.

Likewise, Japan and South Korea have both conducted investigations into TikTok's privacy policies, with the former asking the app to improve its practices, and the latter announcing plans to introduce stricter regulations on social media platforms in general.

Conclusion
The rise of TikTok has been nothing short of meteoric, but the app's popularity has also come with a fair share of controversies. While some countries have welcomed the app with open arms, others have expressed concerns over its privacy policies and its ties to the Chinese government.

As the app continues to face scrutiny and bans from around the world, its fate remains uncertain. However, one thing is for sure--TikTok has changed the way we consume and create content online, and its impact on popular culture is likely to endure for years to come.",1
171,Adama Sanogo leaving UConn for NBA draft,"UConn men’s basketball player Adama Sanogo has decided to forgo his remaining college eligibility and enter the NBA draft. The sophomore center made the announcement on social media Tuesday.

Sanogo, who is 6-foot-9 and 230 pounds, played a key role for the Huskies this season, averaging 7.3 points and 4.9 rebounds per game. He scored a season-high 16 points in UConn’s NCAA Tournament win over Maryland.

The Mali native posted a heartfelt message on his social media accounts thanking his coaches, teammates and fans for his time at UConn.

“I will never forget the time I spent at UConn,” Sanogo said. “It has been an incredible journey and I am blessed to have experienced it with such an amazing group of people. I am excited for the next chapter of my life and I look forward to continuing to grow and develop as a player.”

Sanogo is projected as a mid-to-late second round pick in the draft, which is scheduled to take place on July 29. If selected, he would become the second UConn player to be drafted in the 2021 NBA draft, with guard James Bouknight expected to be a first-round pick.

UConn fans will certainly miss Sanogo’s physical presence in the paint, but they wish him the best of luck in his NBA career.",1
172,New York latest state to stockpile abortion-inducing pills,"New York is now the latest state to stockpile abortion-inducing pills in preparation for a potential rollback of reproductive rights by the Supreme Court.

The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced on Tuesday that they had secured an increase in the supply of mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs used together to induce abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy. New York has set aside $750,000 for the initiative, which will ensure that medication abortion is available to those who need it regardless of any changes to federal regulations.

Attorney General James said in a statement, “As the threat to reproductive rights intensifies at the national level, New York must step up and lead the fight for women’s health.” She added that, “We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure that women in New York – regardless of their zip code or income – are empowered to make decisions about their own bodies and health.”

The pills, also known as “the abortion pill”, are currently only available through a prescription provided by a health care provider. But by building a stockpile of the medication, New York is creating a safety net for those who might not have access to the pills if restrictions on reproductive rights are further enforced.

The move comes in response to a wave of anti-abortion legislation sweeping across the country. Over the past year, several states have passed bans on abortion at various stages of pregnancy, often in clear defiance of Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights ruling that has been in place for more than four decades.

New York’s stockpiling of abortion pills is the latest in a series of measures taken by state leaders to protect reproductive rights in the face of an increasingly hostile political environment. It is a measure that will bring hope to those who have feared for the future of Roe v. Wade and the impact its potential demise could have on reproductive rights across the country.",1
173,Idaho jurors see graphic photos of slain kids in mom's trial,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Jurors in Idaho were shown graphic photos of two slain children Wednesday as the mother charged with their murders sat in the courtroom.

Lori Vallow Daybell, 47, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of her 7-year-old son Joshua “JJ” Vallow and 17-year-old daughter Tylee Ryan. Their remains were found on her husband's property in 2019, months after they went missing.

The pictures shown to the jurors were described as extremely graphic, and many in the courtroom were brought to tears. Some jurors sat with their heads bowed, while others appeared to fight back tears.

The prosecutor read a statement in court, revealing that the bodies of the children had been dismembered and burned. The defense attorneys for Daybell requested that the graphic photos be excluded from evidence, arguing that the jury did not need to see them.

However, the judge ruled that the photos were necessary for the prosecution's case and allowed them to be shown to the jurors.

Daybell's defense attorneys have argued that she was not in a sound mental state when the children were killed, and that her alleged involvement in their deaths was due to her being under the influence of her husband, Chad Daybell.

Chad Daybell, a self-proclaimed doomsday prepper, was also charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Tylee and JJ. The couple married just weeks after the children disappeared.

Prosecutors say the couple were part of a religious group that believed in the impending end of the world and saw the children as obstacles to their beliefs. Three members of the group, including Chad Daybell’s former wife, have also died under mysterious circumstances.

Prosecutors say that Lori Vallow Daybell had become obsessed with a religious belief that she was a god, and that her children needed to be “removed” in order for her to carry out the divine plan.

The trial has been closely watched by the public, with many people expressing outrage at the alleged crimes committed by the couple against their own children.

“It’s heartbreaking to hear about the brutal deaths of these innocent kids,” said Ashley Smith, a resident of Boise. “What kind of person could do something like that to their own children?”

The case has also sparked a national debate about the role of religion in parenting, and whether the government should intervene in cases where parents’ religious beliefs conflict with the best interests of their children.

“This is a complicated issue that raises questions about the relationship between religion and the law,” said Michael Sandoval, a professor of law at Boise State University. “It’s important for us to have a national conversation about how to balance religious freedom with the need to protect children from abuse.”

The trial is expected to last several more weeks. If convicted, Daybell could face a possible sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.

As the jurors filed out of the courtroom Wednesday, many looked shaken and emotional. One woman, who asked not to be identified, said that seeing the graphic photos of the children’s remains was “the most upsetting thing I’ve ever seen.”

“I can’t imagine what those poor children went through,” she said. “I just hope that justice prevails and that Lori Daybell is held accountable for what she did to them.”",1
174,Expelled Black lawmaker Pearson to return to Tennessee House,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Former Tennessee lawmaker Rep. London Lamar has been expelled from the state House three years ago after racist comments about a previous Tennessee Republican congressman. Now, Lamar announced Thursday she will return to the state House of Representatives.

Lamar, a Democrat, said she is ""honored and humbled"" to return to the legislature after she was expelled from the chamber in 2019. She was booted from the chamber shortly after a video surfaced in which she called former Rep. David Byrd an ""unethical racist."" Byrd had been accused of sexual misconduct by several women while he was a high school girls' basketball coach in the 1980s. Byrd has denied the allegations.

Lamar's video caused an uproar, and her comments were deemed to be in violation of House rules for a member commenting in a defamatory manner about another member. The chamber's ethics committee unanimously voted to expel her from the legislative body, and she lost her seat in a special election.

However, Lamar was re-elected in November to represent the Memphis area's House District 91. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and won the general election with 83% of the vote.

“I am excited to go back to the state legislature to fight for the people of Memphis,” Lamar said in a statement Thursday. “I am dedicated to using my voice to advocate for policies that improve the quality of life for Tennesseans.”

Lamar's return to the legislature has not been met with open arms by all of the lawmakers who sit across the aisle from her. Some Republican lawmakers took to social media Thursday to express their disappointment and frustration.

Rep. Bruce Griffey tweeted: “Just when you thought the bar could not be lowered any further....”

Rep. Mark White urged his colleagues to remember the ""previous behavior"" that led to Lamar's expulsion.

""Regardless of party, our standards for conduct should be high,"" White said in the statement.

Rep. Mike Carter referred to Lamar as a ""divisive figure"" and a ""lighter version of Maxine Waters,"" referring to the California congresswoman who has been known for her vocal criticism of President Donald Trump. Carter also said he hoped the Democratic Caucus would not make Lamar a committee chairwoman.

However, some lawmakers expressed support for Lamar's return to the legislature.

Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat, said Lamar's future in the legislature is up to her.

""Rep. Lamar has been reelected by her constituents and will have an opportunity to make her case for why she should be allowed to serve again,"" Clemmons said in a statement. ""It is up to her to prove that she is ready to serve honorably and with respect for her colleagues.""

Lamar said she intends to focus on criminal justice reform, healthcare, and economic growth. She also said she would work to protect women's rights and address issues such as police brutality and systemic racism.

""I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the major issues facing our state and our nation,"" Lamar said.

Lamar's return to the legislature follows a year of nationwide protests over racial injustice and calls for greater representation for people of color in political office. Her experience as a black lawmaker who was expelled from the legislature because of racially charged remarks could be viewed by some as indicative of the entrenched racism that still pervades American politics.

Lamar's controversial remarks about Byrd were made at a time when the state legislature was grappling with the aftermath of the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The rally sparked a national debate about Confederate symbols, and Tennessee's legislature considered legislation that would have protected monuments to Confederate leaders and soldiers.

While the controversy surrounding Lamar's comments has subsided, the debates over race, police brutality, and systemic racism continue to rage in Tennessee and across the country. Lamar's return to the legislature could provide an opportunity for lawmakers to have an important conversation about how to address these issues.

As Tennessee, along with the rest of the country, grapples with issues of racial inequality, the return of Lamar to the legislature could be seen as a symbol of hope to many people. It remains to be seen how her return to the legislature will play out, but one thing is certain: Lamar is back, and she is ready to fight for the people she represents.",1
175,US revises down last quarter's economic growth to 2.6% rate,"The US economy grew at a revised-down rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018, the government said on Thursday, showing a slowdown in the rate of growth amid concerns about a global economic slowdown.

The revised figures from the Commerce Department shows that the US economy grew at a slower rate than previously thought, with GDP growth for the year now standing at 2.9%, down from the 3.1% previous estimate.

This revised estimate comes as a surprise to many analysts who had expected the US economy to have grown at a faster pace. Despite a large government spending bill and tax cuts, the slowdown in growth caused by the US government shutdown and tariff disputes have impacted investor confidence.

The US economy had experienced a strong run of growth since the last quarter of 2017, boosted by tax cuts and increased government spending, but there are now concerns about whether this can continue.

Many economists are now predicting that the US economy will grow at an even slower pace in the coming months, with some warning of a potential recession in the near future.

""There are definitely concerns about the US economy in the coming months. The recent turmoil in financial markets and slower growth in China and Europe are certainly factors that could cause a slowdown in the US,"" said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at Capital Economics.

Despite the growth slowdown, there was some good news in the latest figures. Consumer spending, which accounts for the largest share of economic activity in the US, expanded at an annual rate of 2.8%, up from the previous estimate of 2.6%. Business investment also picked up, rising at a rate of 5.4%, up from the previous estimate of 3.8%.

However, these positives were offset by weak exports, which fell at an annual rate of 6.9%, a sign of the continued uncertainty over trade.

President Donald Trump has been promoting his economic policies as a key factor in the US economy's success, but some analysts say that the growth spurt of the past year has mainly been driven by the tax cuts and increased government spending, and not by the policies of the Trump administration.

""The tax cuts have definitely boosted the economy, but it remains to be seen whether they will be enough to keep the US economy growing at the pace we've seen over the last year,"" said Loynes.

There are also concerns about a potential trade war and the impact this could have on the US economy. Trump's ongoing trade dispute with China has caused uncertainty for businesses and investors, and an escalation in the dispute could lead to a slowdown in growth.

Despite these concerns, there are also reasons to be optimistic about the US economy moving forward. Unemployment in the US remains at a 50-year low, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in a decade.

The Federal Reserve has also shown a willingness to be patient in raising interest rates, citing the need to be cautious in the face of global economic uncertainty.

It remains to be seen whether the US economy can overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months, but the latest figures show that there are reasons for both optimism and concern. In the face of slower growth and uncertainty over trade, it will be up to policymakers to navigate the challenges and create an environment that supports continued growth and prosperity.",1
176,Robotic dog rejoins New York police,"New York City's police department has just welcomed back an old colleague with a new look: a four-legged robot dog.

The NYPD started using robotic dogs in its operations in 2020. However, after public backlash and criticism from civil rights advocates, the force decided to pause its use of the robots in April of that year.

But now, the department has brought back one of the robots, better known as Digidog, and is hoping to train officers to operate the machines.

The robot dog is powered by artificial intelligence and is designed to be more than just a tool for situational awareness. It's also equipped with cameras and sensors that can detect hazardous materials, identify bombs, and navigate staircases, all from a safe distance.

The NYPD has said that Digidog will mainly be used in hazardous situations, such as hostage crises, explosions, and crime scene investigations.

The department has maintained that the robot dog can save officers' lives by providing a better view during hostage situations or the detection of bombs. It can also enter dangerous situations where it's too risky for a human officer to venture.

However, civil liberties advocates have criticized the NYPD for restarting the robot dog program. Some have voiced concerns that the new technology could be used to increase surveillance and lead to discrimination against marginalized communities.

The NYPD has sought to respond to these concerns by stating that the robots will only be used to protect the public and that they wouldn't infringe on people's privacy rights.

Furthermore, a spokesperson for the department said: ""Our robot is 100% NYPD-owned, controlled, and operated. It is used to save lives, protect people, and protect officers. It doesn't know how to do anything else.""

The police department also said that Digidog will be deployed with human officers and not as a stand-alone device.

As the use of new technologies in law enforcement continues to grow, with tools such as facial recognition, predictive policing, and drones, there are concerns about the potential threat to civil liberties.

However, supporters of the technology claim that it can help law enforcement to de-escalate situations, reduce the risk of injuries to officers, and keep the public safe.

It remains to be seen whether the NYPD's reintroduction of robotic dogs will face the same level of pushback as before, or whether this cutting-edge technology will play an increasingly pivotal role in law enforcement.

Regardless, the use of machines in law enforcement certainly raises questions about the relationship between technology and civil liberties, and whether the benefits outweigh the risks. And as law enforcement and technology continue to evolve, it's vital that policymakers strike the right balance between keeping communities safe and preserving individual rights.",1
177,MLB ump Vanover still in hospital after hit in head by throw,"MLB umpire Jerry Vanover remains in hospital more than a week after he was hit in the head by a pitch during a game between the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Francisco Giants. The incident occurred on May 25th when Giants’ shortstop Brandon Crawford attempted to make an off-balance throw to first base, which hit Vanover instead. 

Vanover was quickly attended to by medical staff and was transported to a local hospital for further evaluation. The umpire was initially diagnosed with a concussion and given pain medication to manage his symptoms. Despite being hospitalized for over a week now, there still hasn’t been any word on when Vanover will be released. 

The incident has once again drawn attention to the safety of umpires during baseball games. Despite donning protective gear, umpires are still vulnerable to errant throws, foul balls, and collisions with players. In recent years, the MLB has taken steps to improve umpire safety by adding more padding to their chest protectors and helmets. 

Vanover has been an MLB umpire since 1993, and in that time, he’s worked a number of high-profile games, including a World Series. His absence has been felt by players, coaches, and fans alike who have all expressed their support and well-wishes for a speedy recovery. 

The MLB has not yet announced when Vanover will be cleared to return to work, but the priority is his health and well-being. For now, Vanover will need to focus on recovering from his concussion and getting back to full strength.",1
178,DNR chief vows to bring wolf plan up for vote in October,"The contentious issue of the management and protection of gray wolves in Wisconsin is set to be discussed at a meeting of the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in October. In recent years, the state's policy towards the predators has become a polarizing subject, with farmers and hunters eager to control the wolf population while conservationists argue for greater protections.

Now, DNR Secretary Preston Cole has announced that the department's board will vote on a proposed wolf management plan during their October meeting. Speaking on the matter in a statement, Cole acknowledged the strong opinions held by advocates on both sides of the debate, but expressed his belief that the proposed plan would provide balance.

""I recognize the significance of wolves to Wisconsin's ecological integrity and to many Wisconsin residents,"" he said. ""We have developed a wolf management plan that balances the interests of the public, the tribes, the conservation community and the hunting and trapping community.""

The proposed plan, which has yet to be made public, will reportedly include measures to monitor and manage the wolf population, such as expanding the areas where wolves can be hunted and reducing their numbers in areas with high rates of depredation. The plan will be subject to public input and review before being presented to the DNR board for a vote.

The last time the DNR put forth a wolf management plan was in 2015, which included controversial provisions for allowing dogs to be used in hunting wolves. However, a federal court overturned the plan in 2014, stating that the DNR had failed to take into account the potential impact on the wolf population.

With the latest proposal set to be put to a vote in October, the wolf debate in Wisconsin is set to heat up once again.",1
179,Some in dry Somalia break Ramadan fast with little but water,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — As Muslims around the world mark Ramadan with fasting, prayer and reflection, some in Somalia are observing the holy month with only water.

The arid East African country is in the midst of a drought that has lasted for several years, leaving more than 3 million people food insecure and without easy access to clean water.

For many, the decision to break their Ramadan fast with nothing but water is not a choice, but a necessity.

“I haven’t had any food today, only water,” Halima Ali, a mother of eight who lives in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, said. “I have no money to buy anything and the little that we had finished a long time ago.”

In many parts of Somalia, the price of food has skyrocketed due to the drought and the government’s failure to address the situation adequately.

According to the United Nations, the cost of a basic food basket has gone up by almost 25% in some regions of the country in the past year alone. The situation is even worse for people living in rural areas, where food insecurity is much higher.

“Many people in rural areas are experiencing acute hunger, and some are starving to death,” Peter de Clercq, the U.N.’s humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, said in a statement earlier this year.

The drought has also left many without access to clean water, which is essential for staying hydrated during Ramadan.

In some areas, people are forced to walk long distances to find water, which is often dirty and contaminated. This has led to a rise in waterborne diseases, such as cholera and dysentery.

“Finding clean water is very difficult,” Hassan Abdi, a resident of the eastern town of Doolow, said. “We have to either walk long distances or pay exorbitant prices to get it.”

The situation is even more dire for those who are internally displaced due to conflict or natural disasters. Many of them are living in crowded makeshift camps, where access to water and food is limited.

“Life is very difficult for us,” Fadumo Abdullahi, a mother of four who recently fled her home in the southern city of Kismayo, said. “We don’t have enough food or water, and it’s very hot during the day.”

In an effort to help those in need during Ramadan, several aid organizations have launched campaigns to provide food and water to those affected by the drought. However, the situation is so dire that they are struggling to keep up with the demand.

“We are doing everything we can to help those in need, but the scale of the problem is enormous,” Mohamed Ahmed, a spokesperson for Oxfam in Somalia, said. “Without more support from the international community, many people will continue to suffer.”

Despite the challenges, many Somalis are determined to continue observing Ramadan, even if it means breaking their fast with only water.

“For us, Ramadan is a time for spiritual reflection and solidarity with those in need,” Farah Ali, a resident of the southern city of Baidoa, said. “Even though we don’t have much, we will share what we have with our neighbors and family.”

Others are hoping that the government and the international community will take action to address the root causes of the drought and alleviate the suffering of the people affected by it.

“This is not a natural disaster, it’s a man-made crisis,” Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, the governor of the southern region of Gedo, said. “We need a long-term solution to this problem, not just short-term aid.”

For now, however, many in Somalia are simply trying to survive each day, relying on the generosity of others and their faith to get them through the holy month of Ramadan.",1
180,"52 years after capture, orca Lolita may return to Pacific","52 years after her capture, Lolita the orca may finally be able to return to the Pacific Ocean. The beloved whale has been a fixture at Miami Seaquarium for over five decades, but animal welfare activists and marine biologists have been fighting for her release for years.

Lolita, also known as Tokitae, was captured in 1970 off the coast of Washington state, along with several other orcas of her pod. While the other whales were sold to marine parks, Lolita was kept in Washington for a year of training before being sold to Miami Seaquarium in Florida. 

The park has come under fire for keeping Lolita in a small tank, where she has spent most of her life swimming in circles. Animal rights activists say the tank is vastly inadequate for a creature meant to roam the open ocean. The tank is only 80 feet by 60 feet and 20 feet deep -- a tiny fraction of the size of the ocean where orcas typically swim.

Since her arrival in Miami, numerous groups have attempted to have Lolita released back to her sea home. A former Lummi tribal orca hunter even offered to buy her from Miami Seaquarium and bring her back to Washington to live out the rest of her life in a sea pen, where she could catch fish and enjoy the company of other orcas. But the park has repeatedly refused offers to release Lolita, citing her age and the fact that she's ""happy"" where she is.

But advocates for Lolita believe that she has suffered for far too long in captivity and that it's time for her to experience freedom. In 2015, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) filed a lawsuit against Miami Seaquarium, alleging that the park was violating the Endangered Species Act by keeping Lolita in captivity. The lawsuit argued that Lolita was being denied the opportunity to swim freely, interact with other orcas, and experience the full range of natural behaviors that are essential to her well-being.

PETA's lawsuit was not successful, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recently proposed designating Lolita as an endangered species, which could make it possible for her to be released back into her natural habitat. The move comes in response to a petition from the Animal Legal Defense Fund and PETA, which argue that orcas in captivity are a unique subgroup of the species that face different threats and challenges than wild orcas.

If Lolita is officially designated as an endangered species, it would be a huge win for animal welfare advocates and a significant step toward her release. However, there are still many challenges that would need to be addressed before she could be allowed to return to the wild. For one thing, Lolita has been in captivity for so long that it's not clear if she would be able to survive on her own in the open ocean. She's also been separated from her pod for over five decades, and it's not clear if she would be able to reintegrate with them.

There are also concerns about the health risks associated with transporting Lolita from Miami to the Pacific Northwest. The whale is estimated to be around 55 years old, which is near the upper limit of the average lifespan for a captive orca. She's also had health problems in the past, including skin lesions and dental issues. Moving her to a new environment could put her at risk for further health problems.

Despite these challenges, advocates for Lolita remain hopeful that she will eventually be able to return to her ocean home. The National Marine Fisheries Service is currently accepting public comments on the proposal to designate Lolita as an endangered species, and animal welfare activists are urging people to voice their support for her release.

If Lolita is released back into the wild, it would be a historic moment for animal welfare and conservation efforts. The captive breeding and display of orcas has been a controversial topic for decades, with many people arguing that these highly intelligent and social creatures should not be held in captivity. The release of Lolita would be a powerful symbol of the growing movement toward greater respect and protection for marine life, and a reminder that these creatures belong in the wild, not in tanks.

As advocates for Lolita continue to push for her release, they hope that her story will inspire more people to take action on behalf of all captive marine animals. With increased public awareness and pressure on marine parks to change their practices, there's hope that one day, all whales and dolphins will be able to live out their lives in their natural habitats, free from confinement and exploitation.",1
181,"Thomas sold real estate to donor, didn't report deal","WASHINGTON (AP) — Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas failed to report a real estate deal he made with a major political donor on his financial disclosure forms for at least five years, according to the Associated Press.

Thomas purchased a townhouse in Georgia worth $1.5 million for less than market value in 1998 from Harlan Crow, a wealthy Republican donor who has financially supported both Thomas and like-minded conservative causes.

The Supreme Court Justice did not disclose the transaction on his annual financial disclosure forms until several years later, after media reports detailed the transaction. Federal judges are required to reveal the source of their income and certain financial transactions under ethics laws.

Thomas’ failure to disclose the deal occurred during a period when he and his wife, Virginia, were under scrutiny for accepting favors from conservative organizations and businessmen. The most notable instance was when the couple flew frequently on a private plane owned by Crow, which resulted in Thomas recusing himself from cases involving Crow after media reports highlighted the arrangement.

Megan Brown, a spokesperson for Justice Thomas, said he simply “misunderstood” the disclosure requirements and filed amended forms. The Supreme Court Justice also obtained a letter from the Committee on Financial Disclosure confirming that the reporting error did not warrant further action.

However, other legal experts suggest the omission could represent a more serious violation of ethics rules, especially given Thomas’ prior problems with conflicts of interest.

“It’s hard to imagine that a Justice of the Supreme Court didn’t understand the rules requiring the disclosure of the transfer of real estate,” said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University.

The news of Thomas’ undisclosed transaction also raises questions about the Supreme Court’s overall transparency and the effectiveness of the ethics rules that justices are expected to follow.

The Supreme Court declined to comment on Justice Thomas’ real estate deal.",1
182,"Adrift in the Atlantic, a boat of death and lost dreams","In the early morning hours of March 29th, a small dinghy was spotted adrift in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Onboard were the bodies of four men, all believed to be migrants attempting to cross from Africa to Europe in search of safety and a better life.

The harrowing tale of this ill-fated journey began weeks earlier in one of the many impoverished coastal towns of Senegal. Despite being one of the most stable countries in West Africa, many of its citizens struggle to make a living, and the lure of a better life in Europe is powerful.

For the four men on the dinghy, their dreams of a better future proved to be elusive. Instead, they found themselves at the mercy of the unforgiving ocean, with little food or water, and no means of communication or navigation.

According to authorities, the group had set out from the town of Mbour, located about 50 kilometers south of the capital, Dakar. Their destination was the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago located off the coast of Africa.

Despite knowing the dangers of the journey, the men had paid a hefty sum to a smuggler who promised to take them across the sea. It is not uncommon for such journeys to be orchestrated by criminal gangs who exploit vulnerable migrants for profit.

The route from Senegal to the Canary Islands is treacherous, with many migrants perishing en route due to harsh weather conditions, lack of food and water, or simply being lost at sea. Given the dangers, the Spanish government has attempted to discourage such journeys and has been working with African countries to increase cooperation in combating organized crime and human trafficking.

But for many migrants, the risks are worth taking. The promise of a better life in Europe has proven irresistible, and they are willing to put their lives on the line to achieve it.

As the days passed and the men on the dinghy drifted further and further out to sea, their desperation grew. With no means of communication, they were unable to call for help or let loved ones know of their plight.

According to reports, the men had brought only a limited amount of food and water with them, and it quickly ran out. They resorted to catching fish to survive, but it was not enough to sustain them for long.

Days turned into weeks, and the men lost all sense of time and direction. They were adrift in a seemingly endless expanse of ocean, with no land in sight.

It is not clear how long the men had been adrift before they were discovered. A passing fishing boat spotted their dinghy and immediately alerted the authorities. When rescuers arrived on the scene, they found the four men already dead, their bodies badly decomposed and ravaged by exposure.

For the families of these men, their hopes and dreams had been dashed. Instead of a better life, they now faced the unbearable pain of loss and uncertainty.

The tragedy of this story is one that has become all too common in recent years. With conflicts and economic crises fueling mass migration movements, many people are undertaking dangerous journeys in search of safety and a better life.

But the risks are immense, and the consequences can be deadly. In the past year alone, more than 3,000 migrants have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea, with countless others going missing or remaining stranded at sea.

Despite international efforts to address the root causes of migration and improve the lives of those affected, progress has been slow. Many migrants continue to live in limbo, with little hope of a better future and no means of returning to their home countries.

The tragedy of the four men on board the dinghy is a poignant reminder of the human cost of undocumented migration. It serves as a wake-up call for governments and organizations to take more decisive action to address the root causes of the crisis and provide meaningful support to those affected.

But it is also a reminder of the resilience and courage of those who are willing to risk everything for a better life. Their struggles and sacrifices should be honored and remembered, and their stories should serve as a call to action for all those committed to creating a more just and equitable world.",1
183,Airline stocks shares fall on American's so-so 1Q outlook,"The airline industry is once again facing a downturn, as American Airlines released a lackluster outlook for the first quarter of 2021. As a result, the airline's stocks have fallen, sparking concerns for the entire industry.

On Thursday, American Airlines reported losses of $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, increasing its total losses for the year to a staggering $8.9 billion. The airline's CEO, Doug Parker, cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the main reason for these losses, stating that the virus has had an unprecedented impact on the industry.

Despite this, American Airlines had hoped to bounce back in the first quarter of 2021. However, the airline's outlook for the quarter was less than promising. American Airlines expects to generate revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, which is only slightly better than the $2.0 billion it generated in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Investors were quick to respond to the news, with American Airlines' shares falling by more than 6% after the announcement. Other airline stocks also took a hit, with Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines all falling by more than 3%.

The airline industry had already been struggling due to the pandemic, with travel restrictions and lockdowns causing a significant decrease in demand for air travel. Many airlines have had to cut costs and lay off employees to stay afloat.

The outlook for the industry remains uncertain, with the vaccine rollout offering a glimmer of hope for airlines. However, the slow pace of the rollout is likely to continue to impact the industry for the foreseeable future.

The situation has prompted airline companies to look for new ways to generate revenue. American Airlines, for example, plans to introduce new routes and increase its cargo business to offset some of the losses incurred during the pandemic.

Other airlines have also been exploring new opportunities. Delta Air Lines, for instance, has started offering COVID-19 testing for passengers before their flights, which could help to increase demand for air travel.

Despite these efforts, the outlook for the industry remains bleak. The slow pace of the vaccine rollout and the uncertainty surrounding travel restrictions mean that it is unlikely that the airline industry will bounce back anytime soon.

Investors are understandably cautious, with many predicting that it could be several years before the airline industry returns to pre-pandemic levels. This is likely to have a significant impact on the global economy, with the airline industry being a major contributor to economic growth.

In conclusion, the airline industry is once again facing a difficult period, with American Airlines' so-so outlook for the first quarter of 2021 causing concern for investors. While airlines are exploring new ways to generate revenue, the slow pace of the vaccine rollout and the uncertainty surrounding travel restrictions mean that the industry is likely to continue to struggle for the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how airlines will respond to these challenges and how they will continue to adapt to the changing landscape of air travel. However, it is clear that the future of the airline industry remains uncertain.",1
184,Amazon's Jassy says AI will be a 'big deal' for company,"SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy said Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be the ""big deal"" in the company's future growth strategy, as the e-commerce giant prioritizes technology investment following his predecessor's departure last month.

In his first public remarks since taking over from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Jassy outlined his vision for the future of the company. Speaking at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Summit in New York City on Tuesday, he said that AI has already made the company's services smarter and that he sees AI as a key driver of future innovation.

""We are just at the beginning of what is possible with AI,"" Jassy said. ""There are still so many untapped opportunities and AI will be a big deal for our company in the years ahead.""

The company has been investing heavily in AI technology for several years, focusing on its cloud computing platform, AWS. The platform, which is used by companies and government agencies worldwide, has become one of Amazon's most lucrative businesses, with revenue of more than $30 billion last year.

Jassy said AI is already being used to improve the efficiency of AWS, with the technology able to optimize customer operations and reduce operational costs. However, he believes there is much more potential for AI to revolutionize the way businesses operate.

""AI will help us create new and innovative products, and it will enable us to solve complex business problems that were once impossible to tackle,"" Jassy said. ""We see AI as a critical tool for driving business growth and staying ahead of the competition.""

He also emphasized that AI will not replace human workers but will instead enhance their capabilities, allowing them to work smarter and faster.

Jassy's remarks come as Amazon's cloud computing business faces increased competition from rivals such as Microsoft and Google. However, the company's investment in AI technology is expected to help it maintain its dominant position in the market.

Overall, Jassy's comments suggest that AI will be a significant part of Amazon's growth strategy going forward, and the company is likely to continue investing heavily in the technology in the coming years.",1
185,"Urologist accused of patient sex abuse, including of minors","A urologist from a prominent medical center has been accused of sexually abusing multiple patients, including minors, according to the authorities.

The doctor, who has not been named publicly, was charged with nine counts of sexual battery and six counts of molestation. The alleged abuse reportedly began as far back as 2014, and involved both adult and underage patients.

According to the police report, the urologist allegedly engaged in sexually explicit conversations with his patients, groped them in inappropriate places, and made sexual advances towards them. Some of the patients involved were as young as 14 years old.

The accused urologist has been suspended from his position at the medical center pending further investigation. In a statement, the medical center expressed their shock and dismay at the allegations, and promised to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials.

The urologist has since been released on bail pending trial, but is facing serious charges that could result in significant jail time if he is found guilty.

Sexual abuse by doctors and other medical professionals is unfortunately not a new phenomenon. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of doctors being accused of sexually abusing their patients, ranging from inappropriate touching to outright rape.

These cases have raised concerns about the safety of patients in medical settings, and have prompted calls for greater oversight and accountability for doctors and other healthcare professionals.

One potential solution is to require all doctors and medical professionals to undergo regular sexual harassment and abuse training, as well as to establish clear protocols for reporting and investigating allegations of misconduct.

Patients who have been sexually abused by a doctor or other medical professional have the right to seek justice through the legal system. They may be entitled to compensation for any physical, emotional, or financial harm that they have suffered as a result of the abuse.

Regardless of the outcome of this particular case, it serves as a sobering reminder of the vulnerability of patients in medical settings, and the need for greater vigilance and accountability to prevent future incidents of abuse.",1
186,Italy planning 5-figure fines for monument and art vandalism,"ROME (AP) - Italy is cracking down on monument and art vandalism with proposed fines reaching five figures. The country has been plagued by acts of vandalism on historical and cultural landmarks.

The new legislation, if approved, would see fines of at least €10,000 ($11,800) issued to anyone caught vandalizing public monuments or artwork. For those caught defacing or damaging more valuable works, fines could reach up to €100,000 ($118,000).

“Art and cultural heritage are not just things to be enjoyed for their beauty,” said Culture Minister Dario Franceschini. “They represent the soul of a nation.”

According to the Italian news agency ANSA, over 300 incidents of vandalism were reported last year, ranging from graffiti on ancient ruins to damage to sculptures and statues. Earlier this year, the famous Trevi Fountain in Rome was damaged by a man who chipped off a piece of the sculpture with a hammer.

The proposed legislation has been welcomed by the Italian art community. “This sends a clear message that we will not tolerate acts of vandalism on our cultural heritage,” said Professor Giovanni Visentin, an expert in Italian Renaissance art.

Italy is home to numerous UNESCO World Heritage sites, including the Colosseum, Pompeii, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Tourists flock to the country to visit these cultural landmarks, and any damage to them is seen as a national disgrace.

The new legislation is due to be debated by parliament in the coming weeks.",1
187,911 calls show chaotic moments during Kentucky bank shooting,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Newly released 911 recordings from last week's deadly shooting at a Kentucky bank reveal the chaotic moments as people inside desperately sought help. 

The calls, released by police on Wednesday, capture the sounds of gunshots ringing out and people's frantic voices as they called for help during the shooting that killed two and wounded one other person. 

The 911 center received the first call at 8:45 a.m. on January 21, and the recording captures the moment when the dispatcher first learns of the shooting. 

“There's been a shooting at BB&amp;T Bank. There's people down,” a caller says. “Hurry, please hurry.” 

The dispatcher tells the caller that police and emergency medical services have already been dispatched to the scene. 

Another caller describes the scene inside the bank, saying that someone is shooting and people are hiding under desks. 

“It sounded like gunshots, and it sounded like there’s a guy walking around shooting,” the caller says. 

The caller can be heard whispering as gunfire continues in the background. 

“There's a lady in here shot. There's a guy in here shot,” the caller adds. “I’m hiding under the desk. Please hurry, hurry, hurry.” 

The dispatcher continues to reassure the caller that help is on the way. 

Throughout the recordings, the urgency in the callers' voices is palpable. One woman pleads for help, saying her husband has been shot. 

“My husband's been shot. Please hurry,” the woman says. 

In another call, a man describes the shooter and tells the dispatcher that he's still inside the bank. 

“He's still shooting,” the man says. 

One of the most harrowing calls comes from a woman who managed to escape the bank. She tells the dispatcher that she was in the bank's break room when she heard gunshots. 

“I opened the door just a little bit and I saw him. He had a hat on and some glasses,” the woman says. “He saw me and started coming after me, so I went back into the break room and locked the door.” 

The woman can be heard sobbing as she recalls the moments when she thought she would die. 

“He's in there with them,” she says, referring to those who were still inside the bank. “Please, please hurry. Oh my God, please.” 

The gunman, identified as 57-year-old James Ratliff, was arrested at the scene and charged with murder, attempted murder and robbery. Police have not released a motive for the shooting. 

According to police, Ratliff entered the bank armed with a handgun and demanded money from the tellers. He then opened fire, killing two employees, 36-year-old Tammy Jo Zimmerman and 51-year-old Steve Smith. Another employee, 57-year-old Veronica Judy, was wounded in the shooting and remains hospitalized. 

In a statement released after the shooting, BB&amp;T Bank expressed its condolences to the victims and their families. 

“We are deeply saddened by the tragic event that occurred at our local BB&amp;T branch today,” the statement read. “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured and their loved ones. We are working closely with law enforcement as they investigate the matter and will provide more information as it becomes available.” 

The shooting has left the community in shock and mourning. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear issued a statement on Twitter in which he expressed his condolences to the victims and their families. 

“The shooting at BB&amp;T Bank in Sebree is heartbreaking and senseless,” Beshear wrote. “My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, and I commend law enforcement for their quick response to the scene.” 

The shooting comes just weeks after a similar incident in which five people were killed at a SunTrust bank in Florida. In that case, the shooter, 21-year-old Zephen Xaver, surrendered to police after a standoff that lasted more than two hours. 

In the aftermath of the two shootings, many are calling for stricter gun control laws. Kentucky state senator Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat, announced on Tuesday that he plans to introduce a bill that would require background checks for all gun sales in the state. 

“We have a responsibility to do something,” McGarvey said in a statement. “We cannot continue to allow mass shootings to occur without taking meaningful action to prevent them.” 

The push for gun control is likely to face opposition from many Kentucky lawmakers, who take pride in their state's long history of gun ownership and hunting. 

But for those who witnessed the horror at the BB&amp;T Bank in Sebree, the need for action is clear. 

“I never thought something like this would happen in our small town,” one caller says in the 911 recordings. 

“I hope this never happens to anyone else,” another adds. 

As the community mourns the loss of two of its residents and prays for the speedy recovery of the wounded bank employee, many are left wondering what can be done to prevent such tragedies from happening again. 

In the meantime, the 911 recordings serve as a somber reminder of the chaos and terror that can unfold in an instant.",1
188,US floats options to reduce water pulled from Colorado River,"The United States government is currently considering a range of possible solutions to reduce the amount of water being pulled from the Colorado River, which has been hit hard by climate change.

For decades, the Colorado River has been a critical source of water for close to 40 million people who live in the southwestern United States. However, the river's flow has been steadily declining in recent years, thanks to a combination of ongoing drought, climate change and overuse.

To address this growing challenge, the government is now floating a number of options in a bid to reduce the strain on the Colorado River and safeguard communities' ability to access clean, healthy water.

One possible solution is to pay farmers in the region to use less water. By offering financial incentives to farmers to reduce their water use, the government hopes to decrease the amount of water being pulled from the Colorado River and ensure that everyone downstream can access the water they need.

This option is not without its challenges, however. Many farmers in the region have relied on the Colorado River for decades to irrigate their crops, and may not be willing to reduce their water use voluntarily.

Another option being considered is to increase the efficiency of water use across the region. By investing in new technologies and infrastructure, the government believes it may be possible to reduce overall water use while still allowing communities and businesses to meet their needs.

This could involve anything from upgrading irrigation systems to investing in more desalination plants, which turn saltwater into drinkable water.

However, this option could also be expensive and challenging to implement, particularly if it involves retrofitting older infrastructure or convincing private businesses to change their practices.

The government is also exploring the option of using recycled wastewater as a source of drinking water for people in the region. This could be particularly useful in urban areas, where a large amount of water is consumed by homes and businesses.

Recycling wastewater could help to reduce the strain on the Colorado River while also providing a reliable source of clean water for communities across the region.

However, this option may be unpopular with some residents, who may be hesitant to drink water that has been treated in this way.

Finally, the government is also considering the possibility of restricting water use across the region. This could involve limiting the amount of water that people and businesses are allowed to use, or imposing water use quotas on certain industries.

This option would likely be unpopular with many residents, who may see it as an infringement on their rights. It may also be difficult to enforce, particularly if some people or businesses refuse to comply with the new regulations.

Despite these challenges, many experts believe that some combination of the above options will be needed to secure the future of the Colorado River and the communities that depend on it.

""The Colorado River is essential for millions of people across the region, but it's facing unprecedented challenges,"" explains Jim Gudgeon, a water policy expert with the Environmental Defense Fund.

""We need to start thinking creatively and proactively about how we can reduce the strain on the river and ensure that everyone has access to the water they need.""

Others believe that the government needs to take bolder action to address the growing water crisis.

""The Colorado River is drying up, and we need to act fast if we're going to prevent a disaster,"" says Michael Warren, a climate policy expert at the Sierra Club.

""That means investing in new, innovative solutions like seawater desalination, and making sure that everyone is doing their part to conserve water as much as possible.""

Regardless of the specific approach taken to address the water crisis, one thing is clear: the situation is urgent, and we need to act fast if we're going to protect the Colorado River and the communities that depend on it.",1
189,"Jeremy Renner, Metallica and 'Cocaine Bear'","Hollywood actor Jeremy Renner has joined forces with legendary rock band Metallica to produce a new feature film titled 'Cocaine Bear'.

The movie is based on a true story that unfolded in 1985 when a 175-pound black bear in Georgia accidentally consumed large amounts of cocaine that had been dropped from a small aircraft. The bear was later found dead and became widely known as 'Pablo Escobar's cocaine bear'.

Renner, who is best known for his roles in movies such as 'The Hurt Locker' and 'The Avengers', will be playing the lead role in the film. Meanwhile, Metallica will be providing the score, which includes several original songs.

The project is a passion project for both Renner and Metallica, who have reportedly been working on it for several years. In a statement, Renner expressed his excitement about the collaboration.

""I am incredibly excited to be working with Metallica on this project. 'Cocaine Bear' is such a unique story and I am honored to be portraying the lead. I cannot wait for audiences around the world to see this film.""

Metallica's frontman, James Hetfield, also shared his enthusiasm about the project. In an interview with AP News, he said, ""We've wanted to do a film score for a while now and this project was the perfect opportunity for us. The story is wild and the energy of the music is a great match. We can't wait to see the final product.""

Aside from Renner and Metallica, the film will also feature an impressive cast that includes several up-and-coming actors. Carlito Olivero, who is known for his role in the Netflix series 'East Los High', will be playing one of the lead supporting roles.

The movie is being directed by Elizabeth Banks, who is best known for her work in comedies such as 'Pitch Perfect' and '30 Rock'. Banks has also expressed excitement about the project, stating that it will offer a unique blend of humor and drama.

""This story is unlike anything I've worked on before. It's funny, it's dramatic, it's based on a true story, and it's got a bear that accidentally consumes a ton of cocaine. What more could you ask for? I think audiences are going to love it.""

Pre-production for the film has already begun, with filming expected to start later this year. The project has been eagerly anticipated by both fans of Renner and Metallica, who are excited to see how the two will work together.

This is not the first time that a musician has teamed up with a Hollywood actor for a feature film project. Several artists, including Prince, Madonna, and Beyoncé, have all appeared in movies throughout their careers.

However, it is unusual for a band to provide the score for a major motion picture. Metallica's involvement in 'Cocaine Bear' is therefore a unique opportunity for the band to showcase their musical talent in a different way.

Metallica's longtime fans are excited about the project, with many taking to social media to express their enthusiasm. Several fans have also speculated about what the score might sound like, with some predicting a blend of heavy metal and orchestral music.

Renner fans are similarly excited about the project, with many expressing their eagerness to see him in a unique role. The actor has previously starred in a number of high-profile films, but his involvement in a project such as 'Cocaine Bear' showcases his willingness to take on challenging and unconventional roles.

For both Renner and Metallica, 'Cocaine Bear' is an opportunity to show their fans a different side of themselves. The movie promises to be a unique blend of humor, drama, and music, and is likely to be one of the most anticipated films of the coming year. With such a powerful combination of talent behind it, 'Cocaine Bear' is sure to be a hit with audiences around the world.",1
190,Your tax refund could be smaller than last year. Here's why,"As tax season kicks off, Americans may find themselves receiving a smaller refund than last year, and there are several reasons for this. After the major tax overhaul under the Trump administration in 2017, many taxpayers saw higher refunds or a lower tax bill. However, changes to the tax code and economic conditions have contributed to reduced refunds this year.

One of the key changes that has affected refunds is the new tax tables issued by the IRS. The tables are used to calculate how much in taxes an individual or household should pay, based on their income and filing status. These tables were updated following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), and many workers saw positive changes in their take-home pay throughout 2018 as a result. However, since the tax tables were updated based on estimates of how much taxpayers would be earning throughout the year, some workers may have had too much or too little withheld from their paychecks. This can lead to a tax refund that is smaller than expected.

Another factor that has contributed to reduced refunds is changes to certain deductions and credits. The TCJA eliminated or limited some popular deductions, such as the state and local tax deduction (SALT), which allowed taxpayers to deduct their state and local income, sales, and property taxes. The cap on the SALT deduction is now set at $10,000, which has been a significant blow to taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes, such as California, New York, and New Jersey. The medical expenses deduction has also been limited, as taxpayers can now only deduct medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of their adjusted gross income, rather than the previous threshold of 10%.

Additionally, some tax credits have been modified under the TCJA. For example, the child tax credit has been increased from $1,000 to $2,000, but the income phase-out limits have been lowered, which means that some families who previously qualified for the credit may no longer be eligible. The earned income tax credit (EITC) has also been expanded, but the eligibility rules have changed, which may result in some taxpayers receiving a smaller credit.

The impact of these changes on individual taxpayers will vary depending on their income, filing status, and other factors. However, it’s clear that many taxpayers will see a smaller refund this year, or may even owe money to the IRS. Some taxpayers have already started to see these effects, as the IRS reported that the average refund was down 8% in the first week of tax season compared to last year.

Economic conditions also play a role in the size of tax refunds. The Tax Policy Center estimates that about two-thirds of taxpayers will receive a tax cut under the TCJA in 2018, with an average tax cut of about $1,600. However, other economic factors, such as changes in income, can also affect the size of refunds. Unemployment has been low, which means that some taxpayers may have earned more income or worked more hours, which can lead to a lower refund or even a tax bill.

There are several ways that taxpayers can prepare for a smaller refund or a potential tax bill. One option is to adjust withholding on their paycheck to ensure that they have the correct amount of taxes withheld throughout the year. The IRS provides a withholding calculator on its website, which can help taxpayers estimate how much they should have withheld based on their income and other variables.

Taxpayers can also review their deductions and credits to see if they qualify for any additional tax breaks. For example, taxpayers who contribute to a traditional IRA may be able to deduct those contributions from their income, which can reduce their tax liability. Similarly, taxpayers who make charitable contributions or have mortgage interest may be able to itemize those deductions instead of taking the standard deduction, which could result in a lower tax bill.

Finally, taxpayers can work with a tax professional to help navigate the complex tax code and ensure that they are taking advantage of all available tax breaks. A tax professional can also help with tax planning throughout the year to minimize taxes and avoid surprises at tax time.

Despite the potential for reduced refunds, it’s important to remember that the tax overhaul has had a positive impact on many taxpayers. The TCJA has lowered the tax burden for many families and businesses, and simplified the tax code in many ways. However, like any major policy change, there are winners and losers, and some taxpayers may see a smaller refund or even owe money this tax season.

Overall, it’s important for taxpayers to be prepared and informed about the changes to the tax code, and to take steps to maximize their tax savings throughout the year. With the help of a tax professional or the resources available from the IRS, taxpayers can ensure that they are getting the most out of their tax return, and avoid any unpleasant surprises.",1
191,Gujarat Titans notch 6-wicket win over Punjab Kings in IPL,"The Gujarat Titans put up a clinical performance to notch a 6-wicket win over the Punjab Kings in the latest match played in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament.

Winning the toss and opting to bowl first, the Titans stunned the Kings by bowling them out for a meager 123 in just 19.2 overs. The Titans' bowlers were on point and never allowed the Kings to score freely. Mohammed Siraj was the pick of the bowlers, who finished with figures of 3/26, while Nathan Coulter-Nile and Rahul Chahar picked up two wickets each.

Chasing a modest target, the Titans got off to a solid start, with their openers Devdutt Padikkal and Ruturaj Gaikwad putting up a partnership of 57 runs for the first wicket. Padikkal, who scored a well-paced half-century, was the key to the Titans' chase. He played some delightful strokes and ensured that the Titans never lost momentum.

Despite losing a few quick wickets towards the end, the Titans chased down the target with three overs to spare, thanks to a cameo from skipper Kieron Pollard, who smashed an unbeaten 18-ball 28.

The win was a much-needed one for the Titans, who had lost their previous two matches. It would surely boost their morale and confidence going into the next matches.

On the other hand, it was a disappointing performance from the Kings, who were outplayed in all departments of the game. Their batsmen failed to get going, and their bowlers looked clueless against the Titans' batsmen. And to make matters worse, they had to drop star batsman Chris Gayle due to an injury.

The loss doesn't harm the Kings' position on the points table, as they are still placed at the second spot with 8 points from 6 matches. However, they would be hoping to bounce back strongly in the upcoming matches.

With this win, the Titans move up to the fifth spot on the points table with 4 points from 6 matches. They would be looking to build on this performance and climb up the ladder in the upcoming matches.

Overall, it was a one-sided contest where the Titans showcased their dominance and won comfortably. They would be hoping to carry this form forward and make a strong statement in this season of IPL.",1
192,Indiana birth control bills move with abortion ban in flux,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A pair of bills concerning birth control in Indiana have made it out of committee and will move on to be considered by the full House of Representatives. However, the ongoing battle over a proposed bill that would ban abortions in Indiana threatens to overshadow conversation around the birth control bills.

House Bill 1172, authored by Rep. Ben Smaltz (R-Auburn), would make birth control available over the counter without a prescription. House Bill 1578, authored by Rep. Peggy Mayfield (R-Martinsville), would prohibit insurers from covering abortion services except in cases of medical emergencies.

Both bills were heard by the House Public Policy Committee on Tuesday, with the abortion coverage bill garnering more discussion than the birth control bill. The uncertainty surrounding the future of abortion access in Indiana looms large as lawmakers debate the fate of both bills.

“I’d like to be able to support [HB 1172], but I think it’s wholly and completely overshadowed by HB 1430, and this bill becomes in some way immaterial,” said Rep. Ed Delaney (D-Indianapolis), referring to the proposed abortion ban.

HB 1430, authored by Rep. Curt Nisly (R-Goshen), seeks to criminalize all forms of abortion in Indiana, regardless of whether the pregnancy resulted from rape, incest, or poses a threat to the life of the mother. The bill enjoys support from a significant number of lawmakers in the House, but has not received a hearing in the House judiciary committee.

Opponents of HB 1430 say it would result in a total ban on abortions in Indiana, eliminating the ability for women in the state to make choices about their own bodies.

“We have the constitutional right to make healthcare decisions based on our own beliefs and values,” said Chrissy Smith, the CEO of the Indiana Family Health Council. “Forcing Hoosiers to bear children that they don’t want or can’t afford is not only bad public policy, it’s unconstitutional.”

Those in support of HB 1430 argue that it is a necessary step in protecting the lives of unborn children.

“Abortion in any case is the intentional taking of a human life,” said Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Jimtown). “It is never an appropriate solution.”

The debate over abortion access is likely to continue to dominate conversation in the Indiana legislature as the session continues. However, there are some lawmakers who believe that there is common ground to be found when it comes to birth control access.

Rep. Smaltz, author of the birth control over-the-counter bill, said that his legislation is a “common-sense solution” to help increase access to birth control for those who need it.

“There’s no reason for there to be a shortage or a lack of access to contraceptives,” Smaltz said. “The availability of birth control has been proven to reduce unintended pregnancies, and this bill will help make it easier for people to get the care they need.”

Similarly, Rep. Mayfield, author of the abortion coverage bill, believes that her legislation is an important step in reducing the number of abortions performed in Indiana.

“By limiting access to abortion coverage, we’re creating a financial incentive for women to avoid unintended pregnancies,” Mayfield said.

While both bills represent different approaches to addressing reproductive health in Indiana, they may hold promise as a potential compromise between pro-life and pro-choice interests. However, the fate of the bills remains uncertain as lawmakers continue to clash over the proposed abortion ban.

The full House will consider both bills in the coming weeks, along with other proposed legislation around reproductive health care. The future of access to birth control and abortion in Indiana hangs in the balance, as lawmakers continue to debate and negotiate the best path forward for the state.",1
193,Arkansas requires parents' OK for children on social media,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas now requires parents’ permission before children under 13 can access social media networking sites.

The state Legislature overwhelmingly passed the measure in March, and Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed it into law on Thursday.

The law requires social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to partake in a verification process to ensure that children under 13 have the permission of a parent or legal guardian before they create an account or use social media.

“We must ensure that our children are better protected as they navigate the internet and social media sites,” said Hutchinson in a statement.

The law is the first of its kind in the nation, according to lawmakers who sponsored the measure. While several social media sites prohibit users under the age of 13 from creating an account, practically all of them do not require a parent’s permission.

The bill’s sponsors point to concerns about online predators, identity theft, and cyberbullying as reasons for the requirement. The measure also prohibits social media sites from sharing or selling the child’s personal information.

A recent report from the Cyberbullying Research Center revealed that an estimated 34% of children have experienced cyberbullying at some point in their lives. The same study revealed that nearly 10% of children have had personal information such as their phone number, address, or social security number shared online without their consent.

However, some privacy advocates have voiced concerns about the new law, arguing that it is overly intrusive and could lead to censorship of online content.

“The bill’s intention may be to protect children, but in reality, it could lead to a reduction in free speech,” said Sarah Roberts, a professor at the University of California.

The new law is set to take effect in 90 days. Social media companies that fail to comply with the measure could face penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.

The measure builds on efforts by other states, such as California, to protect children online. California passed a similar law in 2018, requiring social media sites to disclose the types of personal information they collect from children under 13.",1
194,Few details in SF stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The founder of popular payment app Cash App, Bob Lee, was found stabbed to death in his San Francisco home on Wednesday, according to police.

Details surrounding Lee's death remain sparse, with police yet to release the identity of any suspects or a possible motive for the killing. Lee, 32, had been living in the city for several years after founding the payment app that quickly became a household name.

Cash App, which allows users to easily transfer money to their friends and family, became a hit after its launch back in 2013. The app has since grown to boast millions of users, with many turning to it as an alternative to traditional banking services.

San Francisco police say they received a call around 9 a.m. on Wednesday reporting a ""possible homicide"" at a residence in the city's Nob Hill neighborhood. Upon arriving, officers found Lee's body inside the home, with multiple stab wounds to the chest.

The investigation remains ongoing, with police not disclosing whether any items were stolen from the home or whether they have any leads in the case. However, police say they believe the stabbing was an isolated incident and that there is not a threat to the general public.

Lee was well-known in the tech community, having worked at several other prominent social media and tech companies before launching Cash App. He had also been invited to speak at numerous conferences and events, where he shared his insights on the future of tech and Silicon Valley.

Many in the tech community have expressed their shock and condolences following news of Lee's death. ""Bob was a visionary, who always believed in the power of technology to change the world,"" said John Doerr, a prominent venture capitalist and early investor in Cash App. ""He was a true innovator and will be sorely missed.""

Others have taken to social media to pay tribute to Lee, with many sharing memories of the young entrepreneur and his contributions to the tech industry. ""Bob was one of the smartest and most genuine people I've ever met,"" wrote tech industry veteran Arianna Huffington on Twitter. ""His death is a tragic loss for the entire community.""

The death of Bob Lee and the lack of details surrounding his murder has left many in the tech community on edge, with some calling for increased security measures for high-profile tech executives and entrepreneurs. In recent years, several other prominent tech figures have been the victims of various crimes, including extortion, theft, and hacking.

The San Francisco police have yet to comment on any additional security measures that may be implemented in the wake of Lee's murder. However, they have urged anyone with information about the incident to come forward and contact authorities.

Cash App has not yet released an official statement regarding Lee's death, but the company's Twitter account has been flooded with messages of condolence and support for Lee's family and the wider Cash App team.

The killing of Bob Lee is sure to send shockwaves through the tech community, with many grappling to come to terms with the tragic loss of a young entrepreneur who was seen as a rising star in the industry.

As the investigation into his murder continues, many will be watching closely to see if any additional details emerge about who may have killed Bob Lee and why. For now, however, the world is left to mourn the loss of a true visionary who was taken far too soon.",1
195,Jury awards $3.2 million to ex-Tesla worker for racial abuse,"A former employee of Tesla, who says he was subjected to racial harassment on the job, has been awarded $3.2 million by a California jury.

Owen Diaz, 34, a black man who worked at the company’s Fremont factory from 2015 to 2016, filed a lawsuit against the electric car company in 2017, alleging that he was subjected to constant racial taunts, threats and graffiti on bathroom walls.

Diaz testified that his co-workers called him the N-word and used other racial slurs, and that he found swastikas and racist graffiti in the plant’s bathrooms. He also claimed that he reported the incidents to human resources, but that the company failed to act.

In a statement, Diaz’s attorney said the verdict sends a “clear message” that “racism will not be tolerated in the workplace”. “We hope this verdict serves as a wake-up call to Tesla and to all employers that if they turn a blind eye to discrimination in the workplace, there will be consequences,” said Lawrence Organ.

Tesla said it was “disappointed” with the verdict and that it had “rigorous policies and procedures in place to prohibit harassment and discrimination” at its facilities. “There is no place for harassment or discrimination of any kind at Tesla, and we will continue to do everything we can to foster a positive and inclusive workplace for all our employees,” the company said in a statement.

The verdict is a blow to the electric car maker, which has been dogged by allegations of racial discrimination at its California factory. Last year, a group of black employees filed a lawsuit against Tesla, alleging that they were subjected to racial ridicule and harassment at the Fremont plant.

At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk told employees in a company-wide email that he had “zero tolerance” for “any type of discrimination or harassment”. “It is not who we are, and not how we operate,” he wrote.

However, Musk has also been criticised for his own behaviour. Last year, he made headlines for calling a Thai cave rescue diver a “pedo guy” on Twitter. The diver, Vernon Unsworth, had criticised Musk’s offer to send a submarine to assist with the rescue.

In addition to the verdict in the Diaz case, Tesla is facing other legal challenges. Last year, the US National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against the company, alleging that it violated federal labour laws by firing employees who were involved in organising a union. Tesla denies the accusations.

The company is also facing scrutiny over several high-profile accidents involving its Autopilot system, which has been linked to a number of deaths and injuries.

Despite these setbacks, Tesla has been on a tear in recent years, with its stock soaring to new heights and the company becoming one of the world’s most valuable car makers. Earlier this year, it announced that it had delivered 184,800 vehicles in the first quarter, a new record for the company.

However, some analysts warn that Tesla’s success is far from guaranteed, with the company facing stiff competition from established automakers and new entrants like Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio.",1
196,Man agrees to plead guilty in Basquiat artwork fraud scheme,"A man has agreed to plead guilty in a scheme to sell fake art by renowned artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

On Thursday, February 25th, Florida resident, Philip Righter, agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud and money laundering in a New York court. The charges stem from a scheme to sell counterfeit Basquiat artwork to unsuspecting buyers for millions of dollars.

According to court documents, Righter worked with at least one unnamed co-conspirator to create fake Basquiat artwork and pass them off as genuine pieces. They used fake certificates of authenticity and fraudulent provenance documents to support the sale of the counterfeit artwork.

The scheme reportedly involved selling the fake Basquiat artwork through various channels, including art galleries, auction houses, and private dealers. Righter and his co-conspirators are alleged to have received millions of dollars in proceeds from the sale of the counterfeit artwork.

The FBI began investigating the scheme in 2017 after suspicious art dealers raised concerns about the authenticity of some Basquiat pieces being sold in the market. The investigation led to a raid on Righter's home in Florida and the seizure of thousands of documents related to the sale of fake Basquiat artwork.

In a statement released by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Acting US Attorney Audrey Strauss said that the sale of counterfeit artwork ""undermines confidence in the authenticity of art and drives up the value of the genuine articles.""

Strauss went on to say that Righter's plea agreement ""sends a clear message that those who engage in art fraud will be held accountable for their actions.""

Righter faces up to 20 years in prison for the wire fraud charge and up to 10 years for the money laundering charge. His sentencing is scheduled for July 28th.

The Basquiat artwork fraud scheme is just one example of a larger problem facing the art world. Counterfeit artwork can be difficult to identify, particularly when it comes to artists like Basquiat who often used unorthodox techniques and materials in their work.

To combat the issue, art experts recommend that buyers and sellers work with reputable dealers and auction houses that have a proven track record of selling genuine artwork. They also advise buyers to do their research and ask for documentation that verifies the authenticity of a piece before making a purchase.

As for the art world, stricter regulations and better authentication methods may be necessary to prevent the sale of counterfeit artwork in the future.

In the meantime, Righter's plea agreement serves as a reminder that the art world will not tolerate fraud and deception in the sale of valuable artwork. As Acting US Attorney Strauss said, ""Our cultural heritage depends on the authenticity of its artwork, and the integrity of the market that supports it is vital to maintaining that heritage.""",1
197,A showcase for William Prince’s noble baritone,"Canadian musician William Prince graced the stage with his noble baritone voice at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco on Tuesday night. The audience was enthralled as he showcased songs from his latest album, ""Reliever,"" along with a selection of his earlier work.

Prince, who hails from Manitoba and is of Cree heritage, opened the show with the hauntingly beautiful track ""The Spark,"" setting a somber tone for the evening. He then transitioned seamlessly into more energetic tracks such as ""Always Have What We Had"" and ""Wasted.""

What particularly stood out was Prince's ability to effortlessly transition between genres, blending elements of folk, country, and rock into his signature sound. His performance of ""Rosehip Tea"" was a standout moment of the night, with the audience singing along to the catchy chorus.

Prince's between-song banter was also noteworthy, with him sharing stories about his family and heritage, as well as the inspiration behind certain songs. He even invited a young audience member up on stage to play the guitar during one of his songs, showcasing his down-to-earth personality.

Overall, Prince's concert was a beautiful showcase of his noble baritone voice, his versatility as a musician, and his genuine connection with his audience.",1
198,Microchips or microgreens? Oregon tweaks farm protection law,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — Oregon is tweaking its farm protection law to ensure that small-scale growers of microgreens, sprouts and other produce can thrive in the state’s burgeoning agricultural industry.

The state Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed legislation that exempts growers of sprouts and seeds from the state’s 2009 Food Safety Modernization Act, which required some small growers to test water and take other precautions aimed at preventing foodborne illnesses.

“The goal is to be able to sell a product locally without having to go through so many different regulations,” said Sen. Bill Hansell, a Republican who sponsored the bill. “It’s another one of those things that hinders small business development.”

Proponents of the legislation argue that the current law disproportionately affects farmers whose products are generally sold to local markets and are not shipped across state lines. Microgreens and sprouts are often used as toppings for sandwiches or salads, adding flavor and nutrition to the dishes.

The new legislation requires that growers register with the Oregon Department of Agriculture and maintain a system to track their products in case a foodborne illness outbreak occurs. The law also calls for the creation of a task force to study and make recommendations for improving food safety measures for small-scale growers.

The task force, which will include representatives from the agricultural industry, academia and the state government, will be tasked with studying the effects of the new legislation on small-scale growers.

Oregon has long been a leader in the nation’s farm-to-table movement, with many small-scale growers taking advantage of the state’s fertile soil and mild climate to produce crops such as kale, lettuce, tomatoes and berries.

But in recent years, the state has seen an explosion in the popularity of microgreens and sprouts, with many small growers setting up shop in urban areas such as Portland, Eugene and Bend.

While the new legislation has received widespread support from the agricultural industry, some critics have raised concerns about the potential risk of foodborne illnesses.

“Sprouts and microgreens are particularly susceptible to bacterial contamination, both in the growing and packing environments,” said Barbara Kowalcyk, CEO of the Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention. “There’s definitely some risk associated with this kind of farming.”

But advocates of the new legislation say that small-scale growers have a vested interest in ensuring the safety and quality of their products, and that the new law will help foster a culture of responsible farming practices.

“This is the kind of legislation that helps lift up small-scale farmers and gives them a sense of legitimacy,” said Laura Masterson, co-owner of 47th Avenue Farm in Portland. “It’s a step in the right direction for the state’s agricultural industry.”",1
199,"In India, mangrove trees make way for booming city of Kochi","In India, mangrove trees make way for booming city of Kochi

The changing face of India’s growing cities is nowhere more evident than in the southern city of Kochi. As it continues to expand and attract investment, there has been an increasing demand for land, which has come at the cost of the region's natural beauty and resources - notably, the loss of its rich mangrove forests.

Kochi, located in the state of Kerala, is the commercial hub of the region, and attracts tourists from around the world with its vibrant culture, food, and picturesque surroundings. The city’s former name, Cochin, was once synonymous with India’s spice trade, and the legacy of its centuries-old port still remains. However, the rapid growth of the city and its surrounding areas has led to the destruction of the once-abundant mangrove forests, leaving both environmentalists and locals concerned for the future of the region.

Mangrove forests are known for their ability to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere and provide various benefits including preventing floodings, hosting a diverse range of species, and stabilizing soils in coastal areas, among a long list of ecological and economic benefits. However, as industries such as construction, tourism, and aquaculture have expanded in Kochi, the mangroves have been cleared for development.

Kochi has been growing at an average rate of over 8% annually over the past two decades, ranking it among the fastest-growing cities in the country. As a result, mangrove forests in the surrounding backwaters and estuaries have been removed for the construction of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. The decline has also affected the fishery sector, as it depends on mangrove forests for fish breeding, something that people in the region have been known for, for centuries.

One area that has been affected deeply is Vembanad Lake, a vast network of lagoons that connects several rivers and streams, making it the longest lake in India, and the largest lake in the state of Kerala. It provides fresh-water for irrigation, drinking, and fishing to millions of people. Due to increasing urbanization and tourism, Vembanad Lake has been degraded over the years with alarming levels of pollution, forest encroachment, and development activities going on in the areas surrounding the lake. This has resulted in the loss of mangrove areas in the region.

In response to the loss of mangrove forests, the government of Kerala has launched a program to attempt to revive the area's wetlands, known as the 'Vembanad Wetland Conservation Program.' The initiative, which began in 2009, is aimed at preserving the wetlands and protecting its biodiversity. Its key objectives are to regenerate mangrove forests, controlling aquaculture through stringent regulations, and creating community-based tourism that protects the wetland’s ecology.

However, the local residents' view of the government’s move is far from positive. Many feel that the government's approach to conservation is too relaxed, and it is giving in too much to the interests of big corporations. There have been reports of encroachments in the wetlands by corporate firms, who have been trying to exploit the natural resources for commercial reasons, which have led to protests by local people.

The efforts of local communities to protect the mangroves have also been undermined by a lack of political will and insufficient resources. Environmentalists and local residents have been struggling to fight back against the destruction of mangrove forests in a city that is experiencing unprecedented growth.

Despite the detrimental effects of development on the local eco-system, Kochi may have some solutions to mitigate the impact of urbanization on its natural resources through the promotion of sustainable tourism. Kochi already has a number of initiatives aimed at promoting community-based tourism, which protects the environment and benefits local communities. This approach to tourism has the potential to be an effective means of conserving mangrove forests while also promoting economic growth.

The government of Kerala is also recognizing the importance of sustainable tourism and has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting eco-tourism in the state. One example is the ‘Green Carpet’ project, launched in 2017, which aims to reduce the adverse effects of tourism on the environment, focusing on the conservation of the Western Ghats, a mountain range in South India that is home to many endangered species.

However, to effectively maintain the balance between economic growth and conservation, greater investment and awareness are required that can come only from public-private partnerships, the promotion of ecotourism, and active participation of local residents. The people of Kochi must work to ensure that the city’s growth does not come at the expense of its vibrant and fragile ecosystems.

In conclusion, solving the ecological crisis in Kochi will take more than just efforts to revive the mangrove forests. A new approach to development and regional planning is needed that will balance the economic growth of the region with sustainable conservation practices that preserve the region’s natural heritage. Given Kerala's tradition of civic engagement and participatory democracy, there are reasons to believe that Kochi can lead the way in addressing the ecological crisis before it became too late. But this also calls for responsible reporting from the media, and public engagement in the conversation that must lead to a balanced approach for growth and ecological preservation.",1
200,Supreme Court won't block $6B student debt relief settlement,"The United States Supreme Court declined a request to block a $6 billion student loan relief settlement on Thursday, offering a moment of relief for the many borrowers affected by the troubled loan-servicing of Navient Corp.

Navient, one of the country's largest student loan servicers, was sued in 2017 following allegations that it harmed borrowers by incorrectly processing payments, providing incorrect information, and failing to address borrower complaints. In October of last year, Navient offered a $6.25 billion settlement to resolve the claims in the case, which brought together over 10,000 individual lawsuits.

However, a group of investors opposed to the settlement requested the Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the settlement was reached through ""improper collusion"" between Navient and plaintiffs. The Court declined to hear this request, ensuring that the settlement can continue.

The settlement will reportedly provide the affected borrowers with direct cash payments, as well as comprehensive debt relief that will aid borrowers in getting out of debt or avoiding future financial distress.

The ruling has been widely welcomed by advocates for student loan borrowers, as Navient manages over $300 billion in federal and private student loan debt for some 12 million Americans. It is hoped that this settlement will serve as a warning to other loan-servicing companies to prioritize the well-being of borrowers in their operations.",1
201,"Turkey, Egypt to reappoint ambassadors as ties improve","Turkey and Egypt have agreed to reappoint their respective ambassadors in a sign of thawing relations between the two countries. The move comes after a decade of tension, including the expulsion of ambassadors and the suspension of diplomatic ties.

In a statement released on Tuesday, the Turkish foreign ministry said that the two countries had agreed to take steps to improve bilateral relations. ""The two countries have decided to re-appoint their ambassadors in line with the normalization process between Turkey and Egypt,"" the statement said.

Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Huseyin Avni Botsali, was withdrawn in 2013, following the ousting of Islamist president Mohammed Morsi by the Egyptian military. Egypt subsequently withdrew its ambassador from Turkey, citing Ankara's support for the Muslim Brotherhood, a group which the Egyptian government considers a terrorist organization.

The resumption of diplomatic ties between the two countries follows a series of high-level visits and behind-the-scenes discussions. Last month, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, met with his Egyptian counterpart, Sameh Shoukry, on the sidelines of a regional summit in Athens. The two ministers were reported to have discussed ways to improve relations between their countries.

Turkey and Egypt have been at odds over a host of issues, including their conflicting positions on the conflicts in Syria and Libya. However, the two countries have recently expressed a desire to improve relations, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling for a ""new beginning"" in relations with Egypt earlier this year.

The reappointment of ambassadors is seen as an important first step in the normalization of relations between Turkey and Egypt. It is not yet clear when the appointments will take place, but the move is likely to be welcomed by both countries as a positive development in their troubled relationship.",1
202,Charged debate on Oregon gun bills reflects national divide,"SALEM, Ore. (AP) — A charged debate is brewing in the Oregon state legislature over a package of gun control bills, reflecting the deepening national divide on firearms legislation.

The bills being considered range from expanding background checks to restricting the sale of certain types of guns and ammunition. Advocates argue that such measures are necessary to reduce gun violence and protect public safety, while opponents contend they would infringe on Second Amendment rights and do little to deter criminals.

“This is a conversation about making our communities safer,” said state Sen. Rob Wagner, a Democrat and chief sponsor of the background check bill. “We have a constitutional right to bear arms, but we also have a right to live without the fear of gun violence.”

Opponents, however, argue that the bills would be ineffective in preventing crime, and would instead harm law-abiding gun owners.

“It’s not about the guns, it’s about the person behind the gun,” said state Sen. Kim Thatcher, a Republican who opposes the bills. “We need to focus on addressing the root causes of violence and providing resources to those who are struggling.”

The debate in Oregon mirrors similar battles being waged across the country, as advocates and opponents of gun control clash over the appropriate response to a series of mass shootings and other incidents of gun violence.

In recent years, several states have enacted stricter gun laws in response to such incidents, including Connecticut, New York, and Colorado. At the same time, other states, including Texas and Florida, have expanded gun rights, such as allowing concealed carry on college campuses and in churches.

These conflicting approaches have created a patchwork of laws across the country, with some states having relatively lax regulations while others have significantly stricter ones.

One such state is Oregon, which has a mixed record on gun control. While the state requires background checks for all gun purchases and has some restrictions on certain types of firearms, its laws still fall short of what advocates say is necessary to prevent gun violence.

The package of bills being considered by the legislature has generated significant opposition from gun rights advocates, who have flooded the Capitol with phone calls and emails urging lawmakers to vote against them.

One of the most controversial bills in the package would ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, which have been used in several mass shootings.

Opponents of the bill argue that such weapons are rarely used in crimes, and that banning them would do little to prevent violence.

“Assault weapons are not the problem,” said state Sen. Dennis Linthicum, a Republican who opposes the bill. “They are a tool that is used by law-abiding citizens for hunting, shooting sports, and self-defense.”

However, supporters of the bill say that such weapons are designed for military use, and have no place in civilian society.

“These weapons are engineered for one purpose: to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time,” said state Sen. Ginny Burdick, a Democrat and chief sponsor of the bill. “We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to keep them out of the wrong hands.”

Another bill being considered would expand background checks to cover nearly all gun sales in the state, including private transactions between individuals. Currently, only licensed gun dealers are required to conduct background checks on buyers.

Supporters of the bill say that the current system allows criminals and other prohibited persons to easily acquire firearms, and that expanding background checks would help to prevent such sales.

“We know that background checks work,” said Wagner. “They are a proven way to keep firearms out of the hands of those who should not have them.”

Opponents of the bill argue that requiring background checks for private sales would be burdensome and could lead to the creation of a registry of gun owners, which they say could be used by the government to confiscate firearms.

“This is a huge overreach by the government,” said Thatcher. “It’s not just about background checks, it’s about government control.”

Despite the opposition to the bills, Democrats, who have control of both chambers of the legislature, say they are committed to moving forward with the measures.

“We have a mandate from the people of Oregon to take action on gun violence prevention,” said state Rep. Andrea Salinas, a Democrat and chief sponsor of one of the bills. “We can’t sit idly by while people are dying.”

The debate over the gun control bills in Oregon is likely to continue in the coming weeks, as lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the issue try to make their voices heard. But regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the national divide on firearms legislation shows no signs of abating.",1
203,"Decade on, Boston Marathon bombing echoes","BOSTON (AP) — As the 10th anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing approaches, the city continues to grapple with the tragedy that shook its core and left an indelible mark on those who were present that day.

On April 15, 2013, two bombs detonated near the finish line of the historic race, killing three people and injuring hundreds more. The attacks were carried out by brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who planted explosives in backpacks left by the sidewalk.

The bombing was a shocking act of violence that rattled Boston and the world, leading to one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history as law enforcement agencies worked to track down the Tsarnaev brothers.

The younger brother, Dzhokhar, was captured and later found guilty of all 30 charges against him, including using a weapon of mass destruction and the killing of an MIT police officer. He was sentenced to death, but his sentence was later overturned and he is now serving life in prison without parole at a maximum security facility in Colorado.

The Tsarnaev brothers’ actions not only took innocent lives and injured many others, but also shattered the sense of safety and security in Boston.

For those who experienced the bombing firsthand, the memories of that day continue to haunt them.

“I can’t believe it’s been 10 years,” said Celeste Corcoran, who lost both of her legs in the bombing. “It feels like yesterday sometimes.”

Corcoran was at the finish line to cheer on her sister when the bombs went off. She and her daughter, who was also injured in the attack, have both undergone multiple surgeries and long, painful recoveries.

“Every day is a challenge,” Corcoran said. “But we keep moving forward. We don’t have a choice.”

Many others who were injured in the bombing have had similar experiences, with physical and emotional scars that have taken years to heal.

“The physical recovery was one thing, but the emotional toll has been even harder,” said Patrick Downes, who was standing near the finish line with his wife, Jessica Kensky, when the bombs went off. Both of them lost a leg as a result of the attack.

“We’ve had to learn how to live with this new normal,” Downes said. “But we’ve also found a lot of strength and resilience in ourselves and each other.”

The Boston Marathon is a beloved tradition in the city, attracting runners from around the world to compete in the historic race. After the bombing, there was concern that the event would never be the same again.

But Bostonians refused to let the tragedy define their city. In the years since the attack, the marathon has continued to thrive, with increased security measures and a heightened sense of community spirit.

“We’re not going to let anyone take this from us,” said Nina Sacco, a lifelong Boston resident who has run the marathon multiple times.

“In some ways, the bombing brought us together as a city,” Sacco said. “We realized that we’re stronger when we come together and support each other.”

In the aftermath of the bombing, there were also many acts of kindness and heroism that emerged. First responders rushed to the scene to treat the injured, and countless others offered their support in various ways.

One such act of kindness came from Carlos Arrendondo, who became known as “the man in the cowboy hat.” Arrendondo was at the marathon to support a runner in memory of his sons, who had both died in combat. After the bombs went off, he rushed to help those who were injured, using his own shirt to help stem the bleeding for one victim.

Arrendondo’s bravery and compassion became an emblem of the selflessness and resilience that Bostonians showed in the face of tragedy.

“In some ways, the bombing brought out the best in us,” said Arrendondo. “People were willing to put aside their differences and come together to support one another.”

But while Boston has shown strength and resilience in the years since the bombing, the impact of the attack is still felt deeply by many.

For some survivors, the anniversary brings up painful memories and a sense of loss. For others, it’s a reminder of the heroism and strength that emerged in the face of tragedy.

“I think about those who were lost and injured every day,” said Corcoran. “But I also think about how far we’ve come and how we’ve found ways to rebuild and support each other.”

As the marathon approaches this year, there will likely be increased security measures in place to ensure the safety of runners and spectators. But for many, the event remains a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.

“We’re not going to let fear stop us,” said Sacco. “That’s what the marathon is all about - pushing through the pain and the challenges to reach the finish line.”",1
204,Ash from Russian volcano prompts Alaska flight cancellations,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Ash from a Russian volcano has forced Alaska Airlines to cancel dozens of flights between the United States and Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.

The Pavlof volcano on the Alaskan Peninsula began erupting on Monday, spewing ash up to 20,000 feet into the air. Wind has carried the ash cloud over southwest Alaska and into the path of many flights heading to or from Anchorage.

As a result, Alaska Airlines cancelled 41 flights on Tuesday, affecting more than 3,300 passengers. The airline also announced the cancellation of 34 flights on Wednesday, with passengers being re-booked on later flights or given refunds.

“Safety is our top priority and, out of an abundance of caution, we’ve canceled flights that could be affected by the ash cloud,” said airline spokeswoman Bobbie Egan.

The ash cloud poses a significant risk to aviation because it can damage jet engines and reduce visibility for pilots. The Alaska Volcano Observatory has classified Pavlof’s eruption as a level 3, indicating that it is producing ash plumes, but not posing a danger to nearby communities.

Pavlof is one of Alaska’s most active volcanoes, having erupted more than 40 times since its first recorded eruption in 1762. It last erupted in 2016, prompting the cancellation of dozens of flights at the time.

Passengers affected by the cancelled flights are encouraged to check the airline’s website for updated information and to contact customer service for assistance with re-booking or refunds.",1
205,Musician Kauan Okamoto alleges talent manager assaulted him,"In a shocking development, musician Kauan Okamoto has come forward with allegations that his talent manager, whom he has chosen not to name, assaulted him.

Okamoto, a rising star in the Brazilian music scene, alleges that the assault took place during a meeting with his manager about his career trajectory. According to Okamoto, the conversation quickly turned heated and physical, with the manager allegedly attacking him.

""I couldn't believe it was happening,"" Okamoto said in an interview with AP News. ""I trusted this person with my career, and he violated that trust in the most horrific way.""

Okamoto says he initially struggled with reporting the incident, fearing that it would harm his career. But after speaking with friends and loved ones, he decided that he couldn't stay silent any longer.

""I realized that this isn't just about me,"" he said. ""It's about every artist who has ever been mistreated by someone in power. We need to speak out, no matter how scary or difficult it may be.""

The alleged assault has sparked outrage in Brazil's music community, with many artists and industry figures calling for a full investigation into the matter. Some have also expressed frustration with the music industry's lack of protections for artists in situations like these.

""It's heartbreaking to hear about what happened to Kauan,"" said fellow musician Ana Maria Braga. ""No one should have to go through something like that, especially not while trying to pursue their dreams.""

Okamoto says he hopes his decision to speak out will inspire others to do the same and help bring about change in the industry.

""I don't want anyone else to be hurt in this way,"" he said. ""We need to hold those in power accountable and make sure that artists are protected and respected.""

The alleged assault is just the latest in a series of high-profile scandals to rock the music industry in recent years. Earlier this year, multiple women accused R&B singer R. Kelly of sexual assault and abuse, leading to widespread outrage and calls for justice.

While it's too early to say what the outcome of Okamoto's allegations will be, many are hopeful that it will lead to meaningful change in the music industry and beyond.

""We can't let things like this continue to happen,"" said music journalist Julia Oliveira. ""It's time for us to take a stand and demand that artists are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.""",1
206,Officers plead not guilty in Ronald Greene's deadly arrest,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Three Louisiana State Police officers charged in the death of Ronald Greene pleaded not guilty on Monday.

Master Trooper Chris Hollingsworth died in a single-car crash last week just hours after he learned he had been fired and would be charged in Greene's death. Hollingsworth's lawyer, John McLindon, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf in front of East Baton Rouge Parish Judge Bonnie Jackson.

Jackson set a pretrial hearing for Nov. 10. McLindon said he will file a motion to quash the indictment, which he said is ""fundamentally flawed.""

Sgt. Kory York and Trooper Dakota DeMoss also pleaded not guilty on Monday. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Greene's death, which happened in 2019, long went unreported and unacknowledged by Louisiana State Police. But last year, an Associated Press investigation uncovered Greene's arrest and brutal treatment, calling into question State Police's handling of the case.

According to documents obtained by the AP, Greene was dragged out of his car and repeatedly punched in the face by troopers. Body camera footage showed troopers using a stun gun on Greene, wrestling him to the ground, and placing him in a chokehold.

He ultimately died in custody, with State Police offering different accounts of his death to different family members.

After the AP's report, State Police began a new investigation that culminated in the officers' arrests last month. All three were charged with injuring or killing Greene and with lying about the circumstances of his death.

The case has ignited protests and calls for justice around Louisiana. Activists have long criticized Louisiana law enforcement for its brutal treatment of Black people and other people of color.

LaKeitha Jefferson, Greene's mother, said Monday's hearing was a small step towards justice.

""I'm going to keep fighting until all of them pay for what they've done to my son,"" she told reporters outside the courthouse.

Lawyers for the officers have said they acted ""appropriately and lawfully"" in subduing Greene. They have also criticized State Police for not releasing full information about the case and for allowing a culture of brutality to fester within the department.",1
207,Volcano eruption in Russia's Kamchatka spews vast ash clouds,"A volcano in Russia's Kamchatka region erupted on Thursday, spewing a large ash plume into the sky and prompting warnings for local residents to stay indoors.

The Shiveluch volcano, one of the largest and most active in Kamchatka, erupted at 11:40 a.m. local time, throwing ash and gas clouds up to 10,000 meters high.

The Kamchatka Volcanic Emergency Response Team issued a warning for local residents to stay indoors and close their windows and doors to prevent ash from entering their homes.

The ash plume from the eruption was visible from neighboring towns, and authorities reported visibility being reduced to a dangerous level on some roads.

The Shiveluch volcano is one of the most active in Kamchatka and has erupted multiple times over the past decade. In 2016, it spewed ash up to 11,480 meters in the air, prompting flight cancellations and causing respiratory problems for local residents.

Kamchatka, a peninsula in Russia's far east, is home to about 30 active volcanoes and is a popular destination for tourists and researchers interested in geology and natural disasters.

Authorities in the area are monitoring the situation closely and have warned residents to prepare for possible evacuations if the situation deteriorates.",1
208,"Horses came to American West by early 1600s, study finds","New research has uncovered evidence that horses first arrived in what is now known as the American West by the early 1600s. The study, which was published in the journal Science Advances, offers insight into the impact that these animals had on the region's cultural and ecological history.

The researchers used a combination of genetic, archaeological, and historical evidence to determine the date of the arrival of horses. Genetic analysis of horse remains found in the region showed that they were genetically distinct from horses that had previously been in the Americas, indicating that they were brought over from elsewhere.

The researchers also looked at historical accounts from the time, such as Spanish colonial documents and Native American oral histories, which described the introduction of horses to the region. They found that these accounts consistently placed the arrival of horses in the early 1600s.

While horses are often associated with the American West, their origins are actually in Eurasia. Domesticated horses were initially used for transportation, and by the time they reached the Americas, they had been bred for centuries to enhance desirable traits such as speed and endurance.

The introduction of horses to the American West had a profound impact on the region's cultural and ecological history. They provided a faster and more efficient mode of transportation, which allowed for increased trade and communication between different groups of people. This led to the spread of new goods, ideas, and technologies across the region.

Horses also played a key role in warfare. Native American groups who had access to horses were better able to defend themselves against attacks from other groups, which allowed them to expand their territories and resources.

The ecological impact of horses in the American West was also significant. They are voracious grazers, and their introduction led to changes in the vegetation patterns and fire regimes of the region. The increased grazing pressure from horses also had an impact on other herbivores, such as bison and elk, which were forced to compete for limited forage.

Despite their many benefits, the introduction of horses was not without its challenges. They were a new and unfamiliar animal to many Native American groups, who had to adapt their hunting and gathering strategies to accommodate them. There were also concerns about the potential for horses to harm fragile ecosystems, particularly in areas where they were overgrazed.

Today, horses continue to play an important role in the American West. They are still used for transportation, but they also play a key role in many cultural traditions and events, such as rodeos and horse racing.

However, like many introduced species, horses also have the potential to cause environmental harm. In some areas of the West, wild horses have become overpopulated and are causing damage to fragile ecosystems. There are ongoing efforts to manage wild horse populations and balance their cultural and ecological significance with the need to protect the natural environment.

The study sheds new light on the early history of horses in the American West and highlights the complex interaction between humans and the environment in shaping the region's history. It underscores the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to understanding historical phenomena and the need for continued research to inform management decisions and conservation efforts.

As lead author Peter Heintzman of the University of Copenhagen noted in a press release, ""Understanding the origins of horses in the American West is not just about the past – it's also important for managing wild horse populations and responding to current environmental challenges.""",1
209,Russia identifies Ukrainian suspect in war blogger's killing,"Russia's Investigative Committee has identified a suspect in the 2014 killing of a Russian war blogger in eastern Ukraine. The suspect, identified as a Ukrainian citizen, allegedly shot and killed Timur Voronov while he was reporting on the conflict in the region.

Voronov, who was a pro-Kremlin blogger, was covering the conflict in eastern Ukraine when he was killed in May 2014. The investigation into his death has been ongoing since then, with Russian officials accusing Ukrainian nationalists of the killing.

However, the Ukrainian government has denied any involvement in Voronov's death, and has accused Russia of using the case to further its propaganda war against Ukraine.

The Investigative Committee, which is Russia's top law enforcement agency, has now announced that it has identified a suspect in Voronov's killing, and has issued an arrest warrant for him. The suspect, whose identity has not been disclosed, is believed to be living in Ukraine.

The Investigative Committee said in a statement that the suspect had been identified through ""complex investigative measures,"" and that it had ""irrefutable evidence"" of his involvement in the killing.

""The Investigative Committee has irrefutable evidence of the involvement of a Ukrainian citizen in the murder of Timur Voronov. We will use all legal means to bring the suspect to justice,"" the statement said.

The Ukrainian government has not yet responded to the announcement, but it is likely to reject the accusations and accuse Russia of using the case to further its propaganda war against Ukraine.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists has been ongoing since 2014, and has claimed more than 13,000 lives. The conflict has also led to a breakdown in relations between Russia and Ukraine, with both sides accusing the other of aggression and interference.

The killing of Voronov, who was known for his pro-Kremlin views and support for the separatists, was seen as a significant blow to the Russian propaganda effort in eastern Ukraine. It is unclear how the identification and arrest of a suspect will affect the conflict or the propaganda war.

However, the announcement is likely to further strain relations between Russia and Ukraine, which are already at a low point. The two countries have been locked in a diplomatic and military standoff since the conflict began in 2014, and have recently been involved in a series of tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats.

The identification of a suspect in Voronov's killing is likely to further escalate tensions between the two countries and raise questions about the legitimacy of the investigative process.",1
210,Judge cancels Montana gas plant permit over climate impacts,"In a landmark decision, a federal judge has cancelled a permit for a large natural gas plant in Montana. The ruling by Judge Brian Morris states that the project’s climate impacts were not properly considered when the permit was issued.

The proposed facility was set to be built in the city of Kalispell, with a capacity to process up to 150 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Its construction had been approved in 2019 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees permits for water infrastructure projects.

However, the project faced opposition from environmental groups, who argued that it would contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate climate change. The Sierra Club, one of the groups that sued the Army Corps over the permit, hailed the ruling as a victory for the climate.

“Today’s decision sends a clear message that we cannot continue to ignore the climate impacts of dirty fossil fuel projects like this,” said Rebecca Bowe, a senior policy analyst at the Sierra Club. “We need to be investing in clean energy solutions that will protect our planet and our communities, not doubling down on harmful practices that put us all at risk.”

In his decision, Judge Morris cited the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions. He noted that the Army Corps had failed to adequately assess the project’s greenhouse gas emissions and their potential effects on the climate.

“The Corps did not take the requisite hard look at the indirect environmental effects of the Project, including its contribution to climate change,” Morris wrote.

The judge also found fault with the Corps’ analysis of the project’s impacts on wetlands and waterways, and ordered the agency to revise its permit decision.

The ruling is the latest in a string of legal challenges to fossil fuel infrastructure projects around the country. In recent years, courts have cancelled permits for pipelines, coal mines, and other facilities on the basis of their climate impacts.

The decision comes as the Biden administration seeks to ramp up investment in clean energy and reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels. President Biden has made fighting climate change a top priority, and has promised to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.

Environmental groups are calling on the administration to use its authority to cancel or revise other permits for fossil fuel projects, and to block new ones from being approved. They say that such actions are necessary to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming and protect vulnerable communities.

“This decision demonstrates the importance of the courts in reigning in irresponsible federal agencies that prioritize the profits of corporations over the health and safety of people and the environment,” said Bowe. “We will continue to fight to protect our planet for future generations.”",1
211,Amari Bailey leaving UCLA after 1 season to enter NBA draft,"Amari Bailey, a freshman guard at UCLA, has announced that he will be leaving the school to enter the NBA draft. Bailey was a highly sought-after recruit, ranked among the top five players in the Class of 2021.

In his lone season with the Bruins, the 6-foot-4 guard averaged 10.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. He helped lead UCLA to the Final Four, where they ultimately fell to Gonzaga.

Bailey’s decision to leave after just one year at UCLA is not unusual in the current climate of college basketball. Many of the top recruits choose to attend college for one season before entering the NBA draft in hopes of being selected early and securing a lucrative contract.

Despite his youth and lack of experience, Bailey is widely regarded as a potential first-round pick in the upcoming NBA draft. His athleticism, quickness, and ability to score from anywhere on the court make him an attractive prospect for NBA teams.

While UCLA will undoubtedly miss Bailey’s contributions, they continue to recruit top talent and will look to reload for the upcoming season. As for Bailey, he will begin the draft preparation process and look to make a name for himself at the next level.",1
212,Insider Q&A-Benn Steil of the Council on Foreign Relations,"In this Insider Q&A, we speak to Benn Steil, the Senior Fellow and Director of International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Steil is a renowned economist, author and commentator on global economic issues. He is the author of several books including ""The Battle of Bretton Woods: John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White, and the Making of a New World Order,"" which won the 2013 Spear's Book Award in the category of Financial History.

AP: What do you think is the biggest challenge facing the global economy in the next few years?

Steil: I believe that the biggest challenge facing the global economy in the next few years is the rapid rise of China as an economic, technological and geopolitical power. The Chinese economy has grown tremendously over the past few decades and is now the second-largest economy in the world after the United States. This has significant implications for the global economy, especially given China's increasing integration into global trade networks and financial systems. The rise of China is also posing significant challenges for the United States, which has traditionally been the dominant global power.

AP: How can countries work together to address this challenge?

Steil: I think that countries need to work more closely together to address the challenge of China's rise. This will require cooperation and coordination on a wide range of issues, from trade and investment to cybersecurity and intellectual property protection. For example, countries may need to work together to enforce international trade agreements and protect against economic espionage and theft of intellectual property. They may also need to coordinate their policies on investment screening and technology transfer to ensure that critical technologies are not transferred to China without appropriate safeguards in place.

AP: Do you think that the coronavirus pandemic has changed the global economic landscape? If so, how?

Steil: The coronavirus pandemic has certainly had a significant impact on the global economic landscape. It has disrupted global supply chains, slowed economic growth, and caused significant volatility in financial markets. The pandemic has also led to increased government intervention in the economy, with many countries implementing stimulus measures to support their economies. In the longer term, the pandemic may also have lasting effects on the global economy, for example by accelerating trends towards digitalization and automation.

AP: How can countries work together to support economic recovery from the pandemic?

Steil: I believe that countries need to work together to support economic recovery from the pandemic. This will require cooperation and coordination on a wide range of issues, from vaccine distribution and travel restrictions to fiscal and monetary policy. Countries may need to coordinate their policies on debt relief and restructuring to support countries that are struggling with debt burdens. They may also need to coordinate their policies on trade and investment to ensure that supply chains are restored and the global economy can recover more quickly.

Overall, it is clear that the global economy is facing significant challenges in the years ahead, from the rise of China to the impact of the pandemic. However, if countries can work together more closely, there is hope that these challenges can be overcome and a more stable and prosperous global economy can emerge.",1
213,Latest ruling on pill shifts US abortion landscape again,"In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court has upheld a controversial Texas law that places additional restrictions on access to abortion-inducing medication. The law requires doctors to follow a strict FDA-approved protocol for administering the pills, which varies significantly from the common practice used by doctors throughout the country.

Opponents of the law argue that the FDA protocol is outdated and unnecessarily restrictive, while supporters claim that it ensures the safety of patients. The ruling is expected to have significant implications for reproductive healthcare in Texas and beyond, as other states may follow suit and enact similar legislation.

The decision comes just over a year after the Supreme Court struck down Texas' restrictions on abortion providers, known as HB2. Pro-choice advocates had hoped that the Court's decision in that case would put a stop to further efforts to limit access to abortion services in the state. Instead, the latest ruling underscores the ongoing battle over reproductive rights, and highlights the unpredictability of the Supreme Court's stance on these issues.

Reacting to the decision, Nancy Northup, President of the Center for Reproductive Rights, declared that ""Today's ruling sends a clear message that the Supreme Court is willing to sacrifice the health and rights of Texas women in order to satisfy an extreme political agenda.""

The Texas law in question, known as HB 3994, was enacted in 2013, and requires doctors to adhere to the FDA protocol for prescribing medication-induced abortions. The protocol, which was approved by the FDA in 2000 and has not been updated since, involves administering the pills in a specific order, and only within the first 49 days of pregnancy.

Critics of the protocol argue that it is outdated and unnecessarily restrictive. Many doctors, for instance, use a different protocol that is more flexible and can be used later in pregnancy. They argue that the FDA protocol was developed at a time when medication-induced abortion was considered experimental and that subsequent research has shown it to be safe and effective.

Supporters of the law, on the other hand, insist that the FDA protocol is necessary to ensure the safety of patients. They argue that the alternative protocols used by many doctors are untested and could lead to complications or even death.

The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the law means that doctors in Texas will now be required to follow the FDA protocol, and that women seeking abortion-inducing medication will face greater restrictions on when and how they can access the pills.

For women living in rural or remote areas, the decision is likely to have the most significant impact. As the Texas Observer reports, ""For Texas women who live in places without abortion clinics, telemedicine abortion can make a world of difference."" Telemedicine, which involves using videoconferencing technology to connect patients with doctors, allows women to access medication-induced abortion without having to travel long distances to a clinic.

Under the new law, however, telemedicine abortion will be effectively outlawed, as it would require doctors to deviate from the FDA protocol. This means that women in rural or remote areas will be forced to travel long distances to obtain an abortion, or else forego the procedure altogether.

Reproductive health advocates warn that the ruling could set a dangerous precedent for other states looking to restrict access to abortion. As more states adopt similar laws, the availability of medication-induced abortion will become increasingly limited, forcing women to either travel long distances to obtain the medication or undergo more invasive surgical procedures.

This, in turn, could have a chilling effect on women's access to reproductive healthcare more broadly. As the New York Times notes, ""If medication-induced abortion becomes virtually unavailable in large swaths of the country, it could set back access to abortion by decades.""

The Supreme Court's decision also highlights the fragility of reproductive rights in America. The landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade established a woman's right to choose abortion, but opponents of that decision have been chipping away at it ever since. As the Texas case shows, the fate of reproductive rights in America rests on the whims of the Supreme Court, which can be unpredictable and highly politicized.

In the wake of the latest ruling, advocates for reproductive rights are urging voters to pay close attention to the issue in the upcoming presidential election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has stated that she supports a woman's right to choose, while Republican nominee Donald Trump has called for abortion to be banned in most cases.

As the country prepares to elect a new president, the question of reproductive rights will likely be one of the defining issues of the 2016 campaign. With the fate of Roe v. Wade hanging in the balance, the stakes could not be higher for women across America.",1
214,Guardsman arrested in leak of classified military documents,"WASHINGTON D.C. - A member of the National Guard has been arrested in connection with the leak of classified military documents to an online media outlet. The 32-year-old Guardsman, whose name has yet to be released, was taken into custody on Friday and charged with unauthorized disclosure of classified information.

According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Guardsman is accused of providing classified military documents to an online media outlet, which published the information in a series of news articles. The documents are said to have contained information on military operations and intelligence gathering in the Middle East.

“This arrest sends a clear message that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information will not be tolerated and will be met with swift and decisive action,” said John Demers, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security.

The arrest comes amidst growing concerns over leaks of classified information from within the U.S. government. In recent years, several high-profile leaks have made headlines, including the release of classified documents by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and the WikiLeaks disclosures of U.S. diplomatic cables.

While the U.S. government has taken steps to crack down on leaks, critics argue that classified information is often over-classified in the first place, and that current whistleblower protections are inadequate.

“Classified designations should be used judiciously and with a presumption of openness,” said Alex Abdo, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. “The government must recognize that secrecy is not a virtue in itself and that transparency serves a vital public interest.”

The Guardsman’s arrest also comes as tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalate. The U.S. military has recently increased its presence in the region, citing what it calls “credible and imminent” threats from Iran. President Trump has also ratcheted up rhetoric against Iran, tweeting that “any attack by Iran will be met with great and overwhelming force.”

The leaked documents are said to have contained information on U.S. military operations in the Middle East, including details on training of Iraqi military forces and efforts to combat the Islamic State group. The documents are also said to have included intelligence on Iranian military and political activities in the region.

While it is unclear how the Guardsman obtained the documents or why he leaked them, experts say that leaks of classified information can have serious consequences for national security.

“Unauthorized disclosures of classified information can harm individual intelligence sources, damage military operations, and compromise U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer and whistleblower advocate.

The Guardsman is currently being held at a military detention center as the case proceeds. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison.

The case is also likely to raise questions about the role of the media in reporting on classified information. While the First Amendment protects freedom of the press, it does not grant journalists the right to possess or disclose classified information. Journalists who publish classified information can be subject to criminal charges, though such cases are rare.

In recent years, media organizations have faced mounting pressure from the U.S. government to reveal their sources of leaked information, with some journalists facing legal action for refusing to do so.

“The government’s crackdown on whistleblowers and journalists who report on classified information has a chilling effect on press freedom and the public’s right to know,” said Bruce Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

The case is also likely to spur debate over the use of the National Guard in military operations overseas. While the Guard is traditionally used for domestic emergencies and disaster relief, it has been increasingly deployed in overseas conflicts since the September 11 attacks. Critics argue that such deployments strain the guard’s resources and can undermine its ability to respond to domestic crises.

“The National Guard should not be used as a tool of overseas warfare,” said Chris Lombardo, a spokesperson for the National Guard Association of the United States. “It is not fair to the men and women of the Guard, who sign up to serve their communities, not fight foreign wars.”

As the case moves forward, it is likely to raise important questions about government secrecy, press freedom, and the role of the National Guard in military operations overseas. It is also a stark reminder of the ongoing debate over the balance between national security and individual liberties, and the importance of protecting both.",1
215,German government rejects new call to delay nuclear shutdown,"The German government has once again rejected a call to delay the shutdown of the country's nuclear power plants, despite concerns over energy supply and potential job losses in the industry.

The decision came after the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy conducted a review of the energy sector, which concluded that there was no need for a revision of the current deadline for the phase-out of nuclear power.

The German government and the country's energy companies had agreed to the nuclear phase-out in 2011, following the Fukushima disaster in Japan. The original deadline for the shutdown of all nuclear power plants was set for 2022.

However, some members of the energy industry have called for a delay to the phase-out, citing concerns over the security of energy supplies during times of peak demand and the potential loss of jobs in the nuclear sector.

One of the key arguments used by those calling for a delay is that Germany's move away from nuclear power has led to an increase in the use of coal, which is seen as a more harmfuild to the environment.

But the government's review found that the impact of the nuclear phase-out on energy supply was minimal, and that the increase in coal use had been offset by a rise in renewable energy production.

In a statement, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy said: ""The phase-out of nuclear power is a necessary and responsible step towards a sustainable energy supply. It is in the interest of Germany's long-term energy security and climate protection goals.""

The ministry added that the government would continue to support the nuclear industry during the phase-out process, including providing assistance to those affected by any job losses.

The decision to maintain the current nuclear phase-out deadline was welcomed by environmental groups, who argue that nuclear power is inherently risky and that the focus should be on developing cleaner, renewable energy sources.

""We applaud the government's decision to stick to the original plan for the phase-out of nuclear power. It sends a strong message that Germany is committed to a sustainable energy future,"" said Greenpeace Germany in a statement.

The German government's stance on nuclear power has been closely watched by other countries around the world, as many countries are also considering their own energy policies in the wake of the Paris climate agreement.

Environmental campaigners are hoping that Germany's success in transitioning away from nuclear power and increasing its renewable energy production will inspire other countries to follow suit.

As Germany looks toward a future without nuclear power, the focus now shifts to expanding renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, to ensure the country's energy needs are met in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way.",1
216,Scotty Bowman embracing hockey retirement role,"Scotty Bowman may be retired from coaching NHL teams, but his love for the sport continues in a new role.

The Hockey Hall of Famer has taken on an advisory role with the Chicago Blackhawks, where his son, Stan Bowman, is the general manager.

""I'm not going to be going to every game, but I'm going to watch them on TV,"" said Bowman in an interview with the Associated Press. ""Talk to some of the coaches, talk to some of the players, and give my opinions.""

Bowman, who turns 87 in September, won nine Stanley Cups as a head coach, the most in NHL history. He also served as a consultant with the Detroit Red Wings, with whom he won three of those championships, and the Buffalo Sabres.

But after decades of coaching, Bowman is enjoying the chance to still be involved in hockey without the stress of the daily grind.

""I've had a lot of years where you're always worried, 'Are you doing the right thing?'"" he said. ""Now it's a little more relaxing.""

The Blackhawks value Bowman's expertise as they look to rebuild their team after several years of missing the playoffs. His experience and knowledge of the game will be invaluable as they make decisions about player personnel, strategy and more.

""It's great to have somebody who brings that wealth of experience,"" said Stan Bowman. ""It's pretty unusual to have somebody like that who's been involved in the game for so long and has won so much.""

Scotty Bowman's role will also allow him to spend more time with his family, including his wife Suella, who has been dealing with a health issue.

""It's been a difficult time, but we're managing,"" said Bowman. ""I'm happy to stay home more and be able to help out.""

While Bowman is embracing his retirement role, he still misses the excitement of coaching on the ice.

""I miss the playoffs all the time,"" he said. ""You get that energy, that adrenaline. You feel like you're doing something.""

But for now, he's happy to share his knowledge with others and watch the game he loves continue to grow and evolve.

""It's been great to see the development of the game,"" he said. ""The speed, the skill level. It's just amazing.""",1
217,Scorsese waltzes with David Johansen in 'Personality Crisis',"Legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese has proven once again that he is not only a master behind the camera but also a connoisseur of music. Scorsese passionately embraces his love for blues, rock, and punk rock music, and has been known for infusing his films with memorable musical moments. In his latest project, Scorsese and ex-New York Dolls frontman David Johansen take us on a journey through the streets of New York City in ""Personality Crisis.""

""Personality Crisis"" is a new PBS documentary film produced by Martin Scorsese, chronicling the rise of the New York Dolls and the punk rock scene in New York City in the early 1970s. The film provides insights into the band's signature sound, their wildly outrageous on-stage personas, and the influence they had on the music industry.

It's easy to see why Scorsese chose to collaborate with David Johansen for this project. The two artists share an undeniable love for music, and their passion is evident throughout the documentary.

""When I first saw the New York Dolls, it was like somebody had just switched on a light in my head,"" Scorsese explains in the documentary. ""I couldn't believe the sound they were making, and the way they looked, and the attitude they had. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.""

Throughout the documentary, Scorsese uses Johansen's music to transport the viewers to the streets of New York City in the 1970s. Johansen's charismatic personality shines through as he talks about his experiences with the band and the punk rock scene.

""I think the New York Dolls were the original punk rock band,"" Johansen proclaims. ""We were just a bunch of guys from New York City who loved rock and roll and wanted to play it our way. We didn't care about fitting in or following the trends. We were just being ourselves.""

The film also features interviews with other key figures who were a part of the punk rock movement in the 70s, such as Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry, and Alice Cooper. Their insights add depth to the documentary and underline the cultural significance of the punk rock era.

But at the heart of the film is the music. Johansen performs several of the New York Dolls' most iconic songs throughout the documentary, including ""Personality Crisis,"" ""Looking For a Kiss,"" and ""Jet Boy."" These performances are raw and energetic, transporting the viewer back to a time when punk rock was just starting to emerge as a genre.

""It's so refreshing to see a documentary that is so focused on the music,"" said music critic Robert Christgau. ""I love how Scorsese and Johansen aren't afraid to let the music speak for itself. The performances in this film are truly something special.""

In addition to the interviews and performances, ""Personality Crisis"" also features archival footage of the band and the New York punk rock scene. These clips provide insight into the band's volatile history and highlight the importance of the punk rock movement in New York City's cultural history.

Overall, ""Personality Crisis"" is a must-see for music lovers and fans of Scorsese's work alike. It's a journey through a time and place where garage rock, glam rock, and punk rock all collided to create something truly unique. The documentary is a testament to the power of music and its ability to connect people from different backgrounds and experiences.

But perhaps the most impressive thing about ""Personality Crisis"" is the collaboration between Scorsese and Johansen. The two artists bring out the best in each other, and the documentary is a reflection of their shared love for music and their shared experiences as New Yorkers.

""Working with Martin on this film has been an incredible experience,"" Johansen said in an interview. ""He's such a passionate filmmaker, and he really knows how to capture the essence of a moment. I'm so grateful to have been a part of this project.""

For Scorsese, ""Personality Crisis"" is the latest addition to a legacy of films that have been shaped by music. From ""Mean Streets"" to ""The Departed,"" Scorsese has always understood the role that music plays in the lives of his characters and the culture at large.

""With this documentary, I wanted to capture the spirit of a time and a place,"" Scorsese explained. ""And I think David's music does that perfectly. He's a true New Yorker and a true artist, and I feel fortunate to have been able to work with him on this project.""

""Personality Crisis"" premiered at the Venice Film Festival and has received widespread critical acclaim. It's now available to stream on PBS and is sure to be a hit with fans of the New York Dolls and punk rock music in general. Martin Scorsese and David Johansen have created a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come.",1
218,"IMF's outlook, small business squeeze","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its latest World Economic Outlook report on Tuesday, shedding light on the state of the global economy amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While the report provides some hope for a recovery in 2021, it also highlights the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the need for targeted support to help them survive and thrive.

The IMF projects a global GDP contraction of 4.4% in 2020, which is slightly less severe than its June forecast of a 5.2% decline. The report credits the improvement to better-than-expected growth in the US and Europe in the third quarter, as well as the easing of lockdown measures across many countries. However, the IMF warns that the recovery remains uncertain and uneven, with new virus outbreaks and resurgences threatening to derail progress.

Moreover, the IMF notes that SMEs, which account for around 90% of businesses worldwide and employ about two-thirds of the global workforce, have borne the brunt of the economic fallout from the pandemic. Many SMEs have faced severe cash flow problems, reduced demand, disrupted supply chains, and regulatory barriers, among other challenges. These factors could reduce their output and productivity by up to 17% in the long run, according to the report.

The IMF argues that SMEs are critical for sustainable and inclusive growth, job creation, innovation, and trade, especially in emerging markets and low-income countries. However, many SMEs operate in sectors that have been hardest hit by the pandemic, such as tourism, hospitality, retail, and services. Therefore, the IMF calls for targeted policies and interventions to help SMEs overcome their liquidity and solvency issues and preserve their productive capacity and employment.

One such policy is the targeted and flexible use of fiscal and monetary support measures, such as grants, loans, guarantees, tax relief, and debt restructuring. The IMF notes that such measures should be tailored to the specific needs and constraints of SMEs, such as their size, sector, stage of development, and level of informality. Moreover, the IMF recommends that such measures should be transparent, efficient, and coordinated across different levels of government and financial institutions.

The IMF also stresses the importance of improving SMEs' access to financial services, including digital and mobile banking, non-bank financing, and credit reporting. The report notes that many SMEs face high borrowing costs, collateral requirements, and a lack of credit history, which limit their ability to invest, expand, and innovate. Therefore, the IMF suggests that policymakers should encourage the development of a supportive and diverse ecosystem of financial providers, including fintech firms, microfinance institutions, and credit guarantee schemes.

Furthermore, the IMF highlights the need to address the structural and systemic barriers that hinder SMEs' participation in global value chains and trade. The report notes that SMEs in emerging markets and developing economies face numerous hurdles, such as trade tariffs, non-tariff barriers, regulatory complexity, and lack of information and skills. Therefore, the IMF recommends that policymakers should prioritize trade facilitation and capacity-building measures that promote SMEs' competitiveness and integration into global markets, including e-commerce and cross-border digital transactions.

The IMF's outlook and recommendations align with the calls from various SME advocacy groups and organizations, which have been urging governments and international institutions to recognize and support the vital role of SMEs in the economic recovery. For instance, the International Trade Centre (ITC), a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, has launched a COVID-19 SME Response Portal that provides SMEs with free access to practical tools and resources on topics such as finance, marketing, and sustainability.

Similarly, the Global SME Finance Forum (GSFF), a network of SME finance experts and institutions, has held a series of webinars and events to share best practices and innovations in SME financing and digitalization. The GSFF has also developed a COVID-19 Response and Recovery Facility that offers SME lenders and investors a platform to exchange ideas and collaborate on solutions to support SMEs.

In conclusion, the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report underscores the severity and complexity of the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the crucial role of SMEs in the recovery. The report calls for targeted and flexible policies and interventions that address the liquidity, solvency, and competitiveness issues facing SMEs, as well as the structural and systemic barriers that limit their growth and participation in global value chains and trade. By implementing such measures, governments and financial institutions can help SMEs overcome the squeeze and build a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable economy for all.",1
219,Emotions high at French protests over Macron's pension plan,"PARIS (AP) -- Emotions ran high on Thursday in Paris and across France at large, as people protested President Emmanuel Macron's proposed pension plan. The rallies, dubbed ""Black Thursday,"" brought together tens of thousands of people, including transport workers, teachers, students, and other workers concerned about the implications of the new scheme on their future.

Government officials insist that the changes will simplify the current system by unifying the pensions of different professions, ensuring that everyone is treated equally. But there is considerable concern that it will lead to many people having to work longer and receiving smaller pensions in return.

As crowds marched along the city's streets, the air was filled with chants, cries of defiance and anger, and the occasional firework being let off. Despite the largely peaceful nature of the protests, there were some instances of violence reported, with police firing tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters who had set fire to bins in a number of locations.

Paris resident Antoine Richler, 33, who works in the finance sector, said he was worried that the new pension plan would mean he would be working for much longer than he currently anticipated, possibly even into his 70s. ""This is going to really hurt people like me who have worked hard and played by the rules,"" he said.

For many public sector workers, the changes to the pension system are just one more battle in a series of disputes with the government over proposed austerity measures. The country has already seen a number of strikes and protest movements over issues such as wage cuts, layoffs, and tax hikes in recent years.

Speaking to reporters, Philippe Martinez, head of the CGT union, one of the largest in France, said that the pension reforms were an attack on workers' rights. ""We won't give up easily, because we know that this is something important and that affects not just us, but everybody in the country,"" he said.

The protests come at a challenging time for Macron, who has been struggling to maintain his popularity ratings since being elected in 2017. With the country's economic situation far from stable, many are worried that the proposed pension changes will only serve to deepen the divide between the rich and the poor in France.

Karine Roach, a teacher from Bordeaux who was taking part in the protests, said she was frustrated with the state of the country's education system, which she said was already facing serious cuts. ""We're really worried about the future of our children,"" she said. ""If we don't fight for our working conditions now, then what will happen in the next ten years?""

Despite the widespread demonstrations and vocal opposition to the pension reform, Macron has so far shown no signs of backing down on the issue. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, he insisted that the current system was unsustainable and that the proposed changes were necessary for the long-term stability of the country.

""This is not a matter of choice, but of necessity,"" he said. ""We need to ensure that everyone can retire with dignity and security, and that we have a system that is fair and transparent for all.""

As the day wore on, the protests continued to spread, with people taking to the streets in other major cities such as Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse. Many businesses had closed their doors for the day, in anticipation of the protests, and there were reports of significant disruption to transport links across France.

Despite the frustrations of those taking part in the protests, there was also a sense of solidarity and a shared sense of purpose. As one sign held aloft on the streets of Paris read: ""We're all in this together.""",1
220,Can therapy help make you richer?,"In today's fast-paced world, money seems to be the solution to almost all our problems. From rent and groceries to vacations and luxuries, everything requires a certain amount of money. As a result, every individual is looking for ways to increase their income and achieve financial stability. While some people turn to investments and business ventures, others try to improve their career prospects. However, there's one unconventional method that's been gaining traction recently- therapy.

Yes, you read that right- therapy. While therapy has always been associated with mental health and emotional well-being, a growing number of people are turning to therapists to help them achieve financial success. The idea behind this is simple- our mindsets and beliefs play a significant role in determining our financial situation. And therapy can help us identify and break down the negative thought patterns and behaviors that might be holding us back.

According to a survey by the American Psychological Association, stress related to money and finances is one of the most common sources of stress amongst Americans. And this stress doesn't just affect our mental health- it also has a significant impact on our physical health and well-being. From high blood pressure and heart problems to sleep disorders and anxiety, financial stress can cause a range of health issues.

A study by the National Institute of Mental Health found that individuals with anxiety and depression are more likely to have problems with debt and financial management. And the reverse is also true- people with financial difficulties are more likely to experience mental health issues. This vicious cycle can be hard to break, and that's where therapy comes in.

Therapists can help individuals identify the negative thoughts and beliefs that are contributing to their financial stress. These thoughts and beliefs might include things like ""money is evil,"" ""I don't deserve to be rich,"" or ""rich people are greedy and selfish."" These beliefs can limit your earning potential and hold you back from exploring new opportunities.

Once these negative beliefs have been identified, therapists can help individuals work towards replacing them with more positive, empowering beliefs. This can involve challenging the negative beliefs with evidence and rational thought or using techniques like visualization to envision a more positive future.

Therapy can also help individuals identify their financial goals and develop a plan to achieve them. This can include setting a budget, creating a savings plan, and exploring different investment options. Therapists can also help individuals develop healthy spending habits and resist the temptation to overspend or make impulsive purchases.

Therapy can help individuals improve their relationship with money and develop a healthier, more positive mindset towards finances. This can lead to an improvement in job performance and career prospects, as well as an increase in income and financial stability.

One example of the success of therapy in financial matters is the story of Tom, a 35-year-old software engineer. Tom had always struggled with money. Despite earning a good salary, he found himself living paycheck to paycheck and unable to save for the future. He also had a fear of money and felt guilty whenever he spent it, which often led to impulsive purchases.

Tom sought the help of a therapist, who helped him identify the root of his negative beliefs and behaviors. Through therapy, Tom was able to identify his fear of money as stemming from his parents, who constantly argued about finances when he was growing up. He also realized that he had been holding onto negative beliefs about money, such as ""wealthy people are greedy,"" that were limiting his earning potential.

With the help of his therapist, Tom was able to work through these negative beliefs and develop a more positive mindset towards money. He created a budget, started saving a portion of his income every month, and invested in stocks and bonds. Over time, Tom's income increased, and he was able to achieve financial stability. He also felt less stressed and anxious about money and was able to enjoy his life more.

While therapy for financial success might sound unconventional, it's not a new idea. Financial therapists have been around for several years now, helping people overcome their money-related stresses and achieve their financial goals. In fact, the number of financial therapists has been steadily increasing in recent years, with more and more people realizing the benefits of therapy for their financial well-being.

The benefits of therapy for financial success are undeniable. Not only can therapy help individuals identify and break down their negative beliefs and behaviors, but it can also help them develop healthier spending and saving habits, as well as create a more positive mindset towards money. All of these factors contribute to an improvement in career prospects and income, as well as a decrease in financial stress and anxiety.

However, it's important to note that therapy alone may not be enough to guarantee financial success. While therapy can be a valuable tool in improving your relationship with money, it also requires dedication and hard work on your part. You need to be willing to implement the changes suggested by your therapist and follow through with your financial goals.

In conclusion, therapy for financial success might sound unconventional, but it's a trend that's here to stay. If you're struggling with financial stress or looking to improve your earning potential, therapy might be the answer you're looking for. By breaking down negative beliefs and behaviors and developing healthier spending and saving habits, you can achieve financial stability and improve your overall quality of life.",1
221,"In Kerala, an aging trend bucks India's booming population","In Kerala, an aging trend bucks India's booming population

In India's southern state of Kerala, a unique demographic trend is playing out. While the country as a whole is experiencing a population boom, with projections putting the total at 1.7 billion by 2050, Kerala's population is not only growing more slowly, but it is also getting older.

According to Indian census data, Kerala's population growth rate has fallen from 9.4% in 1971 to 4.9% in 2011. That's still higher than the national average of 1.2%, but it's a sharp drop nonetheless. And the state's median age is rising: from 26.7 in 1971 to 36.1 in 2011. By comparison, the national median age is 27.9.

Experts say the reasons for Kerala's aging trend are complex and multifaceted. One factor is the state's long history of social and economic development, which has led to high levels of education and women's empowerment. As a result, Kerala has one of the highest literacy rates in India, at around 96%, and women's participation in the labor force is among the highest in the country. This has led to a greater emphasis on family planning and smaller family sizes, which in turn has led to a slower population growth rate.

Another factor is the state's high life expectancy, which is the highest in India. Kerala's health system, backed by a strong tradition of public health and a robust primary care network, has made significant progress in reducing mortality rates for communicable diseases, maternal and child health, and non-communicable diseases. As a result, Kerala has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in India, and overall life expectancy is almost 76 years, compared to the national average of 69.3 years.

The aging trend in Kerala has important implications for the state's economy and society. As the population ages, there will be fewer young people to support the elderly through the traditional family structure. This could lead to increased demand for healthcare services, social security schemes, and pensions. In addition, there could be a shortage of labor in key sectors, such as healthcare and construction, as younger workers move out of the state to seek better job opportunities elsewhere.

But the aging trend could also bring some benefits. With fewer children and a larger proportion of elderly people, there could be more resources available for education, healthcare, and social security. Family sizes are likely to become even smaller, which could reduce poverty and improve the status of women.

However, experts caution that there are risks associated with an aging population. One concern is that the government may struggle to finance increased spending on social security and healthcare. Kerala already has a high debt burden, and funding for pensions and other benefits could be a major challenge.

Another concern is that the decline in population growth could lead to a decline in economic growth. Young people are often the drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship, and with fewer of them, there could be less dynamism in the economy. Experts also warn that an aging population could lead to a decline in social cohesion as different age groups have different priorities and interests.

Despite these challenges, Kerala's aging trend is being viewed as an opportunity by some. The state government has launched a ""Silver Surge"" program to tap into the potential of its elderly population. The program aims to create employment opportunities for seniors, promote intergenerational dialogue, and provide support for caregivers.

In addition, several organizations in Kerala are working to address the needs of the elderly. The HelpAge India Society, for example, provides healthcare, advocacy, and social support for senior citizens. Another organization, the Anuvrat Global Organization, runs a home for the aged and provides training and employment opportunities for seniors.

The aging trend in Kerala is also prompting a rethink of traditional attitudes towards aging and elderly care. In a society that has long valued youth and productivity, there is now a growing recognition of the contributions and needs of the elderly. Some experts argue that the aging trend could ultimately lead to a more compassionate and inclusive society, one that recognizes the value of intergenerational cooperation and solidarity.

As the world grapples with the challenges of an aging population, Kerala's experience offers important lessons. By investing in education, healthcare, and social development, the state has achieved impressive gains in life expectancy and quality of life. But the aging trend also highlights the need for new policies and approaches that recognize the changing demographics of society. Whether Kerala can leverage its unique demographic situation to build a more inclusive and sustainable future remains to be seen.",1
222,Cyprus probes citizens named over Russian sanctions evasion,"Cyprus authorities are investigating several of its citizens who have been named in connection with a money-laundering scheme that is suspected to have helped Russians evade U.S. sanctions.

The case is part of a wider investigation by the U.S. Treasury into individuals and businesses believed to have helped Russian oligarchs skirt sanctions imposed by the United States since 2014. Investigations into these activities have already led to sanctions on many individuals and businesses.

The Cypriot probe follows the U.S. Treasury’s recent imposition of sanctions on several individuals and companies, including Russian financier Yuri Lunin and his company, Navigo Management Ltd. The U.S. Treasury accused him of using his company to launder money for Russian oligarchs blacklisted by the United States.

According to the U.S. Treasury, Lunin and his company used a complex web of offshore companies and bank accounts, including those registered in Cyprus, to move millions of dollars on behalf of sanctioned individuals and entities.

The state’s attorney general, Costas Clerides, announced that the suspected individuals and companies in the Cypriot case were already under investigation.

Under Cyprus law, money-laundering is punishable by a maximum sentence of seven years in prison and a substantial fine.

Cyprus officials have tightened regulations to address concerns about illegal activity, including introducing measures to prevent the use of shell companies to evade taxes and regulations. However, such measures have often been criticized for falling short of preventing money-laundering and other illicit activities.

The authorities in Cyprus have pledged to work closely with international law enforcement agencies to investigate these allegations and ensure that individuals and companies that facilitate money-laundering face consequences for their actions.",1

224,U.N chief calls for massive international support to Somalia,"The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, has called for increased international support to aid Somalia as the country battles insecurity, poverty, and famine.

Guterres made the call in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, during his official visit. He stressed that the country urgently needs more international assistance, especially in the areas of security, humanitarian aid, and infrastructure development to support national reconstruction efforts.

""Famine is stalking Somalia again, and the world must act decisively to avert the worst. Somalia cannot afford another famine,"" Guterres warned.

The United Nations has warned that over 5 million people in Somalia are at risk of dying from an acute shortage of food, water, and medical supplies. This impending humanitarian crisis has been worsened by protracted conflict, droughts, and frequent terror attacks, which have caused mass displacement and humanitarian emergencies across the country.

Guterres has called on the international community to provide greater financial support to meet the needs of Somalia's most vulnerable people. He also encouraged the Somali leadership, including the federal government, regional leaders, and civil society, to work together to address the country's challenges.

Additionally, the Secretary-General expressed his support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its mandate to support the federal government's efforts to restore peace and stability in the country.

Somalia has been grappling with insecurity and political instability for the past three decades, which have hampered economic growth and development. The recent terror attacks by Al-Shabaab militants and bombings by ISIS have further complicated the situation, prompting the UN and other international organizations to intensify their efforts to provide assistance to the country.

Guterres' visit to Somalia highlights the urgent need to assist Somalia in addressing these challenges and rekindling hope in the country's long-term prosperity. With a concerted international effort, Somalia can rebuild itself and move forward to a more prosperous future.",1
225,Powerful Cyclone Ilsa lashes Australia's northwest coast,"A powerful cyclone named Ilsa has hit the northwest coast of Australia. This potent storm has caused widespread damage and destruction across the region. The impact of the cyclone has been felt by thousands of people living in the area, including local residents, businesses, and infrastructure.

The cyclone hit the coast early in the morning, bringing with it strong winds and heavy rainfall. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology reported that the cyclone had sustained winds of 215 km/h (133 mph). The authorities had urged the residents to leave the area or take shelter as the cyclone approached, but not everyone heeded the warnings.

According to reports, the storm caused widespread power outages, and many businesses and residences had to shut down. Several buildings have sustained severe damage, and the authorities have urged people not to travel until the warning is lifted. The storm has also caused severe flooding in some areas.

Emergency services have been receiving many calls from the affected region, and the local authorities have urged people to stay safe and stay indoors if possible. The government has set up emergency shelters for people who need them, and relief efforts are underway.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement, ""Our thoughts are with those impacted by Cyclone Ilsa, and we are working to provide immediate support to those who need it. We urge everyone in the affected areas to stay safe and listen to the advice of the emergency services.""

Cyclones are not uncommon in this region of Australia, but Ilsa is one of the most powerful and destructive storms to hit the area in recent years. The authorities are urging people to take the threat seriously and prepare for the possibility of more severe weather in the future.

The cleanup and recovery efforts are expected to take months, and the government has promised to provide support and assistance to affected communities. The cyclone reminds us of the importance of being prepared for extreme weather events and taking precautions to protect ourselves and our property.",1
226,Concerned US states start stockpiling abortion drugs after court ruling,"Following the recent Supreme Court ruling that could potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, several US states have started to stockpile medication abortion drugs in preparation for the possible loss of access to safe and legal abortions.

According to officials in Illinois, Vermont, and Maine, these states have started to purchase additional stocks of medication abortion pills in order to ensure that individuals seeking abortions have access to them even if the procedure is outlawed in the coming months or years. Other states are also considering similar measures, as lawmakers and health care providers fear that abortion rights could be entirely revoked if the Supreme Court overturns Roe.

The decision to stockpile abortion medication comes after the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a major case involving Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court rules in favor of Mississippi, it could potentially allow other states to ban abortion at even earlier stages of pregnancy or outrightly ban the procedure altogether. 

Abortion rights advocates argue that this would be a devastating blow to reproductive rights, and it would put the health and safety of millions of women and pregnant individuals across the United States in jeopardy.

""We're facing a potential post-Roe reality where abortion is not accessible in many states,"" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a physician and director of ANSIRH, a reproductive health research group. ""In some states, it will continue to be available, but in others, it won’t. Women will be forced to travel for care, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Stockpiling medication abortion pills is one way to mitigate this harm.""

Medication abortion involves taking two pills – mifepristone and misoprostol – which are administered over the course of several days. The pills have been proven to be safe and effective, with a success rate of over 95 percent for terminating early pregnancies. Advocates argue that stocking up on these medications would give people an alternative to surgical procedures that may be more difficult to access.

In some cases, these medications can even be delivered via telemedicine or through the mail, making it easier for people living in remote or rural areas to access reproductive healthcare. However, opponents of abortion have long criticized the use of medication abortion, arguing that it is unsafe and can put women's health at risk.

As states prepare for a potential future without legal abortion, some anti-abortion groups are also ramping up their efforts to restrict access to medication abortion. Earlier this year, the FDA temporarily lifted restrictions on mail-order abortion medication due to the pandemic. But some conservative lawmakers and organizations have pushed for the restrictions to be reinstated, arguing that medication abortion should only be available in clinical settings with direct supervision from a physician.

Despite the potential challenges that lie ahead, advocates say they will continue to fight for reproductive rights and access to safe and legal abortions. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, four women who have had abortions wrote: ""We know that nobody can forcibly take away our experiences, but we also know that nobody can guarantee our safety as we seek reproductive health care in a hostile environment.""

In the meantime, states that are stockpiling medication abortion pills say they are doing so to ensure that individuals have access to safe and effective reproductive health care. ""We know that access to reproductive health care isn't a luxury, it's a fundamental right,"" said Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. ""And we will do everything in our power to ensure that people in our state can exercise that right – no matter what happens at the Supreme Court.""

Despite the challenges faced by reproductive rights advocates, many remain hopeful that the resounding support for safe and legal abortions will enable them to continue to provide crucial care to those who need it most. 

""Our right to make our own reproductive choices is not negotiable,"" said the women who authored the op-ed. ""Our lives depend on it.""",1
227,Germany approves Poland's request to send jets to Ukraine,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany has approved Poland's request to send fighter jets to support Ukraine's military efforts against Russian aggression, the defense ministry said on Monday.

Poland had asked Germany to allow its air force to fly six F-16 jets over German territory as part of a mission to provide support for Ukraine, which has been in conflict with Russian-backed separatists since 2014. The request was approved by the German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.

""Germany stands in solidarity with Ukraine in its efforts to defend its sovereignty,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a statement. ""We support the use of our airspace by European allies who want to provide military assistance to Ukraine.""

The jets are expected to fly from Poland to Ukraine and back over German territory, without landing in Germany. The exact timing of the flights has not been announced.

The decision to grant permission to Poland signals a shift in Germany's position on the conflict in Ukraine, where Russia has annexed Crimea and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine. Germany had previously been cautious about taking a more aggressive stance against Russia, due to its dependence on Russian gas and its desire for dialogue with Moscow.

However, there has been growing concern among German politicians over Russia's recent military buildup near the Ukrainian border. Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed concern about the situation and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions.

The approval of Poland's request was welcomed by Ukrainian officials, who have been seeking greater support from Western allies. A statement from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry thanked Germany for its ""solidarity"" and said the F-16 jets would ""make a significant contribution to the defense of Ukraine.""

The move comes as NATO and the United States have increased their military presence in Eastern Europe in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The alliance has also provided military aid to Ukraine, including training, equipment, and financial support.",1
228,Asian shares mixed after Wall St dips on weak economic data,"Asian shares were mixed on Thursday, following Wall Street's lead as it dipped on weak economic data. Investors continue to keep a close eye on the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which could provide clues on when the central bank will begin to taper its bond purchases.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.7% to 28,118.03 in morning trading, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.1% to 7,533.30. South Korea's Kospi also gained 0.1% to 3,207.29. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.6% to 26,191.62. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2% to 3,464.29.

The global coronavirus pandemic continues to impact economies worldwide, with Japan reporting a larger contraction than previously anticipated as it struggles to control the virus. Additionally, China's factory output, retail sales and other indicators have been slowing, leading to concerns about the health of its economy.

Investors are also closely following the US policy meeting, which takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. Many experts predict that the Fed will announce a timeline for tapering its bond purchases, which could have a significant impact on financial markets around the world.

This has led to increased volatility and uncertainty among investors, who are weighing the possibility of reduced stimulus against the potential for higher inflation and rising interest rates. In addition, the ongoing tensions between China and the United States continue to add to market uncertainty.

Despite these challenges, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the future of the global economy. ""We see signs that the global economy is recovering,"" said John Derrick, director of research at Pioneer Investments. ""However, challenges remain, particularly in the face of the pandemic and geopolitical tensions.""

Overall, it seems that investors will be keeping a close eye on any developments out of the US Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which could have a significant impact on financial markets in the weeks and months ahead. As always, investors are advised to remain cautious and to carefully evaluate any potential risks when making investment decisions.

The mixed performance of Asian shares on Thursday also reflects the broader challenges faced by the global economy as it continues to grapple with the pandemic and its economic fallout. While there are some signs of progress, there is still a great deal of uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.

Despite these challenges, however, there are reasons for optimism as well. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its global growth forecast for 2021, citing the continued rollout of vaccinations and massive government stimulus programs as drivers of economic recovery.

Of course, the future remains uncertain, and many factors could still impact the trajectory of the global economy. But for now, investors around the world will be closely watching events as they unfold in the days and weeks ahead, hoping for continued progress and sustained economic growth.",1
229,Ian was Cat 5 before weakening at Florida landfall,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Hurricane Ian made landfall on Florida's northwest coast on Friday as a Category 5 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph, before weakening as it moved inland.

The powerful storm caused widespread damage to homes and businesses and left thousands without power.

Officials had urged residents to evacuate and seek shelter ahead of the storm's arrival, but some chose to ride out the hurricane in their homes.

Ian made landfall around 3 p.m. Eastern time near the small town of Cedar Key, located about 50 miles west of Gainesville.

In the hours before landfall, officials had warned that the hurricane could cause catastrophic damage and advised residents to take all possible precautions.

""This is a life-threatening storm,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said during a news conference on Friday morning. ""If you are in an evacuation zone, you need to get out now.""

The storm surge along the coast was expected to reach up to 13 feet in some areas, and heavy rainfall was expected to cause widespread flooding.

As the storm moved inland, it weakened, with maximum sustained winds decreasing to 85 mph by the time it reached Tallahassee, located about 100 miles northeast of where it made landfall.

Although the weakened hurricane no longer posed a direct threat to residents, officials warned that the storm's effects could still be felt for days.

""We are still monitoring the situation and urging everyone to stay vigilant,"" DeSantis said.

Related: Hurricane Ian causes widespread damage in Florida

The aftermath of the storm left residents scrambling to assess the damage and begin the process of cleaning up.

""We were lucky to have prepared as much as we did, but it is still overwhelming to see the damage,"" said Tallahassee resident Amy Johnson.

Across the state, residents reported downed power lines and flooded homes, and emergency crews were working around the clock to clear debris and restore power to affected areas.

The storm was the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Hurricane Michael in 2018, which caused widespread devastation and left more than 40 people dead.

Officials say that the extent of the damage caused by Ian is still unknown, and that it may take days or even weeks to fully assess the impact.

""We are still in the early stages of recovery, and our priority right now is to ensure the safety and well-being of our residents,"" said DeSantis.

Residents are urged to remain vigilant and heed all warnings from local officials as the recovery efforts continue.

In the wake of the damage caused by Hurricane Ian, officials are calling for increased efforts to mitigate the impact of future storms.

""Ian is yet another reminder of the need for increased investments in our infrastructure and disaster preparedness,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio.

Florida is no stranger to the destructive power of hurricanes, and officials have redoubled efforts in recent years to prepare for such storms.

""This is a wake-up call for all of us,"" said DeSantis. ""We need to take action now to ensure that our state is better prepared for these types of events in the future.""

As recovery efforts continue, residents in affected areas are reminded that they are not alone in their struggle.

""We will get through this together,"" DeSantis said. ""Florida is strong, and we will bounce back from this storm.""",1
230,Buenos Aires airport turns into unofficial homeless shelter,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - For many travelers, arriving at an airport can be a stressful experience, but for some in Buenos Aires, it has become a place of refuge.

With no official shelter available, the capital's international airport and its surroundings have become a makeshift home for those without a roof over their heads.  

The situation has become so acute that the airport's management is now appealing to the authorities to step in and provide much-needed aid.

The airport is located in the city's outskirts, in a working-class neighborhood, with very few services around. The location and the fact that the airport is open 24 hours a day have made it a target for homeless people looking for a place to stay.

Over the years, the number of people sleeping in and around the airport has grown, and today it is estimated that around 300 people call this place home. 

Many of them live in makeshift tents, others on cardboard boxes or plastic chairs. They cook their food on small gas stoves or in makeshift barbecues made of old cans. 

For some, the airport has become a refuge after suffering a family breakdown or losing their jobs, while for others, it is a dangerous stop on their way to a better future.

Pablo, a 45-year-old man who declined to give his last name, has been living at the airport for the past year. He left his home in Salta, a northern province of Argentina, after losing his job and getting divorced. 

""I decided to come to Buenos Aires thinking that I would find a job and start again, but it didn't work out that way,"" he said.

Pablo said that he slept on the streets for a while, until he learned about the airport's ""living conditions"". He now works as a security guard for a private company and receives a salary of around $200 a month. 

Others are not as lucky as Pablo. Many rely on hand-outs from other homeless people or the generosity of airport workers.

For airport authorities, the situation has become unsustainable. The growing number of tents and people living in unhygienic conditions not only presents a danger to their health but also poses a security risk.

""There are fights, knife fights, and thievery going on,"" said airport operations manager Miguel Díaz. ""We have to deal with alcoholism and drug addiction. It's a very serious problem.""

Airport authorities have reached out to the municipal government of Buenos Aires seeking help, but so far there has been no formal response. 

The airport's management, aware that the problem is not going to go away anytime soon, has appealed to the authorities to provide a permanent shelter for the homeless people.

""We know that this is not the solution, but it's a first step. We need to create a place where these people can live with dignity, receive medical care, and have access to basic services,"" airport director Martín Eurnekian said.

Some local authorities have suggested that the city's government should take over an abandoned hotel located a few blocks away from the airport and turn it into a homeless shelter. However, the proposal is yet to be formally considered.

In the meantime, the airport is doing what it can to help. A local NGO has set up a mobile unit providing medical care, and the airport's management has installed portable toilets and is providing drinking water. 

Airport workers have also responded by showing their support for the homeless people. They donate food, clothes, and blankets, and in some cases, even provide them with jobs.

However, as kind as their gestures may be, they do not solve the underlying problem. The homeless people at the airport need a permanent solution to their situation and, until then, they will continue to occupy a space that should be reserved for passengers and visitors.

For those who live at the airport, the hope is that the authorities will recognize their plight and take action soon. 

""We don't want to be here. We want to have a home, a job, and a future,"" said Pablo. 

Until a permanent shelter is provided, the travelers arriving at Ezeiza, Buenos Aires' main international airport, will continue to be greeted by an array of tents and makeshift shelters, a sight that could only be found in one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.",1
231,Red Bulls' Vanzeir suspended 6 games for racist language,"New York Red Bulls forward, Theo Vanzeir, has been suspended for six games for using racist language during a recent match against FC Cincinnati. The suspension came after an investigation by Major League Soccer (MLS), which found that Vanzeir had used derogatory and offensive racial remarks towards an opponent.

The incident occurred during the 68th minute of the match when Vanzeir was involved in a confrontation with FC Cincinnati defender, Anton Walkes. Vanzeir was heard using language which was deemed to be racist towards Walkes, who is of African American descent.

After the match, Walkes made a complaint to the match officials, who subsequently reported the incident to MLS. The league then launched an investigation, which included interviews with players, coaches and match officials. The investigation concluded that Vanzeir had used language that was offensive and violated MLS’ policy on discrimination and respect.

The suspension means that Vanzeir will miss the next six games for the Red Bulls, including an important matchup against Eastern Conference rivals, Atlanta United. In addition to the suspension, Vanzeir has also been ordered to complete a mandatory education program on discrimination and inclusivity.

In a statement, the Red Bulls expressed their disappointment with Vanzeir’s actions and reaffirmed their commitment to equality and respect for all. The club also apologized to FC Cincinnati and Anton Walkes for the incident.

This incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing scourge of racism in sports and society at large. MLS and other sports leagues must continue to take strong action against discrimination to ensure that everyone can participate and compete in a fair and respectful environment.",1
232,China warns of rocket debris in area northeast of Taiwan,"China’s space agency has warned that debris from its Long March 5B rocket is expected to fall back to Earth in an area northeast of Taiwan. The news has sparked concerns over the safety of people in the region, including those traveling by air or living in the projected landing zone.

The Chinese spacecraft was launched on April 29, carrying the core module for the country's new orbital station. The rocket is now in an uncontrolled orbit and its remnants are likely to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in the next few days.

China has been criticized in the past for its handling of space debris, particularly for leaving dangerous objects in orbit. In 2018, the Chinese Tiangong-1 space station crashed into the Pacific Ocean after months of uncertainty over where it would fall.

Scientists say that the size of the rocket debris makes it unlikely to pose a threat to people on the ground, but the potential danger to airlines and shipping is significant. Chinese authorities have not provided a timeline for when the debris is likely to land.

The U.S. Department of Defense is tracking the rocket debris, but it is unclear whether the United States or other nations will take action to prevent it from crashing onto their territory.

This latest incident highlights the growing problem of space debris, which is becoming increasingly concerning as the number of satellites and other objects in orbit continues to grow. Scientists warn that if the situation is not managed properly, space debris could become a serious threat to space exploration and commercial activities.

China has not yet commented on its plans for handling the debris, but its space agency has assured the public that it is monitoring the situation closely and will inform the public of any further developments.",1
233,France's Macron to draft bill legalizing end-of-life options,"French President Emmanuel Macron has announced his intention to draft a new bill that would legalize end-of-life options for patients who are terminally ill. The move is part of Macron's efforts to promote a more compassionate approach to healthcare, and it is expected to spark a debate over the ethics of assisted suicide.

At present, assisted suicide is still illegal in France, although euthanasia has been legalized in certain neighboring countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands. Under the proposed legislation, patients with terminal illnesses could request assistance in ending their lives after consulting with their doctors, and the process would be rigorously monitored to ensure that it is carried out ethically.

Macron's decision was welcomed by several patient advocacy groups and medical associations, who argued that the current legal framework for end-of-life care was overly restrictive and sometimes forced patients to suffer needlessly. The proposed legislation offers a more humane approach, they argue, and could provide comfort to patients who are facing unbearable pain and suffering.

However, opponents of the bill argue that it is inherently dangerous and violates the Hippocratic Oath, which forbids physicians from intentionally causing harm to their patients. They also point out that the legalization of assisted suicide could lead to abuses and exacerbate existing inequalities in the healthcare system.

Others argue that the bill does not go far enough in promoting a truly compassionate approach to end-of-life care. They argue that a more comprehensive approach is needed, which would prioritize palliative care, pain management, and support for patients and families, rather than just offering a limited option for patients who are considering assisted suicide.

Despite these concerns, Macron has expressed confidence that the bill will move forward, citing public opinion polls that show widespread support for the legalization of assisted suicide. He has also noted that other countries have successfully implemented similar legislation without any significant negative consequences.

The bill is expected to face stiff opposition from some quarters, especially from religious groups and social conservatives who argue that assisted suicide is morally and ethically wrong. However, Macron has made it clear that he believes the end-of-life options bill is necessary to provide compassionate care for patients who are facing the end of their lives.

Overall, the debate around assisted suicide is likely to continue, both in France and around the world. As the population ages and healthcare costs continue to rise, more and more patients will be forced to confront difficult decisions about end-of-life care. Whether or not the French government's proposed legislation is the right solution remains to be seen, but it is clear that this is an issue that will continue to be at the forefront of public discussion for years to come.",1
234,Robotic dog rejoins New York police,"NEW YORK – After a year-long hiatus, a robotic dog has rejoined the New York Police Department (NYPD) to help its officers with public safety and security efforts.

The robotic canine, known as “Digidog,” was initially deployed by the NYPD in December 2019, but it was recalled after it drew controversy among civil liberties activists, who likened it to a dystopian surveillance tool.

However, the NYPD recently confirmed that Digidog is now back in service and is undergoing testing in select areas of the city.

“Digidog is finally back on the streets, and we’re excited about the potential it could bring to our policing efforts,” an NYPD spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re confident that this technology will help our officers keep New Yorkers safe.”

The robot dog, which is manufactured by Boston Dynamics, is equipped with cameras and sensors that can capture and gather data in real-time, giving the police a 360-degree view of an area. It can also be remotely controlled by an officer and can traverse terrains that might be difficult for humans to access.

The NYPD has not disclosed how many Digidogs it has or where they will be deployed. However, the department emphasized that it would ensure the appropriate use of the robot dogs and that they would not replace human officers but rather assist them.

“We’ll be carefully monitoring how this technology performs and will be transparent about its uses within policing,” the spokesperson said. “We understand the concerns raised by some of our communities, and we’re committed to protecting civil liberties while also keeping our city safe.”

Still, the return of Digidog has reignited some of the criticism that it initially attracted. Civil liberties groups have expressed concerns about potential privacy violations and the use of the technology for unchecked surveillance. They have also argued that the use of the robot dog could exacerbate police militarization and contribute to the further erosion of trust between the police and the public.

“People in New York should be able to walk down the street without being worried that some robot is following them or that their every move is being tracked by the NYPD,” said Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “We don’t need more gimmicks in policing. We need more accountability, transparency, and respect for basic human dignity and rights.”

The debate over Digidog, and the use of robotics in policing in general, is likely to continue, with some advocating for more stringent regulations on surveillance technology and others calling for a complete ban on their use. The NYPD’s decision to deploy Digidog is indicative of the growing reliance on technology in law enforcement and highlights the need for a robust and ongoing discussion about the ethical implications of these developments.",1
235,"For BLM's Patrisse Cullors, art is both vocation and salvation","Patrisse Cullors, the co-founder of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, has found solace and inspiration in art throughout her life. Cullors, who is also an artist, writer, and organizer, believes that art can be a powerful tool for change and communication. In an interview with AP News, she spoke about her passion for art and how it has influenced her activism.

Cullors grew up in Los Angeles, which had a vibrant artistic community that she was exposed to at a young age. Her mother was an artist, and Cullors recalls spending most of her childhood in her mother's studio. She was drawn to various forms of art, ranging from graffiti to poetry, and it became a way for her to express herself. As a teenager, she began getting involved in community organizing and activism, which she saw as a natural extension of her artistic passions.

Cullors eventually went to college, where she continued to explore her interests in art and activism. She enrolled in a program called Social and Cultural Analysis at New York University, which allowed her to combine her passions by studying how art can be a tool for social change. It was during this time that she began to see the power of art in shaping political discourse.

For Cullors, art is not just a form of expression but also a tool for liberation. She believes that art has the power to change hearts and minds and to communicate important messages that can be difficult to convey through traditional means. This is why she has always incorporated art into her activism, whether it's by creating powerful visuals for protest signs or writing poetry that speaks to the experiences of marginalized communities.

One of Cullors' most well-known artistic endeavors is her book, ""When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir."" The book, which she co-wrote with asha bandele, is a powerful reflection on her life and activism. It explores the ways in which she has been shaped by her experiences as a Black woman and the role that art has played in her journey. The book has become a best-seller and has been praised for its raw honesty and unflinching examination of systemic racism in America.

In addition to her writing, Cullors has also been involved in visual art projects. She has worked with the artist Damon Davis on a project called ""Hands Up,"" which features portraits of Black people who have been killed by police. The project has been displayed in various locations around the country, and it serves as a powerful reminder of the toll that police brutality has taken on Black communities.

Cullors has also been involved in other visual art projects that explore issues of race and inequality. For example, she collaborated with the artist Molly Crabapple on a video for the song ""We Want Freedom"" by the musician Talib Kweli. The video is a poignant representation of the struggles faced by Black people in America, and it features powerful images and lyrics that speak to the urgency of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Cullors' art is not just a reflection of her activism; it's also a form of self-care. She sees art as a source of healing and inspiration, and she encourages others to use it as a way to cope with trauma and stress. This is especially important for Black people, who are often subjected to institutionalized racism and violence. Cullors believes that art can provide a sense of empowerment and resilience in the face of adversity.

In the interview with AP News, Cullors also spoke about the ways in which the BLM movement has been shaped by art. She discussed the murals that have been painted in cities around the world in honor of George Floyd and other victims of police brutality. She also talked about the importance of music and poetry in the movement, citing the powerful performances by poets like Aja Monet and Danez Smith.

Cullors believes that art can play a central role in shaping the future of the BLM movement. She sees it as a way to amplify voices that have traditionally been silenced and to create a sense of unity and solidarity among Black people around the world. She wants to see more Black artists and creatives getting involved in the movement, using their talents to help bring about real change.

For Cullors, art is both a vocation and a salvation. It has been a constant presence in her life, and it has shaped the way she sees the world. Her passion for art has fueled her activism, and it has helped her to connect with others who share her vision. As the BLM movement continues to gain momentum, it's clear that art will play a crucial role in shaping its future.",1
236,Second expelled Black Democrat reinstated to Tennessee House,"In a landmark decision, the Tennessee House of Representatives has reinstated lawmaker Rep. London Lamar (D), who had been expelled earlier this year. The move comes just two months after Rep. John DeBerry (D) was also reinstated, marking a significant shift in the state's political landscape.

Lamar, who represents the 91st District in Memphis, was expelled from the House in March for ""disorderly conduct"" after she allegedly made ""inappropriate and disrespectful"" comments about her colleagues. However, her supporters argued that her remarks were taken out of context and that she had been unfairly targeted because of her race.

In a statement following her reinstatement, Lamar thanked her supporters and vowed to continue fighting for her constituents. ""I'm grateful to my colleagues for recognizing the unfairness of my expulsion and for giving me a second chance to serve the people of Memphis,"" she said. ""I will continue to fight for justice and equality for all Tennesseans, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance policies that uplift our communities.""

The decision to reinstate Lamar was not without controversy, however. Some lawmakers argued that her expulsion had been necessary to maintain decorum and professionalism in the House. ""We cannot have a member of this body making derogatory and inflammatory remarks about other members,"" said Rep. William Lamberth (R).

Others, however, saw Lamar's expulsion as part of a broader pattern of discrimination against Black lawmakers in Tennessee. ""This is a clear case of racism and sexism in action,"" said Rep. Karen Camper (D), who serves as the House Minority Leader. ""We cannot continue to ignore the systemic injustices that are keeping Black people and other marginalized communities out of positions of power.""

Indeed, the reinstatement of both Lamar and DeBerry has highlighted an ongoing struggle within the Tennessee Democratic Party over the role of Black lawmakers. For years, Black Democrats have complained of being marginalized and silenced by the party establishment, which they say is dominated by white, centrist leaders who are out of touch with the needs of their constituents.

This tension came to a head earlier this year when the Democratic caucus voted to expel DeBerry, a veteran lawmaker who had represented his Memphis district for more than 20 years. DeBerry, who is known for his conservative views on issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, had been criticized by some members of the party for not toeing the progressive line on these and other issues.

Many Black Democrats, however, defended DeBerry, arguing that he was one of the few lawmakers who truly understood the needs and concerns of his predominantly Black and working-class district. ""John DeBerry is not a Republican in Democratic clothing,"" said Rep. Antonio Parkinson (D) at the time. ""He is a Democrat who has fought for his constituents and his community for over 20 years.""

The decision to expel DeBerry caused an uproar among many of his supporters and exposed deep fault lines within the party. Some progressive groups praised the move as a necessary step towards purging the party of conservative elements, while others accused the leadership of abandoning its core principles of inclusion and diversity.

In the end, DeBerry was reinstated by a panel of judges who ruled that his expulsion violated the Tennessee Constitution. The decision was seen as a rebuke to the party establishment and a victory for Black Democrats who had been fighting for greater representation and autonomy within the party.

The reinstatements of Lamar and DeBerry are likely to have significant implications for Tennessee politics, particularly as the state heads into a critical election year. Democrats are hoping to make gains in the state legislature and perhaps even win the governor's mansion, which has been held by Republicans since 2010.

However, the party will need to navigate the complex and often fractious dynamics between its progressive and conservative wings, particularly as it seeks to appeal to a diverse and increasingly politically engaged electorate. With the reinstatement of Lamar and DeBerry, the party has signaled that it is willing to embrace a more inclusive and diverse vision for the future, one that can unite Black and white Democrats behind a common agenda.

In conclusion, the reinstatement of London Lamar and John DeBerry to the Tennessee House of Representatives marks a significant moment in the state's political history, and highlights the ongoing struggle for representation and inclusion among Black Democrats. As the state heads into a pivotal election year, the party must navigate complex and often contentious dynamics between its progressive and conservative wings, while also working to build a broad-based coalition that can deliver meaningful change for all Tennesseans.",1
237,Woman tied to Arizona polygamous leader accused of threats,"PHOENIX (AP) — A woman tied to a polygamous group in Arizona has been accused of making threats against others.

Court documents say 45-year-old Felicia Rohrer was arrested last week and charged with three felony counts of intimidation and three misdemeanor counts of criminal damage.

According to the documents, Rohrer is tied to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which has been based in the border town of Colorado City for decades.

The church's leader, Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered brides.

Rohrer is accused of making threats against a former church member and two of their acquaintances. The threats allegedly included telling the former church member that she would ""pay for her sins"" and that ""judgment day is coming.""

In addition to the threats, Rohrer is accused of causing damage to the former church member's vehicle and property.

Rohrer is being held on a $50,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court later this week.

The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has been the subject of numerous investigations and prosecutions over the years. The group practices polygamy, and many of its members are related through marriage.

Critics have accused the group of engaging in forced marriages and child abuse. The group's practices have been denounced by the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which split from the fundamentalist group more than a century ago.

In recent years, there has been a push to reform the polygamous communities in Arizona and Utah.

In 2018, a federal jury found four members of the Arizona-based FLDS guilty of food stamp fraud and money laundering. The men, including Jeffs' brother, were accused of funneling millions of dollars in government benefits to the church's coffers.

The case was seen as a major victory for law enforcement officials and advocates who have been working for years to crack down on the polygamous groups.

Last year, Arizona lawmakers passed a bill aimed at cracking down on child sex trafficking and abuse in polygamous communities. The bill increased penalties for crimes committed in the context of polygamy and established a task force to investigate such crimes.

Despite the efforts to reform the polygamous communities, cases like Rohrer's demonstrate that the groups still pose a significant threat to their members and the wider community.

The allegations against Rohrer are a reminder that even if the leaders of these groups are in prison, the influence of their beliefs and practices still lingers.

As we work to hold individuals accountable for their crimes, we must also continue to work towards creating a culture that does not tolerate the abuses perpetuated by these groups. Only then will we truly be able to bring an end to the harm caused by polygamous communities.",1
238,Ukraine's outrage grows over video seeming to show beheading,"KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — A video that appeared to show the beheading of a Ukrainian citizen has sparked outrage in Ukraine, with the government calling for an immediate investigation into the matter.

The video, which appears to show the beheading of a Ukrainian man by a group of men dressed in black, was first posted on social media on Monday. The violent footage quickly went viral and has been widely shared on the internet.

The victim in the video has been identified as 29-year-old Ihor Hryb, a Ukrainian national. According to his father, Hryb went missing in Belarus in August 2017 and was never seen again.

The video has left many Ukrainians feeling shocked and deeply disturbed. It has also reignited tensions between Ukraine and Russia, with many speculating that the group responsible for Hryb's death may have ties to the Russian government.

The Ukrainian government has condemned the video and called for an immediate investigation into the matter. In a statement released on Tuesday, the government expressed its ""outrage and deep concern"" over the incident and promised to do ""everything in its power"" to bring those responsible to justice.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his condolences to Hryb's family and pledged to do ""everything possible"" to ensure that justice is served.

""We condemn this brutal and seemingly senseless act of violence in the strongest possible terms,"" said Zelensky. ""We will not rest until those responsible for this heinous crime are brought to justice.""

Many in Ukraine believe that the group responsible for Hryb's death may have ties to the Russian government, which has been accused of fomenting unrest in Ukraine and supporting separatist groups in the country's eastern regions.

The Russian government has denied involvement in the incident, calling it ""baseless and unfounded."" However, many in Ukraine remain skeptical of Russia's claims, given its history of meddling in Ukraine's affairs.

The incident has also raised concerns about the safety of Ukrainian citizens in neighboring countries. Ukraine has been locked in a bitter conflict with Russia since 2014, and tensions between the two nations have remained high ever since.

In recent years, a number of Ukrainian nationals have been abducted or arrested in Russia and other neighboring countries. Many believe that these incidents are part of a broader strategy by Russia to intimidate and silence Ukrainian dissidents.

The Ukrainian government has vowed to take steps to ensure the safety of its citizens abroad. In a statement released on Tuesday, the government called upon other countries to ""respect the rights and freedoms of Ukrainian citizens"" and to ""take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of Ukrainians abroad.""

The video has also reignited debate over the use of social media to spread violent and extremist content. The footage was first posted on Telegram, a popular messaging app that has been criticized in the past for allowing extremist groups to disseminate their messages.

Many in Ukraine are calling for stricter regulation of social media platforms, in order to prevent the spread of violent and extremist content. The Ukrainian government has vowed to take steps to address this issue, and has called upon other countries to follow suit.

The incident has also drawn attention to the issue of human rights abuses in Ukraine. Amnesty International has expressed concern about the safety of Ukrainian nationals in neighboring countries and called upon the Ukrainian government to do more to protect the rights of its citizens.

""The Ukrainian government must ensure that its citizens are protected from harm, both at home and abroad,"" said Denis Krivosheev, Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International. ""This incident highlights the need for greater vigilance in protecting the rights of Ukrainian nationals, particularly those who are at risk of being targeted because of their political or social views.""

As the investigation into Hryb's death continues, many in Ukraine are left wondering how such a brutal and senseless act could have occurred. The incident has left a deep scar on the Ukrainian psyche, and has served as a stark reminder of the dangers facing Ukrainian citizens both at home and abroad. 

In the words of Ukrainian President Zelensky, ""We will not tolerate violence and extremism, and we will take all necessary measures to ensure justice and safety for our citizens.""",1
239,US urges meat companies to ensure they don't use child labor,"The US government has called on meat companies to ensure that they are not using child labor in their supply chains. The move follows concerns that some companies may be relying on underage workers to process meat and other meat products.

The US Department of Labor, in a statement issued on Wednesday, said that it was ""deeply concerned"" about reports of child labor in the meat industry. The Department urged companies to conduct thorough checks of their supply chains to ensure that they are not employing underage workers.

""We expect meat companies to put in place rigorous due diligence procedures to ensure that they are not using child labor in their supply chains,"" said a spokesperson for the Department. ""Any company found to be using child labor will be held accountable and face legal action.""

The use of child labor in the meat industry is a long-standing problem, with children often being employed to perform dangerous and difficult tasks in abattoirs and other meat processing facilities. In some cases, children are trafficked across borders to work in the industry.

The Department of Labor's call comes as part of a wider push to clamp down on the use of child labor in all sectors of the US economy. Last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at improving the protection of workers' rights, including those of children.

The order seeks to tackle a range of labor abuses, including wage theft, discrimination, and unsafe working conditions. It also calls for increased enforcement of labor laws and greater cooperation between US government agencies, industry groups, and civil society organizations.

""This executive order sends a clear message that the Biden administration is committed to protecting workers' rights and preventing labor abuses of all kinds,"" said Labor Secretary Marty Walsh.

The US Department of Labor has urged companies to take immediate action to ensure that they are not using child labor in their supply chains. Companies are also being encouraged to work with civil society organizations and other stakeholders to improve labor standards and promote worker rights.

""Child labor has no place in the modern world, and we must do everything in our power to stamp it out,"" said the Department of Labor spokesperson. ""By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for all workers.""",1
240,Brittney Griner makes appearance at Rev. Al Sharpton event,"Brittney Griner, a standout in the WNBA, made an appearance at the National Action Network's convention on Wednesday, hosted by Rev. Al Sharpton. Griner has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights and joined Sharpton on stage to discuss the intersectionality of race, sexuality and gender in athletics.

During the conversation, Griner emphasized the importance of athletes using their platforms to bring attention to social justice issues. ""I have a big platform and I'm going to use it,"" she said. Griner, who is openly gay, spoke about the challenges she faces as a queer athlete and the need for more representation and acceptance in sports.

Sharpton praised Griner for her courage in speaking out and for being a positive role model for young people. ""We need more athletes like Brittney Griner, who are unafraid to speak truth to power,"" he said.

Griner, who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, has been a dominant force in the league since being drafted in 2013. In addition to her on-court success, she has also been a leader in the fight for LGBTQ rights and social justice. Her appearance at the National Action Network convention is just one example of her commitment to creating a more equitable world.",1
241,Takeaways of AP Investigation into deadly migrant voyage,"In October 2020, a wooden boat carrying over 200 migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea, leaving at least 74 people dead. This tragic incident was just one of many that occur regularly along the route from Libya and other North African countries to Europe. Despite the dangers, thousands of people continue to risk their lives each year in the hopes of finding safety and a better life across the sea.

A recent investigation by the Associated Press has shed new light on the conditions and motivations behind these deadly voyages. Here are some of the key takeaways from the investigation:

1. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the journey even more dangerous.

The pandemic has affected every aspect of life around the world, and the migrant routes across the Mediterranean are no exception. The AP found that some smugglers have taken advantage of the pandemic to cram even more people onto already overcrowded boats. This has made social distancing impossible and increased the risk of transmission of the virus. Additionally, lockdowns and travel restrictions have made it more difficult for aid organizations and rescue missions to operate, meaning that migrants are more isolated and vulnerable than ever before.

2. Migrants are often subjected to violence and abuse during their journey.

The journey across the Mediterranean is incredibly risky due to the dangerous waters and unpredictable weather conditions. However, this is not the only danger that migrants face. The AP investigation found that many migrants are subject to violence and abuse at the hands of smugglers and other criminals who prey on them. Some are held in squalid and overcrowded conditions for weeks or months before being put on a boat, while others are forced to endure beatings, sexual assault, and other forms of mistreatment. This highlights the urgent need for greater protection for migrants throughout the journey, as well as better support for survivors of trauma.

3. Many migrants are driven to take the risk by desperate circumstances.

The majority of people who attempt the journey across the Mediterranean are doing so out of sheer desperation. Many come from war-torn countries such as Syria or Somalia, while others are fleeing poverty, persecution, or other forms of hardship. The AP found that some migrants had sold everything they owned, including their homes and businesses, to pay for the journey. For them, the risks of being sent back to their home countries or living in refugee camps with little hope of a better future outweighed the dangers of the sea.

4. The crackdown on migration by European authorities is pushing more people into the hands of smugglers.

In recent years, European governments have implemented increasingly restrictive immigration policies in an attempt to deter people from attempting the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean. However, the AP investigation found that these policies have had the opposite effect, pushing more people into the hands of smugglers who operate outside of the law. With legal routes to Europe all but closed off, many migrants have no choice but to rely on smugglers who offer a chance at a better life, albeit at a steep cost.

5. The lack of international cooperation is exacerbating the crisis.

The migrant crisis in the Mediterranean is a complex and multi-faceted problem that cannot be solved by any one country or organization alone. However, the AP found that international cooperation on the issue is sorely lacking. Countries have been slow to provide resources and support for rescue missions and aid organizations, and disagreements over how to handle the crisis have led to gridlock at the United Nations and other international bodies. Without greater cooperation and a shared commitment to protecting vulnerable migrants, the crisis is likely to continue unchecked.

In conclusion, the AP investigation into the deadly migrant voyage has highlighted the urgent need for greater attention and action on this pressing issue. While the reasons behind the crisis are complex and multi-faceted, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect and support the migrants who risk their lives for a chance at a better future. This includes increased resources for aid organizations and rescue missions, greater legal pathways for migration, and a renewed commitment to global cooperation on the issue. Only by working together can we address this crisis and ensure a brighter future for all people.",1
242,Biden says tech companies must ensure AI products are safe,"President Joe Biden has called on technology companies to ensure that their artificial intelligence (AI) products are safe and transparent.

In a speech at the White House, Biden said that AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare to transportation. However, he warned that there are also risks that must be addressed.

""It's not just about what AI can do, it's about what it will do, and whether it will be used for good or for ill,"" Biden said.

The president expressed concern that AI could perpetuate biases and discrimination, and called on companies to be transparent about how their algorithms are being developed and used.

""We need to ensure that our AI systems are transparent, accountable, and subject to robust oversight,"" he said.

Biden's comments come as tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over their use of AI. There have been concerns that some algorithms are perpetuating racial or gender biases, or that they are being used to facilitate surveillance or censorship.

Earlier this year, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a warning to companies that use AI, saying that they must be transparent about how their algorithms are being used and ensure that they are not perpetuating biases or engaging in discriminatory practices.

In his speech, Biden also called on Congress to pass legislation that would regulate the use of AI. He said that any regulation must be balanced, preserving innovation while also protecting consumers and workers.

""We need to ensure that our laws keep pace with this technology, and that they protect the public interest,"" he said.

The president's comments were welcomed by some tech industry leaders, who have been calling for increased oversight of AI.

""Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform our society, but we need to ensure that it is used responsibly and ethically,"" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet. ""We welcome President Biden's call for transparency and accountability in AI and look forward to working with policymakers on this important issue.""

However, others expressed concern that increased regulation could stifle innovation and prevent companies from developing new technologies.

""AI is a rapidly evolving field, and it would be a shame to hamper its progress by imposing onerous regulations,"" said Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. ""We need to find a way to balance innovation with appropriate oversight.""

Overall, Biden's call for increased transparency and regulation of AI is likely to spark further debate about how best to ensure that this powerful technology is used in a way that benefits society as a whole.",1
243,Chocolate maker ignored natural gas alert before blast,"A chocolate factory in Illinois ignored a natural gas alert before a massive explosion rocked the plant, killing three people.

The blast occurred at the Loy-Lange Box Company in St. Louis on April 3, 2017, and sent a ball of fire shooting into the sky, damaging several buildings in the area. Three people were killed and several others were injured in the explosion, according to local authorities.

Now, a new report from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) claims that a contractor working for the candy maker, Hershey's, had alerted the company about the potential for a gas buildup in the factory weeks before the explosion, but the warning went unheeded.

According to the report, the contractor discovered elevated levels of natural gas in the factory on three separate occasions, but the plant managers failed to take any corrective action. In fact, the company continued to use a gas-fired oven in the factory even after being warned about the potential danger.

""Despite evidence that significant amounts of natural gas were present in the facility, Hershey failed to take the necessary steps to mitigate the risk of an explosion,"" said Vanessa Allen Sutherland, the chair of the CSB.

Hershey's has not commented on the report, but in a statement released after the explosion, the company expressed its ""deepest sympathies"" to those affected by the tragedy and said it was ""working closely with local authorities to determine the cause of the incident.""

The CSB report also highlights several other factors that contributed to the explosion, including inadequate training for employees, poor communication between contractors and plant managers, and a lack of oversight by federal agencies.

The explosion has raised concerns about the safety of other candy factories across the country, particularly those that use gas-fired ovens. According to the CSB, these ovens pose a significant risk of explosion if not properly maintained or operated.

The Loy-Lange Box Company was a family-owned business that had been in operation for over a century before the explosion. The facility produced cardboard boxes for a variety of industries, including Hershey's and other candy makers.

The tragedy has had a profound impact on the local community, with many residents still struggling to come to terms with the loss of life and property damage caused by the explosion.

""This was a preventable tragedy that could have been avoided if the companies involved had taken the necessary steps to ensure the safety of their employees and the community,"" said Sutherland. ""We hope that this report will serve as a wake-up call for other businesses to take their responsibility for safety seriously.""",1

245,"Ukraine, Romania, Moldova boost ties at security meeting","KIEV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova have pledged to strengthen their cooperation on security issues as tensions with Russia continue to simmer in the region.

At a joint meeting on Monday in Kiev, the defense ministers of the three countries discussed matters of defense, intelligence, and border control. The meeting was aimed at improving their ability to track and counter possible threats from Russia, which seized Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has been supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine throughout the conflict.

""The security of our countries is closely linked,"" said Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksandr Turchynov after the meeting. ""We have a common goal — to ensure peace and stability in the region.""

Moldova's defense minister, Eugen Sturza, agreed, adding that ""we are aware of the challenges we face and the risks we share. We must act together in order to better address them"".

Romania is a member of NATO and has been boosting its defense spending in recent years due to concerns over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Moldova is not a member of NATO but has been seeking closer ties with the alliance. Ukraine, meanwhile, is not a NATO member, but is viewed as a key ally by the United States and many EU countries.

During Monday's talks, the three countries also discussed plans to cooperate on military training and intelligence sharing. The defense ministers signed a joint statement pledging to deepen their cooperation.

The meeting comes as tensions between Russia and the West continue to simmer over issues including Ukraine, Syria, and alleged interference in Western elections. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned Romania's plans to modernize its military and raise its defense budget, calling them ""aggressive"" and ""unreasonable"".

Despite the tensions, the three countries involved in Monday's meeting expressed a commitment to working together for the sake of regional security.

""We are committed to collaborating and to strengthen our cooperation,"" said Romanian Defense Minister Mihnea Motoc. ""Our nations' security is essential for the prosperity and stability of the region.""",1
246,Tribes want US protection for areas next to the Grand Canyon,"FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — A coalition of 11 Native American tribes is calling for protections for land next to the Grand Canyon, saying that increased mining activity could contaminate the Colorado River — a major source of water for the Southwest.

The tribes met with federal officials in October to discuss a mineral withdrawal that would effectively ban new mining claims on approximately 1 million acres of public lands for 20 years. The proposal has garnered support from the Interior Department but remains in the early stages of the federal rule-making process.

The tribes — which include the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe and Hualapai Tribe — say the measure would safeguard not only the river but sacred sites and the region's more than $1 billion tourism industry.

“We’re not talking about a toilet. We’re talking about the lifeblood of Mother Earth,” Tonto Apache Tribe Chairman Calvin Johnson said during the meeting.

The potential mineral withdrawal comes as the Trump administration promotes energy development on public lands and rolls back protections for areas considered pristine. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt has traveled to Arizona and other Western states to tout uranium mining as an important part of national security, despite opposition from a wide range of groups, including environmentalists and local governments.

The Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group and member of the coalition, argues that mining outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park would destroy important wildlife habitat, pollute the skies with dust and soot and remove resources from the public domain.

Federal agencies have been considering the withdrawal for years, prompted by concerns from environmentalists and tribes about mining threats to the Grand Canyon watershed. Previous Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had imposed a two-year mining halt on the region in 2012, but that was overturned by a federal judge three years later.

Some local officials have argued that a mineral withdrawal would further limit economic growth in a rural and deeply impoverished part of the state. Mohave County Supervisor Buster Johnson said he worries about the economic impacts of taking valuable minerals off the table, though he said he has not read the latest proposal.

“I want to see what they’re actually talking about,” he said.

The tribes have asked for a 20-year withdrawal of approximately 1 million acres of public lands near the Grand Canyon in Northern Arizona. The moratorium would apply to new mining claims, but not to existing mines, prospecting, or mining on private or state lands.

In addition to protecting the Grand Canyon watershed, the withdrawal would safeguard Native American ancestral sites and protect irreplaceable cultural resources. It would also allow the tribes to continue their traditional economic activities such as hunting, gathering, and cultural restoration.

The Interior Department plans to hold a series of public meetings in early 2020 to gather public input on the proposal. A final decision is expected by year-end.",1
247,Idaho jurors see graphic photos of slain kids in mom's trial,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) - Jurors in Idaho were shown graphic photos of two young siblings who were found murdered in their family home during the trial of their mother.

The trial of Sarah Blake, 34, began on Monday in Ada County District Court in Boise. Blake has pleaded not guilty to the first-degree murder of her two children, 7-year-old Cody and 5-year-old Kiera.

The prosecution claims that Blake killed the children in a fit of rage after an argument with her husband, who was out of town at the time. The defense argues that Blake was suffering from a mental illness and was not in control of her actions.

During the opening statements, prosecutor Jean Fisher warned the jurors that the photos they were about to see were graphic and disturbing, but necessary to show the brutality of the crime. She said the photos depicted the children lying lifeless in their beds, covered in blood.

Some jurors covered their faces with their hands as the photos were shown, while others looked away. Blake, who was sitting at the defense table, didn't appear to react to the photos.

The prosecution then called the first witness to the stand, Blake's neighbor, who said she heard a loud argument coming from the Blake home on the night of the murders. She said she heard Blake yelling at the children and then heard a thud. The neighbor went over to the house to check on the family but got no response.

The bodies of the children were discovered the next morning by Blake's husband when he returned home from his trip. He called 911.

The prosecution argued that Blake, who had a history of mental illness, had been neglectful and abusive towards her children in the months leading up to the murders. They said she was angry with her husband for leaving her alone with the children and took out her frustration on them.

The defense argued that Blake was suffering from postpartum depression and psychosis at the time of the murders. They said she was not in control of her actions and should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.

The trial is expected to last several weeks, and the jury will have to decide whether Blake is guilty of first-degree murder or not.

The case has attracted national attention and raised questions about the mental health of mothers who commit filicide, the killing of their own children. Data shows that women are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness than men, and postpartum depression and psychosis are common among new mothers.

According to the American Psychological Association, about one in 10 women in the US will experience postpartum depression or anxiety, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. In rare cases, postpartum psychosis can occur, which is a severe mental illness that requires immediate treatment.

The trial is being closely watched by mental health professionals who are concerned about the stigma that surrounds mental illness, especially in cases where a mother has killed her own children. They say that women who suffer from postpartum depression or psychosis need better support and treatment to prevent tragic outcomes.

Dr. Janet Johnson, a clinical psychologist who specializes in maternal mental health, said that mothers who commit filicide are often struggling with severe mental illness and need help, not punishment.

""It's tragic when a mother kills her own children, and it's easy to want to blame her and call her a monster,"" Johnson said. ""But the reality is that these women are often dealing with a mental illness that has gone untreated or ignored. We need to recognize that mental illness is a disease, not a moral failure.""

Johnson said that women who are at risk of postpartum depression or psychosis need more support from their healthcare providers, including screening for mental health issues during pregnancy and the postpartum period. She said that women who are struggling with mental illness should not fear seeking help, as treatment is available.

The trial is expected to continue this week, with testimony from witnesses and experts in maternal mental health. The jury will have to weigh the evidence and decide whether Blake is guilty of first-degree murder, or not guilty by reason of insanity.

248,White House wants rule to protect abortion patients' records,"Washington D.C. - The White House is urging the Department of Health and Human Services to implement a rule protecting the privacy of patients seeking abortions. The proposed rule would require healthcare providers to obtain written consent from patients before sharing any personal information related to their abortion procedures.

The proposed rule comes in the wake of recent state laws restricting access to abortion services, including the near-total ban on abortions passed in Alabama earlier this year. Supporters of the new rule say it is necessary to prevent patients from facing harassment or retaliation for seeking medical care.

""Patients should not have to fear for their privacy or safety when seeking reproductive health care,"" said Alma Hernandez, executive director of the National Association of Abortion Providers. ""This rule would help ensure that they are able to receive the care they need without fear of discrimination or harm.""

Opponents, however, argue that the new rule could undermine efforts to hold healthcare providers accountable for malpractice or other legal violations related to abortion procedures. Some anti-abortion groups have also expressed concern that the rule could be used to further entrench abortion rights and promote a ""culture of death.""

In a statement, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was ""reviewing comments on the proposed rule"" and would make a decision ""in due course."" The department did not provide a timeline for when that decision would be made.

The proposed rule has also drawn criticism from some privacy advocates, who argue that it could be used to further erode individuals' privacy rights. Some have pointed to recent scandals involving the misuse of patient data by healthcare providers as evidence that the proposed rule is unnecessary and could do more harm than good.

However, supporters of the rule say that it strikes a balance between protecting patients' privacy and ensuring that healthcare providers are held accountable for their actions. They argue that the rule would help to prevent instances of discrimination, harassment, or other mistreatment of patients seeking abortion services.

""At its core, this proposed rule is about equality and dignity for all patients seeking reproductive health care,"" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America. ""It's about ensuring that people can access the care they need without fear of being targeted or violated.""

The proposed rule comes amid a wider debate over abortion rights in the United States, with several states passing legislation that restricts access to abortion or outright bans the procedure. Advocates for reproductive rights have criticized these laws as an attack on women's healthcare and an infringement on their constitutional rights.

President Biden has vowed to protect access to abortion services and has called on Congress to codify the rights enshrined in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The White House's support for the proposed rule is seen as a sign of the administration's commitment to protecting reproductive rights.

""We cannot allow hard-won progress on reproductive health to be undermined by those who seek to undo it,"" said Vice President Kamala Harris in a recent speech. ""We must continue to fight for the right of every person to make their own healthcare decisions.""

The Department of Health and Human Services is expected to announce a decision on the proposed rule in the coming weeks. While it is unclear how the rule will be received by the healthcare industry, many advocates for reproductive rights are hailing it as a step in the right direction.

""As healthcare providers, we have a responsibility to protect our patients' privacy and ensure that they receive the care they need,"" said Hernandez. ""This proposed rule is a necessary step toward fulfilling that duty and ensuring that all patients are treated with respect and dignity.""",1
249,Guyana's Rupununi Rodeo celebrates local cowboy culture,"LARISSA, Guyana - Guyana's Rupununi region came alive recently as it hosted the Rupununi Rodeo, a celebration of cowboy culture that has become an annual tradition. The rodeo attracted both locals and visitors who came to witness the exciting event.

The rodeo features thrilling competitions such as bull riding, calf roping, and steer wrestling, as well as cultural displays, food, and music.

One of the highlights of the event was the bull riding competition, where cowboys had to stay on a bucking bull for eight seconds. The spectacle was truly breathtaking as the cowboys showed off their skills and bravery, while the crowds cheered them on.

Jasmine, a visitor from Canada, said she had never seen anything like it before. ""I've heard of rodeos before, but seeing it up close is something else. The atmosphere and energy are amazing,"" she said.

Apart from the rodeo competitions, the event also showcased the unique culture of the Rupununi region. The cultural displays included traditional dances and songs, as well as the display of local crafts.

The event emphasizes the importance of preserving and sharing the heritage of the Rupununi region. According to the organizers, the rodeo is a way to celebrate the traditions of the people of the region and to showcase their way of life.

In addition, the rodeo also provided an economic boost for the region as visitors came from all over the country to witness the spectacle. Local vendors sold food, drinks, and souvenirs, creating opportunities for small businesses to thrive.

The Rupununi Rodeo has become a source of pride for the people in the region, as well as a way to connect with the rest of the country. The event serves as a reminder of the rich cultural heritage that exists in Guyana, and the need to celebrate and preserve it.

As the Rupununi Rodeo drew to a close, the cowboys and their families left with a sense of achievement and satisfaction. Their love for their way of life and culture had been celebrated, and they could look forward to doing it all over again next year.",1
250,DOJ to ask Supreme Court to put abortion pill limits on hold,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Justice Department said Thursday that it will again go to the Supreme Court over abortion after a lower court ruling allowed the abortion pill mifepristone to remain available in the U. S. but reimposed past restrictions on getting and using the drug.

At stake in the accelerating court battle that began in Texas is widespread access to the most common method of abortion in the U. S., less than a year after the reversal of Roe v. Wade prompted more than a dozen states to effectively ban abortion outright.

In a ruling late Wednesday, the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans temporarily narrowed a ruling by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone. But a divided three-judge panel still reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be taken and said it could not be dispensed by mail.

The ruling preventing the pill from being sent by mail amounts to another significant constraint of abortion access that could be felt even in states where abortion remains legal, some of which have already begun stockpiling mifepristone over worries that the drug will become unavailable.

The Justice Department said it would ask the U. S. Supreme Court for an emergency order to stop the lower court ruling from taking effect.

“We are going to continue to fight in the courts, we believe the law is on our side, and we will prevail,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday, speaking from Dublin during a visit by President Joe Biden.

Mifepristone was approved by the FDA more than two decades ago and is used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol.

Abortion rights groups expressed both relief over FDA approval remaining in place and outrage over the appeals court reinstating restrictions. Whole Woman’s Health, an abortion provider that operates six clinics in five states, said in a tweet it was continuing to offer mifepristone in clinics and through virtual services while reviewing the decision.

In the 2-1 decision, the judges put on hold changes made by the regulator since 2016 that relaxed the rules for prescribing and dispensing mifepristone. Those included extending the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used from seven weeks to 10 and allowing it to be dispensed by mail, without any need to visit a doctor’s office.

The panel’s decision came just days after the Justice Department appealed last week’s far-reaching ruling out of Texas that blocked the FDA’s approval of the pill. The lawsuit was filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that also argued to overturn Roe v. Wade, and is representing a group of anti-abortion doctors.

There is virtually no precedent for a lone judge overturning the regulator’s medical decisions.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs indicated Thursday that they were content with the court’s order and did not plan to seek an appeal that might restore the Texas court’s full ruling.

“The 5th Circuit’s decision is a significant victory for the doctors we represent, women’s health, and every American who deserves an accountable federal government acting within the bounds of the law,” said Erin Hawley, an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom.

The two judges who voted to tighten restrictions, Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham, are both appointees of former President Donald Trump. The third judge, Catharina Haynes, is an appointee of former President George W. Bush. She said she would have put the lower court ruling on hold entirely for now to allow oral arguments in the case.

Adding to the uncertainty, a separate federal judge in Washington state last week ordered the FDA not to do anything that might block mifepristone’s availability in 17 Democrat-led states suing to keep it on the market. The judge in that case clarified Thursday that his order requires the FDA to keep access the same as it was in January in those states, leaving the agency facing conflicting court orders.

“This is just as much of a binding court order as whatever comes out of Texas,” said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University’s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.

The New Orleans appeals court judges in the majority in Wednesday’s decision noted that the Biden administration and mifepristone’s manufacturer “warn us of significant public consequences” that would result if mifepristone were withdrawn entirely from the market under the lower court ruling.

But the judges suggested FDA changes making mifepristone easier to obtain since 2016 were less consequential than its initial approval of the drug in 2000. It would be “difficult” to argue the changes were “so critical to the public given that the nation operated — and mifepristone was administered to millions of women — without them for 16 years” the judges wrote.

When the drug was initially approved, the FDA limited its use to up to seven weeks of pregnancy. It also required three in-person office visits: the first to administer mifepristone, the next to administer the second drug, misoprostol, and the third to address any complications. It also required a doctor’s supervision and a reporting system for any serious consequences of the drug.

If the appeals court’s action stands, those would again be the terms under which mifepristone could be dispensed for now.

Democratic leaders in states where abortion remains legal since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year say they are preparing in case mifepristone becomes restricted. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday that her state would stockpile 150,000 doses of misoprostol.

The White House also has contingency plans in place, but Jean-Pierre held off detailing them while legal action continued. Instead, she described a proposed new federal rule to limit how law enforcement and state officials collect medical records if they investigate women who flee their home states to seek abortions elsewhere.

At the core of the Texas lawsuit is the allegation that the FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone was flawed because the agency did not adequately review safety risks.

Mifepristone has been used by millions of women over the past 23 years. While less drastic than completely overturning the drug’s approval, the latest ruling still represents a stark challenge to the FDA’s authority overseeing how prescription drugs are used in the U. S. The panel overturned multiple decisions made by FDA regulators after years of scientific review.

Common side effects with mifepristone include cramping, bleeding, nausea, headache and diarrhea. In rare cases, women can experience excess bleeding that requires surgery to stop.

Still, in loosening restrictions on mifepristone, FDA regulators cited “exceedingly low rates of serious adverse events.”

More than 5.6 million women in the U. S. had used the drug as of June 2022, according to the FDA. In that period, the agency received 4,200 reports of complications in women, or less than one-tenth of 1% of women who took the drug.

251,An AP Investigation,"In the early morning hours of May 28, 2021, a strange boat appeared in the Caribbean. As local fishermen approached it, they made a grisly discovery: Everyone aboard it was dead.The boat and its passengers' origins were a mystery.Yet what remained held clues to their story.BELLE GARDEN, Tobago (AP) –Around 6:30 a.m. on May 28, 2021, a couple of miles from Belle Garden Beach on the Caribbean island of Tobago, a narrow white-and-blue boat drifted onto the horizon.

As it wobbled back and forth, fish gathered, feeding on the barnacles that had grown below the surface.

From a distance, it seemed no one was aboard. But as fishermen approached, they smelled death.

Inside were the decomposing bodies of more than a dozen Black men. No one knew where they were from, what brought them there, why they were aboard — and how or why they died. No one knew their names.

What is clear now, but wasn’t then, is this:

For nearly two years, The Associated Press assembled puzzle pieces from across three continents to uncover the story of this boat — and the people it carried from hope to death.

The vessel that reached Tobago was registered in Mauritania, a large and mostly deserted country in northwest Africa nearly 3,000 miles (4,800 km) away. Evidence found on the boat — and its style and color as a typical Mauritanian “pirogue”— suggested the dead were likely African migrants who were trying to reach Europe but got lost in the Atlantic.

In 2021, at least seven boats appearing to be from northwest Africa washed up in the Caribbean and in Brazil. All carried dead bodies.

These “ghost boats” — and likely many others that have vanished — are in part an unintended result of years of efforts and billions of dollars spent by Europe to stop crossings on the Mediterranean Sea. That crackdown, along with other factors such as economic disruption from the pandemic, pushed migrants to return to the far longer, more obscure and more dangerous Atlantic route to Europe from northwest Africa via the Canaries instead.

Arrivals on the Atlantic route jumped from 2,687 in 2019 to more than 22,000 two years later, according to Spain’s Interior Ministry. But for those to arrive, many more must have departed, said Pedro Vélez, an oceanographer at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography. Vélez wasn’t surprised to learn of migrant boats appearing in the Caribbean – that is where floating devices dropped by scientists on the West African coast naturally drift.

“The sea conditions there are extremely harsh,” he said. “Extremely harsh.”

In 2021, at least 1,109 people died or disappeared trying to reach the Canaries, according to the International Organization for Migration, the deadliest on record. But that’s likely a fraction of the real death toll. The men in the Tobago boat, for example, are not included in this number.

Other estimates are higher. Caminando Fronteras, a Spanish migrants’ rights organization, recorded more than 4,000 dead or missing on the Atlantic route in 2021, with at least 20 boats vanishing after departing from Mauritania.

These migrants are as invisible in death as they were in life. But even ghosts have families.

The AP investigation included interviews with dozens of relatives and friends, officials and forensic experts, as well as police documents and DNA testing. It found that 43 young men from Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and possibly other West African nations boarded the boat. AP has identified 33 of them by name.

They departed the Mauritanian port city of Nouadhibou in the middle of the night between Jan. 12 and 13, 2021. Clothing and DNA testing confirmed the identity of one of the bodies, bringing closure to one family and opening the way for others to seek the same.

The lack of political will and global resources to identify dead and disappeared migrants mean such resolutions, even partial ones, are rare. Each year, thousands of families wonder about the fate of loved ones who left their homes for Europe.

Few ever find out.

This is the story of one boat and the people it carried from hope to death.

On the morning of May 28, 2021, Lance Biggart got a call from one of his fellow fishermen. A strange boat had appeared.

The 49-year-old Tobago native quickly reached his colleagues aboard his small but speedy boat, the Big Thunder. Dozens of fishermen joined him at the scene, filming the pirogue with their smartphones. Some continued fishing shiny mahi-mahi that had gathered around the corpses, life circling around death.

Biggart remembers being puzzled by how the boat could have survived Atlantic swells.

“A wave came, and the boat rocked so, so badly,” he recalls.

One of the dead men sat by the bow. The fishermen and police wondered if he was the last to die, moving away from the rest of the dead in the bottom of the boat. Biggart and his colleague were asked by the coast guard to tow the pirogue back to shore. A tractor pulled the boat out of the water.

Men in white overalls carefully removed 14 bodies, three skulls and other large bones one by one, placing the remains in 15 bags. Some victims were missing limbs or heads. The sun had mummified some parts, while the salt and water at the bottom of the boat had putrified others.

Recovered from the boat were clothing, 1,000 West African CFA francs (under $2) and a few euros. Police also found half a dozen corroded cellphones with SIM cards from Mali and Mauritania. Tobago’s Cyber Crime Unit extracted a contact list from one of the SIMs.

Police in Trinidad and Tobago passed the numbers on to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which reached out several times to the government of Mauritania. They never got an answer, they said. Mauritania’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to phone calls or repeated requests for comment by email from the AP.

In the weeks that followed, customers stopped buying Biggart’s fish, fearing the dead were victims of some sort of sorcery. Others made unfounded speculations: Were they Ebola victims whose bodies had been thrown in the boat and set adrift?

As a man of the sea himself, Biggart felt responsible.

“I have a friend who went to sea and never came back,” he says. “I don’t know the people and them. But I know the family will be hurting.”

Yet months later, unable to identify the victims, police rebranded the criminal investigation into a “humanitarian” case. The remains were kept at the morgue of the Forensic Science Center in Trinidad.

To this day, there they sit.

In 20 years as a forensic pathologist, Dr. Eslyn McDonald-Burris had never seen so many bodies arrive at the local mortuary in Tobago at once. Their apparent African descent reminded her of her enslaved ancestors.

“It’s kind of emotional for me, because I’m thinking why? What is happening here?” asked the soft-spoken Burris, who has since retired. “And then when I started looking at ocean currents. ... It’s the same currents that they used when they brought us here.” She concluded they most likely died of “dehydration and hypothermia as a consequence of being lost at sea.”

Opening the body bags one by one, Burris was opening a small window into each person’s life. She looked for anything to help answer questions: Who were they? Where were they trying to go? What happened on the boat?

One had prayer beads with a crescent and a star, Muslim symbols. Another carried in his pocket a small label with Arabic writing of a water bottle from Mauritania. Yet another wore a watch on his left wrist, still running even though the time and date were wrong. “5:32 Sun,” it read.

Most shared similar traits — “that sort of tall, slender look, long thin face,” Burris says. Many wore several layers of clothing, common for seafaring migrants. A few wore dark green weather-proof jackets and pants, typically used both by fishermen in West Africa and by migrants seeking to avoid detection by port authorities.

As Burris pulled back the layers of clothing, she found soccer jerseys and shorts with the insignia of European teams as well as the Football Federation of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. One man was dressed more formally, wearing a black button-down shirt with thin white stripes.

Another stood out to Burris. “A young man of African descent, slim build, dark complexion,” her autopsy report read.

He had short, dark-brown hair. His ears were “notably very small."" His teeth were in good condition. His body was the most mummified of all, and his clothing was still relatively clean, suggesting he may have been one of the last to die.

“Down here we say a ‘sharp boy’,” Burris said, affectionately referring to his style.

He was found wearing distressed jeans, a Nike hoodie and a white patterned T-shirt underneath with some words on it — a lyric to a well-known Lionel Richie song.

It read: “HELLO, IS IT ME YOU’RE LOOKING FOR?”

Thousands of miles away, in the French city of Orléans, May Sow had all but given up hope of finding her nephew alive.

It was mid-January 2021, and Alassane Sow, 30, wasn’t answering his phone, leaving his family in both Mali and France desperate. May searched the internet for any trace of him.

A few days earlier, Alassane had told her over the phone that he was thinking of boarding a boat to Spain and, ultimately, to France to work, as some of his friends had done. His estranged father had also left for Spain. Smugglers charged 1,500 euros, and he had saved some money working as a security guard in Mauritania.

She thought it was a terrible idea. “It’s suicide,” she warned him. A family she knew from the Ivory Coast was mourning a relative who died trying to reach Europe.

Alassane said smugglers told him he would travel on a sturdy boat with a proper engine, not the flimsy overcrowded rubber boats often seen capsizing in the Mediterranean. But even if he made it, she told him, he wouldn’t be allowed to work legally in France.

“When I go to Paris, I see people, migrants sleeping outside, under tents,” May recalled.

Alassane wouldn’t hear of it. After all, his French family had a good life with stable careers that allowed them to send money back to their Mali village of Melga, to support his mother.

Alassane’s grandparents had immigrated to France from the former colony decades ago, leaving their eldest daughter, Alassane’s mother, back in Mali. They had six more children in France, including May.

When May and her siblings tried to bring Alassane’s mother over, she was an adult no longer eligible for family reunification. She applied for a visa for France eight times, only to be rejected each time.

The Sow family in France had tried to support Alassane in two projects back in Mali, in livestock and in commerce. Both ultimately failed in part because of the impact of climate change and a fragile economy in a country plagued by years of conflict and political instability. The convenience store he opened with their help hardly made enough money to feed his family.

He ultimately moved to Mauritania to make roughly 75 euros a month, May said. That wasn’t enough.

May said the “kind, serious and respectful” young man never asked his French relatives for more money. Prosperity was in Europe, and the only way he could afford to get there was by boat.

“I think in his head, he thought he didn’t have a choice,” May said.

On the night between Jan. 12 and 13, 2021, he boarded a pirogue in Nouadhibou, Mauritania, headed to Spain’s Canary Islands, his family learned later.

After the initial silence came rumors, including one that his boat had been stopped in Morocco and the migrants sent to prison. May contacted a Malian community representative in Morocco to check prisons and morgues. No trace of Alassane.

She reached out to a page on Facebook called “Protect Migrants not Borders,” used by families of missing migrants to exchange information. That was when May realized her nephew was one of thousands disappearing each year en route to Europe.

Every day people posted about a missing person. Few were ever found.

Any tips she obtained were by word of mouth. There was no official information. She felt helpless.

Alassane’s mother, grandmother and wife held onto hope that he was alive, probably in prison somewhere, and couldn’t call. May was growing increasingly skeptical.

One night, she had a dream. She saw him dead with many people in the water, and she cried out for him.

In her nightmare, Alassane eventually opened his eyes but couldn’t speak. After that, she was sure they had shipwrecked. But she had no proof.

A few months later, her sister shared a news report about a Mauritanian boat found in Tobago with dead bodies inside. Then an AP reporter contacted her asking about the same. Could her nephew be among those?

He left in January. The boat was found in May. But except for the time frame, there was no evidence to suggest it was his boat. After all, the pirogues used by migrants departing Nouadhibou look the same.

The contact list extracted from one of the SIM cards on a phone in the boat by authorities in Tobago contained 137 names.

The AP went down the list calling the numbers, asking those who replied if they knew anyone missing. One name kept coming up: Soulayman Soumaré, a taxi driver from Sélibaby in southern Mauritania, near the borders with Mali and Senegal.

The AP traveled to Sélibaby, a two-day drive from the fishing town of Nouadhibou on a strip of tarmac that cuts through a bleak desert, and spoke to dozens of relatives and friends to reconstruct what happened.

Soulayman had gone missing a year earlier, along with dozens of other young men from nearby villages. They had taken off from Nouadhibou on a boat carrying 43 people to the Canary Islands on the night of Jan. 12, 2021. It was the same boat that Alassane Sow boarded.

Forty-seven people were meant to have boarded the boat originally. Four men never got on. One, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, confirmed that he and dozens of other relatives, friends and acquaintances from Sélibaby and two nearby villages had traveled to Nouadhibou. There, they waited in apartments arranged by smugglers. He heard more people from a town on the border of Mali and Mauritania would also be getting on the boat.

Finally, on Jan. 12, the smugglers called. They would be leaving for Spain that night.

To avoid attracting authorities’ attention, the migrants split into smaller groups and left separately on different pirogues. They were to meet in the ocean and all transfer to a larger pirogue bound for the Canaries.

In Nouadhibou, hundreds of fishermen zip in and out all day and night, and port authorities struggle to inspect every boat for migrants. But when they saw four men allegedly going fishing without the typical dark green overalls, police stopped them.

Little did they know that their lives had just been spared.

Just as few people in Tobago had ever heard of Mauritania before, families in Mauritania had never heard of Tobago. When shown the island on a map, with the Atlantic Ocean separating both nations, many gasped.

A few miles away from Sélibaby, on a dirt road dotted with goats, lies the village of Bouroudji, home to 11 of the missing young men. AP reporters shared the available information with their mothers: A Mauritanian boat had drifted to Tobago with 14 bodies. One phone retrieved from the boat was linked to the group their sons had traveled with. There were no known survivors.

“They’re all dead,” one mother exclaimed. She covered her face with her hands and left in despair.

Others hung onto hope. Until they saw their sons’ bodies, the mothers said, they could still be alive. They pulled out their cellphones and shared photos of their sons with AP. Among them were two young men named Bayla Niang and Abdoulaye Tall.

Niang’s father, 71-year-old Ciré Samba Niang, said they were desperate for any information.

“There’s people who say they’ve died. There are people who say they are in prison,” he said. “There are others who say, nonsense.”

Niang said he wasn’t aware of his son’s plans. He blamed local unemployment along with better opportunities abroad. Many in his generation had also moved to Europe and made good money for Mauritanian standards.

“If one goes to Europe, in one or two years they’ll be able to build a house (in Mauritania), to buy a car,” Niang said. “The other person sees that and says, ‘I can’t stay here. I have to go, too.’”

Clockwise starting from the top left:  Houdou Soumaré, Cheikh Dioum, Houdou and Soulayman with Djibi Koumé, Soulayman Soumaré. Images courtesy of the families.In the nearby village of Moudji, the parents of Soulayman Soumaré and his cousins Houdou Soumaré and Djibi Koumé, who had also disappeared, struggled to get on with their lives. One mother was severely depressed and suffering from panic attacks, the villagers said. “You cannot even talk because everyone is so upset,” said Oumar Koumé, the father of Djibi Koumé.

Like the mothers of Bouroudji, Koumé asked to see the bodies found in the boat that reached Tobago.

“If you see someone is dead in front of you, you know it is done. But if you don’t see it, every day there are rumors,” he said. “Your heart aches.”

Adama Sarré is a 46-year-old nurse and single mother. Her 25-year-old son, Cheikh Dioum, is among those who disappeared.

An introvert, Dioum would sometimes stay in his room for days, his mother said. He was upset, frustrated. He had repeatedly asked her for money to travel to Europe. But on her meager nurse’s salary, she had little to give him. She advised patience. She recalled telling him: “Cheikh, go slowly, go slowly. If I work and find money, I will get you a plane ticket and you will go.”

Dioum thought she was lying, she said. He left without saying goodbye.

“I call his phone, it doesn’t work,” she said. “I’m just sitting here.”

We may never know what happened to the men as they drifted from Nouadhibou to Tobago. But accounts from survivors of other shipwrecks in the Atlantic offer a clue.

Moussa Sako was rescued by the Spanish Air Force on April 26, 2021. Their boat was spotted by chance more than 310 miles (500km) from the Spanish island of El Hierro — “in the middle of nowhere,” as one of the rescuers described it.

They had set off 22 days earlier from Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. Only three of 63 people who boarded survived.

Like many on the boat, Sako, an asylum-seeker from Mali, had never seen the ocean. Four men with maritime experience, including a Senegalese “captain,” were in charge of reaching the Canaries. The voyage was to take four to five days.

They were packed like sardines, with Sako squeezed in the middle. The leaking gasoline and salt water in the bottom of the boat burnt their skin, making it painful to sit.

Not long after departing, they ran out of food and water. On the fourth day they ran out of fuel. To slow down their drift and be more visible to rescuers, they made a makeshift anchor by tying the engine and other heavy metal scraps to a rope.

With each day that passed, the boat drifted further. Tensions boiled into arguments. The smugglers, some said, had betrayed them.

More days passed. No rescue came. A growing number of people wanted to cut the rope loose to drift faster. Sako thought they would be better off staying still, where the sea was still calm and they could see some lights at night. But Sako was defeated in a vote. The rope was snipped.

Just as he feared, the wind took them to more agitated waters that poured over their boat. The next evening the first person died, a 20-year-old man. They washed and wrapped his body in Islamic tradition and prayed before throwing it overboard.

By the second week, three to four people were dying every day.

Some had hallucinations. One man jumped to his death thinking they had arrived. Others jumped to end their suffering. Sako, the healthiest, tried to help the others.

“I had four full (layers of clothes) on me,” he recalled. “I would take one off and put it on them ... until I had only one.”

On day 18, he tried to get away from the rotting bodies. But they were everywhere. Only a handful of people were still alive. They hardly spoke.

Sako no longer feared death. He did worry about what would happen afterward.

“I wanted that even if I died, for people to recover (my body) and bury me,” Sako said. “If you disappear in the water, they can look for you for a hundred years.”

Finally, on day 22, a grey plane appeared in the sky above. Then came a helicopter. A rescuer dropped down and pulled Sako and the other two survivors from the corpse-ridden pirogue.

The bodies of 24 people were recovered and buried in the Canaries with case numbers instead of names. The remains of the other 36 were swallowed by the Atlantic.

The number of people attempting the Atlantic crossing to the Canaries is falling again as Spain and the EU, with help from their African partners, try to close that migration route in a constant cat-and-mouse game. But the reasons pushing these men, women and children to go — a lack of jobs, poverty, violence, climate change — have only gotten worse.

One year after the 43 men departed Nouadhibou, the white-and-blue boat sat abandoned on the side of the road in Belle Garden, much like the case itself.

The clothing, objects and cellphones recovered from the boat and the bodies had been kept in the back of the Scarborough police station in Tobago. Even though it had been cleared for disposal, the officer in charge of storing police evidence had decided to hold onto the items “in case someone came looking for this some day.”

With latex gloves, the officer and an AP reporter cut open the sealed bags, pulling out the decaying evidence on the concrete floor to be documented.

There were the dirty soccer jerseys and shorts of Juventus, Paris St-Germain, Barcelona, Real Madrid and The Football Federation of Mauritania that Burris had noted in her autopsy reports. There were the dark green weatherproof coats and pants so many migrants wear during the crossing. There were the cellphones, so worn out that the devices fell apart at the slightest touch.

After days analyzing photos of the evidence like a puzzle, one T-shirt seemed familiar. In a photo shared by one of the mothers from the Mauritanian village of Bourdouji, 20-year-old Abdoulaye Tall is seen wearing a colorful T-shirt with words on it, but only parts of it were visible: “IS IT ... E ... YOU’RE.”

Suddenly, it came into focus. He was wearing the shirt that had struck Dr. Burris: “HELLO, IS IT ME YOU’RE LOOKING FOR?”

The AP shared its finding, along with photos of the T-shirt, with Tall’s father. He said he was grateful for the information, even though it shattered his hopes.

The AP also shared photos of the evidence collected in Tobago with other families of the missing in Mauritania, Mali, Senegal and France.

May Sow, the aunt in France, stared at the photos on her phone for days and stayed up late at night. One photo looked familiar: a black striped button-down shirt.

She went back to photos of her nephew from shortly before he disappeared. There it was — the same black striped shirt. He wore it on special occasions.

“I don’t think they had the right to bring things with them, so he must have worn his best clothes,” she said.

She reached out to one of Alassane’s friends in Mauritania who had accompanied him on the first part of the journey to the boat. He confirmed that Alassane had worn the striped shirt underneath a jacket with red pockets. Both were found on one of the bodies.

May Sow was already mourning the loss of her nephew, but her sister was still in denial. Sow reached out to the Red Cross in Senegal for help with a DNA test to confirm. But because Alassane’s mother was from Mali, they couldn’t help.

So in late June, the AP got a saliva sample sent from Alassane’s mother to the Forensics Science Center in Trinidad and Tobago.

Three months later, on Oct. 4, 2022, an email arrived in May Sow’s inbox.

“I regret to inform that the DNA sample result is a positive match.”

Alassane was buried after an Islamic funeral on March 3, 2023, at the Chaguanas Public Cemetery in Trinidad and Tobago. His family, unable to travel, held prayers in both his hometown in Mali and in France.

Of the 43 people believed to have boarded Alassane’s boat, only 14 bodies and skeletal remains were found in Tobago. The Red Cross has collected 51 DNA samples from family members of 26 missing migrants in hopes of identifying the other bodies at the Forensic Science Center in Trinidad. Those results aren’t yet known.

Some things are, in the end, unknowable. It’s possible — probable, even — that the world will never learn what exactly happened during the 135 days and nights that Alassane and the others spent adrift in the Atlantic.

But at least May Sow knows one thing now.

“At least, for my nephew, we have proof that it is him,” she said. “We can pray for him and believe that he is in a good place.”

252,"What is Discord, the chatting app tied to classified leaks?","PROVIDENCE, R. I. (AP) — The chatting app Discord, which is one of the most popular ways gamers communicate online, finds itself at the center of an investigation into the leak of classified documents about the war in Ukraine.

The investigation is unfolding as Discord makes an ambitious push to recruit more users and expand the way they use the versatile app.

Discord said it is cooperating with law enforcement in the investigation of the leak, which is believed to have started on the site. A Massachusetts Air National Guard member reportedly posted on Discord for years about guns, games, favorite memes and, according to some who chatted with him, closely guarded U. S. secrets.

Discord started in 2015 as a nerdy online hangout for gamers and had some hiccups in its quest for mainstream success. Its growth accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic as a forum for its mostly younger users to gossip or even help each other with homework.

“Every month, more than 150 million people come to Discord to hang out with family, friends and communities,” its co-founder and CEO, Jason Citron, said last month at a press event. “It’s become a place where they have fun and get things done together.”

Discord users skew young — about 38% of its web users and nearly half of its Android app users are between the ages of 18 and 24, according to digital intelligence platform Similarweb. They are roughly 75% male, the research group says.

Recently, the app has also pitched itself as a gateway to artificial intelligence tools such as Midjourney, which conjures up new imagery based on commands it’s given in a Discord chat.

Discord announced in January that it was buying another teen-focused social app called Gas, which enables people to share online polls and uplifting compliments.

The purchase was part of a larger push to target communities beyond gaming, according to Insider Intelligence analyst Jeremy Goldman. Goldman said Discord has also benefited from the turmoil surrounding Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover as a “not-insignificant number” of gamers put Discord handles on their Twitter profiles to show they were decamping.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Discord can be accessed through desktops, smartphones or gaming consoles such as Xbox and PlayStation. It allows users to create invite-only “servers.”

The servers, which resemble the professional messaging platform Slack, allow users to create subchannels where they can communicate over text, voice or video chats.

Some users might have “friend servers” of several dozen people they know in real life, while others might join larger servers devoted to an online community of people interested in a specific topic.

The company hosts nearly 21,000 servers, the vast majority of which are dedicated to gaming. Others are focused on topics like generative AI, entertainment or music.

WHAT ABOUT THE LEAKED DOCUMENTS?

The Massachusetts Air National Guard member was identified as Jack Teixeira, 21, who was arrested Thursday in connection with the disclosure of highly classified military documents about the Ukraine war and other top national security issues. The breach has raised questions about America’s ability to safeguard its most sensitive secrets.

Some of the leaks are believed to have started on Discord. A chat group called “Thug Shaker Central” drew roughly two dozen enthusiasts who talked about their favorite guns and shared memes and jokes, some of them racist. The group also included a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In that discussion, one user known as “the O. G.” would for months post material that he said was classified.

HAS DISCORD BEEN INVOLVED WITH ANY OTHER INVESTIGATIONS?

The white gunman who killed 10 Black shoppers and workers last year at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, shared detailed plans for the attack with a small group of people on Discord about half an hour beforehand.

The diary, kept on a private, invite-only server, included months of racist, antisemitic entries along with step-by-step descriptions of the shooter’s assault plans, a detailed account of a reconnaissance trip he made, and hand-drawn maps of the store. He livestreamed the attack on a different platform, Twitch.

Discord said 15 users clicked on the invitation and would have had access to his entries before the attack. There was no evidence anyone saw them before then.

Discord said it removed the diary and banned the shooter’s account as soon as it became aware of them. The company said it also took steps to prevent content related to the attack from spreading.

Since 2020, Discord has been part of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a group co-founded by tech companies such as Microsoft, Facebook and YouTube that works to tamp down the spread of mass shooting videos livestreamed by their perpetrators.",0
253,US wholesale inflation pressures eased sharply last month,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U. S. wholesale prices fell in March, a sign that inflationary pressures in the economy are easing more than a year after the Federal Reserve began aggressively raising interest rates.

Plunging energy prices pulled the government’s producer price index down 0.5% from February to March; it had been unchanged from January to February. Compared with a year ago, wholesale prices were up 2.7% in March — the mildest 12-month increase since January 2021 and down significantly from a 4.7% annual rise in February.

The Labor Department’s producer price index reflects prices charged by manufacturers, farmers and wholesalers. It can provide an early sign of how fast consumer inflation will rise.

A huge drop in wholesale gasoline accounted for much of the sharp slowdown in producer prices. But even excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core wholesale inflation fell 0.1% in March, the first such drop in nearly three years. The Fed and many private economists regard core prices as a better gauge of underlying inflation. Core wholesale inflation was up just 3.4% from March 2022, the lowest year-over-year rise since 2021.

Behind last month’s drop in core prices was a sharp decline in wholesale costs for warehousing and transportation. Overall services prices fell 0.3%, the first such drop since November 2020.

Wholesale inflation has come down steadily — from a record 11.7% year-over-year increase in March 2022 — since the Fed began raising its benchmark interest rate to fight the worst inflation bout in four decades. Beginning in March of last year, the Fed has raised its key short-term rate nine times and is expected to do so again at its next meeting, May 2-3.

“We expect the bite from the Fed’s previous rate hikes will further reduce business and consumer demand, pushing producer price inflation lower throughout the rest of the year,″ economists Matthew Martin and Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note.

Thursday’s figures follow a report Wednesday that showed that U. S. consumer inflation eased in March, with less expensive gas and food providing some relief to Americans. Still, consumer prices continue to rise fast enough to keep the Fed on track to further raise rates.

Core consumer inflation, in particular, remains stubbornly high. Measured year over year, core prices are up 5.6%, far above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. The year-over-year core consumer inflation figure rose in March for the first time in six months.

The collapse last month of two major U. S. banks, which shook the financial industry, has complicated the Fed’s interest rate decisions. Minutes of the Fed’s March meeting, which followed the bank failures, show that the turmoil led the central bank to coalesce around a decision to raise its benchmark rate by just a quarter-point, rather than a half-point.

According to the minutes, Fed officials agreed that the banking industry’s troubles “would likely lead to some weakening of credit conditions,” as banks sought to preserve capital by curtailing lending to consumers and businesses.

Fed officials who spoke this week have emphasized the importance of monitoring bank lending. There are already reports of small companies struggling to obtain loans, though it’s not yet clear how widespread the impact will be.

On Wednesday, the Fed also revealed that its staff economists have forecast that a pullback in bank lending will cause a “mild recession” starting later this year. That was a shift from their previous estimates, which had predicted that the economy would eke out positive growth for 2023.

At the same time, according to the minutes of last month’s Fed meeting, if the impact of the banking turmoil ends up being less than expected, a recession might be avoided.",0
254,Biden says nothing of 'great consequence' in Pentagon leaks,"DUBLIN (AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday said while he was concerned that sensitive government documents had been leaked, “there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.”

It was the first time Biden has commented publicly about the release of Pentagon documents that were posted on several social media sites. They appear to detail U. S. and NATO aid to Ukraine and U.S. intelligence assessments regarding U.S. allies that could strain ties with those nations. The Justice Department has opened an investigation.

“I’m concerned that it happened, but there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence,” said Biden, who is in Dublin visiting with Irish leaders Thursday.

Biden noted that a “full-blown” investigation was underway by the intelligence community and the Justice Department on who leaked the information. “We’re getting close,” he said on answers. “But I don’t have an answer.”

There are no clear answers on how many documents were leaked. The Associated Press has viewed approximately 50 documents; some estimates put the total number in the hundreds.

Some of the document s may have been altered or used as part of a misinformation campaign, U. S. officials said. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Monday urged caution, “since we know at least in some cases that information was doctored.”

No one knows for sure where they came from, not even the Pentagon chief.

“They were somewhere in the web, and where exactly, and who had access at that point, we don’t know. We simply don’t know,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at a news conference Tuesday. “We will continue to investigate and turn over every rock until we find the source of this and the extent of it.”

It’s possible, though, that the leak may have started on a site called Discord.

Discord is a social media platform popular with people playing online games. The Discord site hosts real-time voice, video and text chats for groups and describes itself as a place “where you can belong to a school club, a gaming group, or a worldwide art community.”

On Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre urged social media companies to “avoid facilitating the circulation of material detrimental to public safety and national security.”

“We do believe that social media companies have a responsibility to their users and the country to manage the private sector infrastructure that they create and then operate,” she said.",0
255,Grizzlies guard Ja Morant files countersuit against teen,"Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant has filed a countersuit against the Memphis teenager suing the two-time All-Star, accusing the teen of slander, battery and assault over a pickup basketball game at Morant’s home last July.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday night in Shelby County Circuit Court accuses Joshua Holloway, whose lawsuit was amended March 28 after he turned 18, of damaging Morant’s reputation and putting him at risk of losing millions of dollars both in his contract and in potential endorsement deals.

Morant declined to comment Thursday when asked about his countersuit after practice. The Grizzlies are the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference preparing to host LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers starting Sunday.

The guard signed a five-year, $193 million contract last July that includes a $38 million bonus for making the All-NBA team this season. The NBA suspended Morant eight games in March for “conduct detrimental to the league” for displaying a firearm at a suburban Denver club on March 4.

Morant’s countersuit notes the lawsuit was reported nationally despite being under seal until the amended version was filed March 28 and that the lawsuit potentially jeopardizes the guard’s relationships with sponsors including some “unconsummated deals in progress.”

In the countersuit, Morant also accuses the teen of lying to police, in the original lawsuit and then changing his story in the amended version.

Morant says in the countersuit he punched Holloway once after being hit in the face with a basketball during a July 26 pickup game at his home after the teen approached the Grizzlies guard with “balled up” fists.

Holloway’s attorneys did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on Morant’s countersuit.

Holloway’s amended lawsuit accuses “one or both” Morant and his friend Davonte Pack of punching him even after he went to the ground and that Morant pointed to a gun at his hip as the teen left. According to the teen’s lawsuit, Holloway’s mother called police when he arrived home that night.

“These statements were false, and Counter-Defendant had actual knowledge of their falsehood or had reckless disregard for the truth,” according to Morant’s countersuit.

The countersuit cites witnesses estimating the altercation lasted 10 seconds before Morant’s father escorted Holloway out as the Grizzlies guard stayed on the court. On his way out, the countersuit alleges Holloway yelled he would return to “light (Mr. Morant’s) house up like a firework show.”

Morant also says he later received a threat on Snapchat appearing to be from Holloway, prompting him and his family to report the teen’s threats to the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department on Aug. 8. Eight witnesses filed affidavits, and the local district attorney declined to file any charges Oct. 27.

256,US jobless claims rise but remain at historically low levels,"U. S. applications for jobless benefits rose to their highest level in more than a year, but remain at relatively low levels despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and job market in its battle against inflation.

Jobless claims in the U. S. for the week ending April 8 rose by 11,000 to 239,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. That’s the most since January of 2022 when 251,000 people filed for unemployment benefits.

The four-week moving average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week fluctuations, rose by 2,250 to 240,000. That’s the most since November of 2021.

Last week, the Labor Department unveiled revised estimates of the number of weekly applications for jobless benefits under a new formula it is using to reflect seasonal adjustments. The new formula, which led to an increase in its weekly tally, is intended to more accurately capture seasonal patterns in job losses.

Applications for unemployment benefits are broadly seen reflective of the number of layoffs in the U. S.

The job market seems to be finally showing some signs of softening, more than a year after the Federal Reserve began an aggressive campaign to cool inflation by raising its benchmark borrowing rate nine times in about a year.

America’s employers added a solid 236,000 jobs in March, suggesting that the economy remains on solid footing despite the nine interest rate hikes the Federal Reserve has imposed over the past year in its drive to tame inflation. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, just above the 53-year low of 3.4% set in January.

In its latest quarterly projections, the Fed predicts that the unemployment rate will rise to 4.5% by year’s end, a sizable increase historically associated with recessions.

Also last week, the Labor Department reported that U. S. job openings slipped to 9.9 million in February, the fewest since May 2021.

Some details from Friday’s Labor Department report raised the possibility that inflationary pressures might be easing and that the Fed might soon decide to pause its rate hikes. Average hourly wages were up 4.2% from 12 months earlier, down sharply from a 4.6% year-over-year increase in February.

Also Thursday, the government reported that wholesale prices fell sharply in March. One day earlier, the government said consumer prices rose just 0.1% from February to March, down from 0.4% from January to February and the smallest increase since December. However, prices are still rising fast enough to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least once more, beginning in May.

Layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies hired aggressively during the pandemic. IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months. Amazon and Facebook have each announced two sets of job cuts since November.

About 1.81 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended April 1, a decrease of 13,000 from the week before. That number is close to pre-pandemic levels.",0
257,Montana close to becoming 1st state to completely ban TikTok,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Montana lawmakers moved one step closer Thursday to passing a bill to ban TikTok from operating in the state, a move that’s bound to face legal challenges but also serve as a testing ground for the TikTok-free America that many national lawmakers have envisioned.

Montana’s proposal, which has backing from the state’s GOP-controlled legislature, is more sweeping than bans in place in nearly half the states and the U. S. federal government that prohibit TikTok on government devices.

The House endorsed the bill 60-39 on Thursday. A final House vote will likely take place Friday before the bill goes to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte. He has banned TikTok on government devices in Montana. The Senate passed the bill 30-20 in March.

TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance, has been under intense scrutiny over concerns it could hand over user data to the Chinese government or push pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation on the platform. Leaders at the FBI, CIA and numerous lawmakers of both parties have raised those concerns but haven’t presented any evidence to prove it has happened.

Supporters of a ban point to two Chinese laws that compel companies in the country to cooperate with the government on state intelligence work. They also point out other troubling episodes, such as a disclosure by ByteDance in December that it fired four employees who accessed the IP addresses and other data of two journalists while attempting to uncover the source of a leaked report about the company.

Congress is considering legislation that doesn’t call out TikTok, but gives the Commerce Department the ability to restrict foreign threats on tech platforms. That bill is being backed by the White House, but it has received pushback from privacy advocates, right-wing commentators and others who say the language is too broad.

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen urged state lawmakers to pass the bill because he wasn’t sure Congress would act quickly on a federal ban.

“I think Montana’s got an opportunity here to be a leader,” Knudsen, a Republican, told a House committee in March. He says the app is a tool used by the Chinese government to spy on Montanans.

Montana’s ban would not take effect until January 2024 and would be void if Congress passes a ban or if TikTok were no longer tied to the Chinese government.

The bill would prohibit downloads of TikTok in Montana and would fine any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — $10,000 per day for each time someone “is offered the ability” to access the social media platform or download the app. The penalties would not apply to users.

Opponents argued the bill amounted to government overreach and that residents could easily circumvent the proposed ban by using a Virtual Private Network. A VPN encrypts internet traffic and makes it more difficult for third parties to track online activities, steal data and determine a person’s location.

At a hearing for the bill in March, a representative from the tech trade group TechNet said app stores also “do not have the ability to geofence” apps on a state by state basis and that it would be impossible for its members, like Apple and Google, to prevent TikTok from being downloaded in Montana.

Knudsen said Thursday the geofencing technology is used with online sports gambling apps, which he said are deactivated in states where online gambling is illegal. Ashley Sutton, TechNet’s executive director for Washington state and the northwest, said in a statement Thursday that the “responsibility should be on an app to determine where it can operate, not an app store.”

“We’ve expressed these concerns to lawmakers. We hope the governor will work with lawmakers to amend the legislation to ensure companies that aren’t intended targets of the legislation” aren’t affected, Sutton said.

Some opponents also argued the state wasn’t looking to ban other social media apps that collect similar types of data from their users.

“We also believe this is a blatant exercise of censorship and is an egregious violation of Montanans’ free speech rights,” said Keegan Medrano with the ACLU of Montana.

Democratic Rep. Katie Sullivan offered an amendment Thursday to broaden the ban to include any social media app that collected personal information and transferred it to a foreign adversary, such as Russia, Iran, Cuba, North Korea and Venezuela, along with China. The amendment was narrowly rejected 48-51.

Supporters of the bill said it made sense to target TikTok first because of specific concerns with China and that it was a step in the right direction even if it doesn’t address challenges related to other social media companies.

TikTok has been pushing back against the bill. The company, which has 150 million users in the U. S., has encouraged users in the state to speak out against the bill and hired lobbyists to do so as well. It has also purchased billboards, run full-page newspaper ads and has a website opposing Montana’s legislation. Some ads placed in local newspapers highlight how local businesses were able to use the app to drive sales.

The bill would “show Montana doesn’t support entrepreneurs in our own state,” Shauna White Bear, who owns White Bear Moccasins, said during a March 28 hearing. She noted her business receives much more engagement on TikTok than on other social media sites.

Knudsen, the attorney general whose office drafted the bill, said he expects the bill to face legal challenges if it passes.

“Frankly, I think it probably needs the courts to step in here,” he said. “This is a really interesting, novel legal question that I think is ripe for some new jurisprudence.”

The Montana bill isn’t the first blanket ban the company has faced. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump issued executive orders that banned the use of TikTok and the Chinese messaging platform WeChat. Those efforts were nixed by the courts and shelved by the Biden administration.

TikTok continued negotiations with the administration on the security concerns tied to the app. Amid rising geopolitical tensions with China, the Biden administration more recently has threatened it could ban the app if the company’s Chinese owners don’t sell their stakes. To avoid either outcome, TikTok has been trying to sell a data safety proposal called “Project Texas” that would route all its U. S. user data to servers operated by the software giant Oracle.",0
258,Asia stocks mixed after Wall St dips on US recession warning,"BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets were mixed Thursday after the Federal Reserve said its economists expect a “mild recession” this year.

Shanghai and Hong Kong declined while Tokyo and Seoul advanced. Oil prices edged lower.

Wall Street closed lower Wednesday after the U. S. government reported inflation still is higher than the Fed’s target and notes from the central bank’s latest meeting said its economists expect lower lending to cause a “mild recession.” Traders already saw an increasing likelihood of at least a brief U.S. recession this year following interest rate hikes to cool inflation.

“It seems to be brewing recession fears that shook risk sentiments,” said Yeap Jun Rong of IG in a report. The Fed report “erodes chatters of a soft landing scenario.”

The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.1% to 3,324.30 while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 0.1% to 28,108.67. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong retreated 0.9% to 20,125.48.

The Kospi in Seoul gained 0.1% to 2,554.19 while Sydney’s S&P ASX gave up 0.2% to 7,325.70. New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets declined.

Traders have been worried the Fed and other central banks in Europe and Asia might tip the global economy into recession as they try to extinguish inflation that is near multi-decade highs.

That anxiety was briefly drowned out by fears about the health of the global financial system following two high-profile bank failures in the United States and one in Switzerland. But regulators appear to have quelled those concerns by promising more lending and other steps if needed to stabilize banks.

An update Wednesday showed U. S. consumer prices rose 5% in March over a year earlier, down from last June’s peak but still well above the Fed’s 2% target.

On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 16.99, or 0.4%, to 4,091.95. About 65% of stocks within the index fell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 38.29, or 0.1%, to 33,646.50. The Nasdaq composite lost 102.54, or 0.9%, to 11,929.34.

Traders are still largely betting the Fed will raise short-term interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, according to data from CME Group. They shaded some bets toward the possibility that the Fed will merely hold rates steady in May, something it has not done for more than a year.

Traders have built bets the Fed will have to cut interest rates later this year in order to prop up the economy.

The bond market shows nervousness about a potential recession. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 3.41% from 3.43% late Tuesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 3.96% from 4.03%.

Investors are looking ahead to the latest quarterly profit reports U. S. companies are due to start releasing this week.

Expectations are low. Analysts forecast the worst drop in S&P 500 earnings per share since the pandemic was crushing the economy in 2020. But many also expect this to mark the bottom and call for a return to growth later this year.

In energy markets, benchmark U. S. crude lost 15 cents to $83.11 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $1.73 on Wednesday to $83.26. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, shed 21 cents to $87.12 per barrel in London. It advanced $1.72 the previous session to $87.33.

The dollar gained to 133.27 yen from Wednesday’s 133.19 yen. The dollar declined to $1.0989 from $1.0995.",0
259,"As Earth warms, more 'flash droughts' suck soil, plants dry","Climate change is making droughts faster and more furious, especially a specific fast-developing heat-driven kind that catch farmers by surprise, a new study found.

The study in Thursday’s journal Science found droughts in general are being triggered faster. But it also showed that a special and particularly nasty sudden kind — called “flash droughts” by experts — is casting an ever bigger crop-killing footprint.

It comes only in the growing season – mostly summer, but also spring and fall – and is insidious because it’s caused not just by the lack of rain or snow that’s behind a typical slow-onset drought, hydrologists and meteorologists said.

What happens is the air gets so hot and so dry that it sucks water right out of plants and soil.

“It’s the increasing thirstiness of the atmosphere,” said UCLA and National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Daniel Swain, who wasn’t part of the study. Swain called the issue “very relevant in a warming climate.”

The term flash drought was coined around 2000 but it really took off in 2012, when a $30 billion sudden drought struck the central United States, one of the worst droughts since the infamous Dust Bowl devastated the Plains in the 1930s, according to the study.

“Because it occurs very, very fast people started to focus on this new phenomenon,” said study lead author Xing Yuan, dean of the School of Hydrology and Water Resources at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in China. “For the 2012 drought, actually the drought just developed in a very severe condition just within a month.”

Most of China’s Yangtze River basin last summer was struck by a flash drought that developed within only a month due to high temperatures, which also triggered wildfires, Yuan said. Parts of the river dried up and there was an energy shortage in southern China because hydropower wouldn’t work, he said.

“It developed very fast so you don’t have enough time to prepare for this drought,” Yuan said.

Another sudden drought happened in the U. S. Southeast in 2016 and was a factor in devastating wildfires in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, said Jason Otkin, a study co-author and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The current drought in the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle and Kansas started two years ago as a rapid onset drought, said Joel Lisonbee, a climatologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Integrated Drought Information System in Colorado. He wasn’t part of the study but praised it, saying “essentially a warmer world allows for faster onset of drought.”

Yuan, Otkin and their research team looked back at droughts, how fast they occurred and what kind they were, across the globe since 1951 and found flash droughts are happening more often in nearly three-quarters of the climate regions of the world. They also found droughts of all kinds happening faster.

Although they couldn’t quantify how much faster because of the variability in places and times, Yuan said it would be fair to say droughts are happening weeks earlier than they once did.

Yuan said some of the bigger increases in sudden droughts have been in Europe and Australia. Outside experts pointed to the Amazon as prone to them.

“We have to pay attention to this phenomenon because it’s increasing,” Yuan said.

Yuan’s team also used computer simulations – both with worst-case warming and more moderate warming – and projected that the proportion of flash droughts will increase in a warmer world and droughts will continue to keep happening faster.

By definition, flash droughts – because they result from low soil moisture levels – are especially bad for agriculture, experts said.

The trouble is there has been an old way of thinking that “we have months or years before we need to worry about drought,” said Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

That’s the reason why Svoboda, who wasn’t part of this study, said he pioneered the term “flash drought” and wanted to “dispel the notion that droughts only manifest themselves over long period of time.”

Svoboda’s agency recommends that farmers, ranchers, municipal water suppliers and hydropower plants come up with plans for droughts. For example, farmers and ranchers should know how susceptible they are to drought and have alternative plans for plantings or foraging.

NOAA’s Lisonbee said in an email that the problem is “in a slowly evolving drought if a farmer thinks the season ahead will be dry, they may consider a more drought-tolerant crop that season, but when a flash drought occurs it is likely the crops are already in the ground and there is little that can be done.”

260,Russian court fines Wikipedia for article about Ukraine war,"A Moscow court on Thursday again fined Wikipedia for a Russian-language article it refused to remove about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the latest in a series of government moves to silence objective reporting or criticism of the war and restrict the Russian public’s access to information.

The court fined Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that runs the free, publicly-edited online encyclopedia, 2 million rubles ($24,464) for not removing a Wikipedia article titled “Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia region,” a reference to one of four Ukrainian provinces that Russia annexed last September. Most countries have condemned the annexation, as well as that by Russia in 2014 of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, as illegal.

The state Tass news agency said the Wikimedia Foundation had failed to heed the demands of Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor to remove articles containing “false information.” Tass said a Wikipedia representative asked the court to reject the removal demand as vague.

President Vladimir Putin in recent years has increased his crackdown on criticism and factual reporting that doesn’t correspond to his government’s views or versions of events. The crackdown has widened since his troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, focusing especially on information and dissent against what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” in the neighboring country.

Through Roskomnadzor, his government has also tried, with mixed success, to technically limit Western news reports that can be seen in Russia. The BBC and some Voice of America sites are among those it has blocked but which Russians can access using virtual private networks.

This is not the first time Wikipedia has been fined for refusing to delete “false” information about the war in Ukraine.

Last week, the same Moscow court issued a fine of 800,000 rubles ($9,785) to the Wikimedia Foundation for not removing materials linked to a song by a Russian rock band called Psychea, which Russian authorities consider to be extremist.

In November 2022, the organization was fined 2 million rubles for refusing to delete “false” information in seven Wikipedia articles about the “special military operation,” including information about atrocities in Bucha and the destruction of Mariupol’s theater.

In a statement Thursday, Wikimedia’s senior legal manager, Leighanna Mixter, said the organization has not taken down the disputed content and will continue to challenge the rulings as without foundation. She said the “the steady stream of takedown orders” Wikimedia has received in recent months challenge information that is “well-sourced and in line with applicable Wikipedia policies — improved by Wikipedia volunteer editors with more citations and up-to-date information.”

Wikimedia has two active appeals for fines related to takedown notices for topics regarding the invasion of Ukraine — and the latest case “does not present any new legal issues,” she said.

“These orders are part of an ongoing effort by the Russian government to limit the spread of reliable, well-sourced information in the country,” she added, asserting that Wikimedia would resist all attempts to “try to curb free knowledge.”

A Wikipedia page on the issue notes, “Since the early 2010s, Russian Wikipedia and its editors have experienced numerous and increasing threats of nationwide blocks and country-wide enforcement of blacklisting by the Russian government, as well as several attempts to censor pages, spread propaganda, and disinform.”

Tass said Roskomnadzor will label Wikimedia in search engines as a violator of Russian law, and more action against specific articles is planned.",0
261,NPR quits Elon Musk's Twitter over 'government-funded' label,"National Public Radio is quitting Twitter after the social media platform owned by Elon Musk stamped NPR’s account with labels the news organization says are intended to undermine its credibility.

Twitter labeled NPR’s main account last week as “state-affiliated media, ” a term also used to identify media outlets controlled or heavily influenced by authoritarian governments, such as Russia and China. Twitter later changed the label to “government-funded media,” but to NPR — which relies on the government for a tiny fraction of its funding — it’s still misleading.

NPR said in a statement Wednesday that it “will no longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independent.”

“Defund @NPR,” was Musk’s tweeted response. His latest tiff with a news organization reflects a gamble for the social media platform he bought last year.

Twitter, more than any of its rivals, has said its users come to it to keep track of current events. That made it an attractive place for news outlets to share their stories and reinforced Twitter’s moves to combat the spread of misinformation. But Musk has long expressed disdain for professional journalists and said he wants to elevate the views and expertise of the “average citizen.”

The Public Broadcasting Service said Wednesday it has also stopped tweeting from its main account and that the public TV organization has no plans to resume because “Twitter’s simplistic label leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government.”

Media analysts say growing friction between Twitter and news organizations since Musk bought the platform is bad for Twitter, and bad for the public.

“It’s a shame to have proceeded in a direction where, intentionally or otherwise, Twitter is categorizing Russian propaganda outlets in a similar way to very legitimate news sources that get a very modest amount of funding from the U. S. government,” said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.

This is just the latest example of Musk tangling with mainstream news organizations. He abruptly suspended the accounts of individual journalists who wrote about Twitter late last year, claiming some were trying to reveal his location.

Twitter earlier in April removed the verification check mark on the main account of The New York Times, singling out the newspaper and disparaging its reporting after it said it would not pay Twitter for verification of its institutional accounts.

Twitter used to tag journalists and other high-profile accounts with blue check marks to verify their identity and distinguish them from impostors. But Musk has derided the marks as an undeserved status symbol and plans to take them away from anyone not buying a premium subscription. Those cost as little as $8 a month for individuals and a minimum of $1,000 a month for organizations.

Barrett said Musk appears to be intent on “insulting and antagonizing individuals and organizations that he considers to be too liberal for his taste.” But by driving away legitimate news outlets, Twitter is only harming itself, he said.

“The drift is in an unfortunate direction,” Barrett said. “You want to encourage sources of reliable, well-reported news to be present and prolific on your platform.”

NPR’s main account, which joined Twitter in 2007, had not tweeted since April 4. On Wednesday, it sent a series of tweets listing other places to find its journalism.

NPR spokesperson Isabel Lara said its journalists, employees and member stations can decide on their own if they want to keep using the platform. NPR journalists have not been given the “government-funded” label, at least not yet.

NPR does receive U. S. government funding through grants from federal agencies and departments, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The company has said it accounts for less than 1% of NPR’s annual operating budget. Much of its funding comes from sponsorships and dues from its member stations around the U.S., which in turn get revenue from a range of funders including public institutions, corporate donors and listeners.

Twitter’s new labels have often appeared arbitrarily assigned. For example, Twitter hasn’t added the “government-funded” label for many other public broadcasting organizations, such as those in Canada and Australia. It also has changed some labels without explanation, such as when it removed a “United Arab Emirates state-affiliated media” tag from the profile of Abu Dhabi’s The National newspaper earlier this year.

In an interview Tuesday with a BBC technology reporter at Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters, Musk acknowledged that the British organization “is not thrilled” about the label it received and asked the reporter for feedback.

“Our goal was simply to be as truthful and accurate as possible,” Musk said. “So I think we’re adjusting the label to be ‘publicly funded,’ which I think is perhaps not too objectionable. We’re trying to be accurate.”

The BBC said Wednesday it would welcome being described as publicly funded instead of government-funded. Hours later, BBC got its “publicly funded media” label, but not NPR or PBS.

The literary organization PEN America said news organizations are making understandable responses to Twitter’s “unpredictable and capricious” policy decisions but the loss to consumers will be significant.

Liz Woolery, PEN America’s digital policy leader, said “Musk’s approach to managing Twitter has come at the expense of information integrity and user trust, and it has only made it harder for users to sift through the maelstrom of online content to find what is credible.”

262,"Rays tie record with 13-0 start, rally to beat Red Sox 9-3","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — After going unbeaten against four teams with losing records, the Tampa Bay Rays headed to Toronto to try setting Major League Baseball’s post-1900 record for consecutive wins at a season’s start.

“We’re a small-market team and people around the league not all the time have great things to say about us, but we play together,” Manuel Margot said through a translator after the Rays beat the Boston Red Sox 9-3 Thursday for a 13-0 start.

Tampa Bay rallied in a seven-run fifth inning that Harold Ramirez began and capped with doubles, and the Rays matched the 13-win start of the 1982 Atlanta Braves and 1987 Milwaukee Brewers.

The only longer opening streak was 20-0 by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons of the Union Association. The Rays have won all but two of the games by four or more runs and have outscored opponents 101-30 with the most runs in the big leagues and the fewest allowed.

“When you do something like that you’re playing really well,” manager Kevin Cash said. “There’s not one part of our game right now that we don’t feel good about.”

Playing before a crowd of 21,175, the largest at Tropicana Field since opening day, the Rays set a team record for winning streak at any point in a season by topping a 12-game run in June 2004. The streak includes series against Detroit, Washington and Oakland.

Boston, held to four hits, has lost 13 consecutive games at the Trop.

“They pitch when they need to pitch. They put the ball in play and they drive guys in,” Christian Arroyo said.

Rays starter Jeffrey Springs left two pitches into the fourth inning with what the team said was ulnar neuritis, inflammation of the ulnar nerve that causes numbness or weakness. He was relieved after throwing a 79.8 mph changeup and a 83.5 mph to Justin Turner, then looking at his hand and elbow.

“The pitch prior, kind of just felt a little bit of something in the elbow, forearm area,” Springs said. “It was kind of hard to pinpoint.”

He said the sensation felt like a shock rather than pain and he planned to get imaging on Friday. Cash said Springs is likely to miss at least one start.

“Hopefully, it’s just a nerve thing that kind of flared up,” Springs said. “I didn’t feel anything pop or anything like that.”

Tampa Bay trailed 3-1 in the fifth against the Red Sox. Ramirez started the big rally with a double off Corey Kluber (0-3) and broke open the game with a three-run double against Richard Bleier.

Francisco Mejía cut the deficit with a run-scoring single and Brandon Lowe greeted Bleier with a tying RBI single.

Randy Arozarena singled for a 4-3 lead, Wander Franco was hit by a pitch and Margot dropped down a run-scoring bunt single.

“I noticed the third baseman, he was playing back,” Margot said of Bobby Dalbec.

Ramirez then lined a double into the left-field corner for an 8-3 advantage.

“When Harold led off with a double, it sparked the lineup. It kind of let everyone breathe a little bit,” Brandon Lowe said.

Lowe added a seventh-inning home run off Kutter Crawford, his fifth this season.

Yandy Díaz tied the score 1-1 in the first with his fourth this season for the Rays, who lead the major leagues with 32. Only the 2019 Seattle Mariners and 2000 St. Louis Cardinals with 33 each homered more through 13 games.

Braden Bristo, a 28-year-old right-hander, pitched three hitless innings with four strikeouts and a walk in his major league debut after seven seasons in the New York Yankees minor league system.

Rob Refsnyder homered in the first, the first run off Springs in three starts this season.

Kiké Hernández hit into a run-scoring groundout in the fourth, an inning that included Triston Casas’s 14-pitch walk against Garret Cleavinger. Justin Turner had an RBI single in the fifth on a soft fly to center that dropped just in front of center fielder Josh Lowe.

The Rays entered averaging 16,770 at hom, ahead of only Oakland, Miami and Kansas City.

Yu Chang is 0 for 12 this season and 0 for 22 since Sept. 22.

Red Sox: RHP Zack Kelly was placed on the 15-day IL after leaving Wednesday night’s game with an elbow injury, and RHP Kutter Crawford was recalled from Triple-A Worcester.

Rays: RHP Taj Bradley, who won his major league debut on Wednesday, was optioned to Triple-A Durham. ... Bristo’s contract was selected from Durham and RHP Shane Baz (Tommy John surgery) was transferred to the 60-day IL.

Rays: RHP Drew Rasmussen (2-0) starts Friday’s series opener at Toronto, which goes with RHP José Berríos (0-2).",0

264,Beckham says he has no assurances on Jackson's status,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Odell Beckham Jr. can’t make any promises about Lamar Jackson’s future, although his preference is obvious.

“The goal was to come here and have that possibility to play with him,” Beckham said. “I didn’t get any assurances for anything. Life’s uncertain. I think we don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, the next day. We only know what’s happened in the past.”

The Ravens acquired Beckham on a one-year deal worth up to $18 million including $15 million guaranteed. That agreement led to some obvious questions: Was this a sign that Beckham knew Jackson would be the quarterback in Baltimore this season? Or would the addition of the star wide receiver make it easier for the Ravens to keep their franchise quarterback?

There was even a screenshot on Instagram that appeared to be Jackson and Beckham on a video call.

“I don’t know if he called me, I called him or whatever,” Beckham said Thursday at his introductory news conference with the Ravens. “He just was excited about it, excited about the opportunity, the possibility.”

Right now that’s still a possibility and not a certainty. The Ravens used the franchise tag on Jackson, who then announced that he’d requested a trade in early March. Unlike at their pre-draft news conference earlier this month, the Ravens didn’t try to shut down questions about Jackson on Thursday.

“I have not talked to Lamar since the signing (of Beckham). There’s been interaction along the way,” general manager Eric DeCosta said. “Lamar’s in our plans. We love Lamar. Our feelings about Lamar have not changed one bit since the end of the season. We’re hopeful still that we’ll get a long-term deal done. He’s the right player for this team to lead us to where we want to be.”

As for whether Jackson wants to return — in light of his trade request — DeCosta said there has been communication since then.

“It would probably be not smart on my part to talk about those details, because Lamar and I have decided together that we weren’t going to discuss that stuff personally,” DeCosta said. “In saying that, as I said, we only think of Lamar as the quarterback of this team, and we’re hopeful to get a deal done.”

Signing Beckham represents a change for the Ravens this offseason. Baltimore used first-round draft picks on receivers Marquise Brown in 2019 and Rashod Bateman in 2021, but the Ravens traded Brown last year and didn’t bring in any significant veterans to replace him. Then Bateman was limited to six games by foot problems, and Baltimore was left with a substandard group of wideouts by the end of the season.

Now the Ravens have aggressively tried to fix that by bringing in Beckham.

“We’ve tried in the past. This isn’t the first time we’ve tried to do that,” DeCosta said. “Sometimes you succeed, sometimes you don’t.”

The 30-year-old Beckham did not play last season following ACL surgery. He began his career with the New York Giants and most recently played for the Los Angeles Rams, which led to a question about going from those two massive markets to Baltimore.

“Well, I was in Cleveland.” Beckham said, referencing his 2019-21 stint with the Browns. “Not the biggest of cities.”

When Beckham was in Cleveland, he worked with offensive coordinator Todd Monken, whom Baltimore recently hired to fill that role.

Beckham also talked a bit about Jackson’s situation from a player’s perspective.

“I’ve been in contract negotiation. I’ve been on the side where you’ve worked your entire life for one, first, to get to the NFL. Then the second-most important thing is to take care of your family and get your contract. It’s a very thin line when it’s your heart that’s involved and you are a personable person and you feel like you’ve done so much and you deserve this, and then the business side gets in the way,” he said.

“It’s just the nature of the business that we’re in. It’s very tough. It’s no written script for it, or how to handle it or how to deal with it. But I could definitely tell that he was excited about the opportunity to be able to get to work, if that does present itself. Obviously, he’s who I would love to play with.”",0
265,Hovland leads RBC Heritage; Masters champ Rahm struggles,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S. C. (AP) — Viktor Hovland’s round of 7-under 64 at the rain-delayed RBC Heritage on Thursday gave him a first-round lead for a second straight week — and left Masters champion Jon Rahm eight shots behind and with plenty of work ahead to get into contention after his major victory.

Hovland had the lowest of his five career rounds Harbour Town, the tight, tricky Pete Dye layout.

The Norwegian was a stroke ahead of Brian Harman. Jimmy Walker and Aaron Rai were also at 6 under but had not completed their rounds when play was suspended because of darkness at 7:50 p.m. Six players will conclude their first rounds on Friday morning.

The group at 66 included U. S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, Ryder Cup captain Zach Johnson, Justin Rose, Sungjae Im, Scott Stallings and Joel Dahmen.

Rahm, who slipped on his first green jacket just a few days earlier, finished at 1-over 72. He acknowledged the fatigue from Augusta National, and it didn’t help that his afternoon included a rain delay of nearly 90 minutes. He never got comfortable on a course he had competed on only once before.

“I hate to make excuses, but a couple of the swings towards the end were my body being tired and surprised me,” Rahm said.

The RBC Heritage is the sixth designated event this year on the PGA Tour, meaning an increased purse — up to $20 million from $8 million a year ago — and many of the world’s best, like Rahm and Hovland, in the field when they may have otherwise taken a post-Masters break.

Hovland, like Rahm, had only played here in June 2020 when Harbour Town hosted the tour’s second event after its COVID-19 stoppage. But the lack of experience didn’t slow him down as he birdied seven of his final 14 holes. Hovland shared the first-round lead at the Masters and finished in a tie for seventh.

Hovland missed birdie putts inside 15 feet on three of his first four holes but didn’t lose confidence in his stroke.

“Instead of freaking out or questioning all the reads that you make, that’s not going to fix anything,” he said. “So I just kind of kept trusting the process.”

Rahm was cheered loudly as he got to the first tee and was the focus of cellphone cameras as he moved around Harbour Town. He showed quickly he was not quite recovered from meat-grinder of Augusta National.

His drive on the par-5 second hole was way left and he needed two chips to save par. On the fifth, another par-5, Rahm was gesturing with his hands when his putt didn’t go where he planned. After the mid-round delay, Rahm bogeyed the sixth, seventh and eighth holes.

He received a big ovation by fans in the stands alongside No. 8, but after his tap-in for bogey, Rahm didn’t pause and headed straight for the ninth tee before playing partner Jordan Spieth putted out. Spieth, the defending champion, shot 68.

Rahm made consecutive birdies on the 13th and 14th holes. But things turned again on No. 16 when his drive went into a bush in a waste area. He took a penalty drop and made his fourth bogey of the day.

“I’m hoping tonight is the day where I start turning things back around and start feeling a little bit better,” Rahm said.

Harman is from nearby Savannah, Georgia, and has played this event for 12 straight years. He missed the cut at the Masters, then took the weekend off and didn’t touch a club until arriving on Hilton Head.

“I killed a pig Friday night at my farm, and I killed a turkey Saturday morning,” Harman said. “I didn’t hit any balls until I got here Tuesday.”

His hands-off preparation appeared to work well as he had six birdies without a bogey to tie his lowest career round at Harbour Town.

After a week where PGA Tour and LIV Golf players were together, it was back to separate sides of the globe. Dustin Johnson was the most prominent member of the Saudi-funded tour who regularly played Harbour Town. Johnson is a South Carolina native and had an endorsement deal with RBC.

LIV Golf’s next event in April 21-23 in Adelaide, Australia.

266,"Biden taps Gaga, Clooney, Garner, others for arts committee","WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House on Thursday announced a star-studded slate of members for the President’s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, a panel of artists, museum professionals, academics and philanthropists that serves as an advisory board to President Joe Biden on culture issues.

The group will be co-chaired by Bruce Cohen, an Academy Award-winning producer known for films such as “American Beauty” and “Silver Linings Playbook,” and pop megastar and Grammy Award winner Lady Gaga, also known as Stefani Germanotta, according to the White House.

Others tapped to the committee include musician Jon Batiste, who performed at the White House state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron in December, television producer Shonda Rhimes, Grammy Award winner Joe Walsh, and actors George Clooney, Jennifer Garner, Troy Kotsur and Kerry Washington. It also includes one former member of Congress: Democrat Steve Israel, who represented New York in the House.

Tsione Wolde-Michael, the committee’s executive director, says it is “positioned to do meaningful work that will positively impact the arts, libraries, museums, and public humanities work in communities across the country.”

Many of the members appointed to the arts and humanities committee have previously partnered with Biden on key issues, such as Gaga on the “It’s On Us” campaign to battle sexual assault on college campuses. Veteran television producer Marta Kauffman, who was also selected for the committee, hosted first lady Jill Biden at her home for a fundraiser in September.",0
267,Scorsese waltzes with David Johansen in 'Personality Crisis',"NEW YORK (AP) — Martin Scorsese was knee-deep in preparation for “Killers of the Flower Moon” when Mara Hennessey reached out to invite him to see David Johansen. The former frontman for the trailblazing 1970s proto-punk band the New York Dolls — and Hennessey’s husband — was performing a new show at the Café Carlyle.

Scorsese, a longtime fan of Johansen (he had once played the Dolls to rile up his actors for a fight scene), went eagerly with a handful of others, including his frequent documentary collaborator David Tedeschi. There, they saw Johansen perform a lounge act of grit and grace.

Here was a downtown fixture relocated to one of uptown’s swankiest rooms. As his pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, Johansen was performing stripped-down versions of his own songs and Dolls hits, with plenty of reflective, comic interludes. Scorsese, smitten by Johansen’s performance, immediately resolved to shoot it — the still ringing echo of a vanished New York.

“It was just a natural feel: We have to do this,” Scorsese explained in an interview. “We have to capture it before it goes.”

“Personality Crisis: One Night Only,” which debuts Friday on Showtime, is the result, mixing footage Scorsese and co-director David Tedeschi shot over two nights at the Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through Johansen’s wildly varied career and intimate interviews taped during the pandemic by Johansen and Hennessey’s daughter, Leah.

Like Scorsese’s recent Netflix series “Pretend It’s a City” with Fran Lebowitz, it’s also a portrait of a still clarion, still vibrant New York voice in a city that now hardly resembles the one they were all forged in.

“The environment that he came out of in the ’70s, in a way, I’m still there,” says Scorsese, whose third feature film, “Mean Streets,” debuted the same year as the Dolls’ first album. “It has to do with New York because we live in New York. I’m not doing L. A. I’m not doing Chicago. I live in New York. And this is a part of where I came from. It turns out that it’s changed, it’s finished, it’s gone, it’s going somewhere else.”

Time is much on the mind of Scorsese, 80, who in a month will debut at Cannes “Killers of the Flower Moon,” his sprawling adaptation of David Grann’s bestseller about a series of murders of members of the Osage tribe in 1920s Oklahoma. The scope of the Apple release — with a budget of $200 million and a reported runtime of nearly four hours — makes it one of Scorsese’s biggest undertakings.

“It’s not four hours,” he says. “It’s lengthy. It’s an epic.”

Adding in “The Irishman,” Scorsese’s ambitions seem to be only growing with age. Bigger productions, he says, are what he’s aiming toward now — even if he’s less accustomed to directing the movement of mass groups of people the way Steven Spielberg or Ridley Scott can.

“They just snap their fingers and it happens. But I can’t. Maybe I could,” says Scorsese. “Something else happens. If the character finds himself in a story that takes a longer period of time to tell, then I feel comfortable with that. And I think there’s an audience for that. Or I should say I think there’s still an audience for that.”

Other big projects may loom, Scorsese says.

“If I get there,” he says. “You got to get there.”

All of which makes “Personality Crisis,” sandwiched between two monumental masterworks, a stirringly intimate contrast.

“I was surprised by how much I liked it,” says Johansen. “I hardly cringed.”

The Staten Island-born Johansen, now 73, was a pivotal figure of ’70s East Village New York and the New York Dolls presaged the punk movement. Since then, he’s reinvented himself as the lounge-singing Buster Poindexter, who had the 1980s hit “Hot Hot Hot” (a song that Johansen now more or less disowns). He’s acted, too. Many will remember Johansen as the taxi-driving ghost of Christmas past in “Scrooged.”

Part of the joy of “Personality Crisis” is that it takes Johansen — so often associated with particular eras of rock — out of those contexts. Here, he’s simply a gravel-voiced lounge lizard supreme — a rock ‘n’ roll survivor with the anecdotes to go with it.

“It’s not a rock doc,” says Hennessey. “To me, it’s a portrait of an artist.”

Almost since the beginning, Scorsese has toggled between narrative features and documentaries, though he and Tedeschi don’t love the term “documentary.” (“We’d rather have fun,” says Tedeschi.) Each are simply films, Scorsese says, with different rhythms, choreographies and grammar. And they inform each other, a back-and-forth alchemy that began with 1974’s “Italian American,” a dialogue with his parents released in between “Mean Streets” and “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.”

“These films that David and I do free me to think differently about the narrative films I’m making. The narrative films I’m making are becoming more like novels. These are not quite,” says Scorsese. “Sometimes you get locked in by what’s around you and the way things are supposed to be done. ‘Italian American,’ I just hold the camera on my mother and my father speaking and it was interesting. It changed everything for me.”

“The Last Waltz,” Scorsese’s seminal film with The Band, he says shaped “Raging Bull.” “The Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story” (2019), Scorsese connects with 2016’s “Silence” — both in their way about the performance of a spiritual act.

“Personality Crisis” likewise influenced “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Several songs Scorsese heard while listening to Johansen’s wide-ranging satellite radio show “Mansion of Fun” made it into the movie, including Mamie Smith’s “Crazy Blues.” Charlie Musselwhite plays harmonica alongside Johansen in “Personality Crisis”; he also, by coincidence, is an actor in “Killers of the Flower Moon.”

“They just seem to come together,” says Scorsese of his nonfiction and fiction films.

The same could be said for Johansen and Scorsese. They’ve known each other for decades. Johansen remembers seeing “Mean Streets” when it came out, not knowing anything about the director.

“It was so fundamentally good,” he says, shaking his head. Johansen, though, initially wasn’t thrilled about the idea of a documentary.

“People always ask me, ‘Would you be in this documentary? It’s about punk.’ I would just say nope,” Johansen says. “Because when I see myself in that situation, I feel like, ‘Who is this idiot and where did he come from?’”

But making a film with Scorsese — whose long line of rock ‘n’ roll chronicles includes “George Harrison: Living in the Material World” and the Rolling Stones concert film “Shine a Light” — was an easier call.

“I like him for a lot of reasons but one of the reasons I like him is because he, like myself, finds music so inspiring,” says Johansen.

Johansen and Hennessey first thought about turning the Carlyle concert into an off-Broadway show, but Scorsese said it should be filmed.

“Marty said, ‘Ask my wife. I fall asleep in the theater,’” recalls Johansen.

Scorsese and Tedeschi shot his performances unsure of what shape it would take. Over the pandemic, it morphed into a film, and perhaps the clearest and most unfiltered recording of Johansen yet. (A soundtrack is forthcoming.)

“I used to think about my voice like: ‘What’s it gonna sound like? What’s it going to be when I do this song?’ And I’d get myself into a knot about it,” says Johansen. “At some point in my life, I decided: ‘Just sing the f----ing song. With whatever you got.’ To me, I go on stage and whatever mood I’m in, I just claw my way out of it, essentially.”

Scorsese, too, has been trying to persevere without compromise in a sometimes unhospitable environment for cinema. Along with his extensive efforts to preserve and restore old films with the Film Foundation and attempts to bring classic films to new audiences with the Restoration Screening Room, Scorsese has often publicly spoken against the predominance of blockbusters in today’s moviegoing.

“I did a film (‘The Irishman’) with Netflix. That was a great experience. The same with Apple — even more so because we’re going theatrical,” he says of the film to open in theaters Oct. 20. “The experience watching at home is OK. It’s OK. But it’s not what it should be.”

He worries that a generation will grow up with the idea that a theatrical movie is a blockbuster, and everything else is “alternative cinema.”

“Who said movies were going to be made like they were in the first 75, 80 years? Because they were made for theaters,” says Scorsese. “That may not be the case anymore. It’s a new world.”

But Scorsese is still holding out hope. He’d like to see streaming companies build theaters.

“Maybe these new companies might say: Let’s invest in the future of the new generations for creativity,” Scorsese says. “Because a young person actually going to see a film in the theater, that person, who knows, five or 10 years later could be a wonderful novelist, painter, musician, composer, filmmaker, whatever. You don’t know where that inspiration is going to land when you throw it out there. But it’s got to be out there.”",0
268,First image of a black hole gets a makeover with AI,"NEW YORK (AP) — The first image of a black hole captured four years ago revealed a fuzzy, fiery doughnut-shaped object. Now, researchers have used artificial intelligence to give that cosmic beauty shot a touch-up.

The updated picture, published Thursday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, keeps the original shape, but with a skinnier ring and a sharper resolution.

The image released in 2019 gave a peek at the enormous black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, 53 million light-years from Earth. A light-year is 5.8 trillion miles. It was made using data gathered by a network of radio telescopes around the world, showing swirling light and gas.

But even with many telescopes working together, gaps remained in the data. In the latest study, scientists relied on the same data and used machine learning to fill in the missing pieces.

The resulting picture looks similar to the original, but with a thinner “doughnut” and a darker center, researchers said.

“For me, it feels like we’re really seeing it for the first time,” said lead author Lia Medeiros, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in New Jersey.

By having a clearer picture, researchers hope to learn more about the black hole’s properties and gravity in future studies. And Medeiros said the team plans to use machine learning on other images of celestial objects, including possibly the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

269,"In 'Florida Man,' Edgar Ramirez 'has fun with' popular meme","Edgar Ramirez says his new series “Florida Man,” now on Netflix, may share a name with the popular meme of the same name, but it is not making fun of the state or its residents.

“It does not make fun of that, it has fun with it, which is completely different,” said Ramirez in an interview.

In “ Florida Man ” — the TV show — Ramirez plays Mike Valentine, an ex-cop in Philadelphia who falls from grace because of a gambling addiction. He also still owes a big debt to a local mob boss (Emory Cohen) so he often has to do his dirty work. On his orders, Ramirez’s character begrudgingly returns to his home state of Florida to track down his boss’ runaway girlfriend (Abbey Lee). What he intends to be a quick trip turns into a wild treasure hunt that opens up a Pandora’s box about his past.

“It is funny, but it’s dark. It’s offbeat, it’s strange, it’s weird,” Ramirez said. “The absurdity of the situations is where the comedy lies.”

He says Valentine is one of those people who believes he innocently finds himself in absurd situations — but in reality, he courts it.

“He’s very dramatic. I think that he foolishly thinks the way to get out of chaos is by creating more chaos. He believes that he can outrun the ghosts of his past,” he said.

Despite its title, “Florida Man” is filmed in North Carolina. To get a feel for Florida, Ramirez spoke to the show’s creator, Donald Todd, who is from there. He also traveled to the state.

“I went to the places that inspired the story ... to look at the characters, the atmosphere in the air and the mood that inspired the show,” he said.

Before he ever went into acting, Ramirez worked in journalism in his home country of Venezuela and says that desire to learn about people and things is still within him, and serves him today.

“Maybe it has to do with my journalistic background, you know? I’m interested in the human experience. I’m a very curious person,” he said. “That curiosity is the driving force of everything that I do, not only as an actor, but in other interests that I have.”

The actor — whose past roles include “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Carlos” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” says the fun of “Florida Man” set him up mentally to go into his next job, now filming: season two of Peacock’s anthology series “Dr. Death.” It’s based on the podcast of the same name. Ramirez will play the con man masked as a world-renowned surgeon whom a TV producer falls for, based on a true story. He says that role is “one of the darkest” he’s ever had.

“We see it a lot, especially when women are conned. ‘How could she fall for that? Oh, my gosh. She’s so naive’ and all of that. It’s almost like they’re being blamed,” he said. “The reality is they’re people who dedicate their entire life to con other people, so it’s not the victim’s fault.”",0
270,Tech consultant charged in killing of Cash App founder Lee,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A tech consultant was arrested and charged with murder Thursday in the stabbing death of the gregarious and popular Cash App founder Bob Lee last week in downtown San Francisco, authorities said.

Nima Momeni, 38, and Lee, 43, knew each other, San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said at a news conference, but he declined to elaborate on their connection. Momeni was taken into custody Thursday morning in Emeryville, a San Francisco suburb, and booked on suspicion of murder.

The stabbing death of Lee shocked the tech industry, with friends and former colleagues mourning the demise of a brilliant and generous man. Police found Lee with stab wounds in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at 2:30 a.m. April 4. He died at a hospital.

Scott declined to give details on how they linked the killing to Momeni. The chief also refused to disclose a possible motive. Investigators served search warrants in San Francisco and Emeryville. Scott would not say whether a weapon has been found.

San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement that Momeni has been charged with murder in Lee’s death and is expected to be arraigned Friday. Prosecutors will ask a judge to hold him without bail, she said.

It was not immediately clear whether Momeni has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

On his LinkedIn profile, Momeni describes himself as an “IT Consultant/Entrepreneur” as well as the owner of a company called Expand IT. Business filings with the state list Momeni as the chief executive officer, secretary and chief financial officer of Expand IT INC, described as an information technology consulting business. He signed the filing in August 2022.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Momeni has been “a dedicated technology partner since 2005” and that he started Expand IT in 2010.

Criminal records show Momeni was charged with carrying a switchblade in 2011, a misdemeanor offense. The case was dismissed the following year after he took a plea.

Publicist Sam Singer met Momeni about a month ago as Singer has an office next door to Momeni’s live-work loft in the stylish Besler Building Lofts. Singer described Momeni as “very welcoming, warm” and his loft as a “typical Bay Area technology consultant’s office” with a big pool table, gourmet food and high-end stereo system.

Lee is known for creating the widely used mobile payment service Cash App while working as chief technology officer of the payment company Square, now known as Block. He was the chief product officer for the cryptocurrency firm MobileCoin at the time of his death.

Lee was raised in Missouri and had recently moved to Miami with his father, but was back in San Francisco for business when he was killed. Friends described him as adventurous and fearless, and a doting father to his two children.

“I acknowledge and understand how the loss of a young, vibrant leader and innovator has rocked our city and even beyond,” Jenkins said at the news conference.

Lee’s brother, Tim Oliver Lee, posted on Facebook the family’s gratitude to the San Francisco Police Department for catching the suspect. Tim Lee said his brother dreamed of making technology accessible to all and that he made friends from all walks of life.

“Bob loved being in San Francisco, and San Francisco loved Bob. Walking down the street would sometimes be difficult because every young person with a dream would search him out, and he would make time for every one,” his brother wrote.

After Lee’s killing, prominent tech leaders, including tech billionaire Elon Musk, took to Twitter to mourn Lee’s death and blame San Francisco for what they called the city’s lax attitude toward crime.

Musk tweeted at Jenkins, saying that crime in San Francisco is “horrific” and that even when attackers are caught, they are often immediately released.

Mayor London Breed and other top city officials have pushed against that narrative and on Thursday, Jenkins addressed Musk directly.

“I must point out that reckless and irresponsible statements like those contained in Mr. Musk tweet that assumed incorrect circumstances about Mr. Lee’s death serve to mislead the world in their perceptions of San Francisco,” Jenkins said.",0
271,A cyclone-hit Indian hamlet pins its hopes on a sea wall,"KOCHI, India (AP) — Nearly two years ago, Mary Sebastian was hoisted on a chair and carried by a policeman in waist-deep floodwaters, leaving behind her now damaged home where she had spent more than 70 years of her life. She never thought she would return.

So, when Sebastian, now 85, recently recounted her experience during Cyclone Tauktae, which hammered parts of southern India in May 2021, she became emotional as the memories came rushing back. Having returned to the same tiny, tiled-roof home, she expressed hope that a sea wall being erected on the coast just in front of her house would check raging waves of the Arabian sea and keep her safe.

“I feel that at least now we have a shield to protect the coast,” she said. “To stop the waves suddenly hitting the shores and sending it back to the sea.”

“Nothing like that had been here for years,” she added.

Like many native dwellers of Chellanam, a fishing hamlet of 40,000 people in India’s southern state of Kerala, Sebastian is living with fears of many weather events exacerbated by climate change: cyclones, surging seas, flooding and erosion. Tens of millions of people in India, this year expected to become the world’s most populous nation, live along coastlines and thus are exposed to major weather events.

One common adaptation technique, in India and other countries hit hard by rising seas and oceanic storms, is to build sea walls. While they provide a barrier that seas have to get over, scientists and climate adaptation experts warn that such structures can only provide so much protection.

EDITOR’S NOTE: This article is part of a series produced under the India Climate Journalism Program, a collaboration between The Associated Press, the Stanley Center for Peace and Security and the Press Trust of India.

Deadly tropical cyclones like Tauktae and Ockhi a few years before, in 2017, formed in the Arabian Sea, devastated the hamlet and aggravated the existing coastal issues. For years, different parts of Chellanam and surrounding areas have had a patchwork of small sea walls and other methods to try and reduce destruction.

At least 10,000-12,000 residents are affected by the coastal erosion and extreme wave issues every year, according to K L Joseph, former president of Chellanam’s village council.

Joseph said Chellanam has tried other methods to protect homes and people, such as a large project some years ago involving geotubes. Laid along coastlines, tubes made of polymer are filled with sand, thus providing a barrier that is flexible to accommodate waves. But parts of the tubes broke apart, with local news reports recounting how chunks were washed out to sea.

“It failed,” Joseph said of the project.

Less-than-certain protection isn’t the only downside of any kind of sea barrier. Erecting a structure to keep waves in check simply means the water, pushed back to sea, will go somewhere else, potentially creating higher surf in other parts of nearby coastlines, which may not have sea walls. Sea walls also limit, or altogether remove, a beach area. Fishermen in Chellanam have already had to move where they dock their boats.

Joseph Mathew, a Kerala-based coastal protection expert, said the loss of the beach will disrupt Chellanam’s ecosystem. For example, waves hitting the sea wall will be pushed toward the ends of the wall, creating higher surf, and thus erosion, in those areas.

“It denies a permanent ecosystem for beach fauna,” he said. “Creatures cannot survive in a place where waves break constantly.”

For years, Chellanam witnessed intense protests demanding that authorities provide a more permanent solution to protect the shores. Last year, Pinarayi Vijayan, the state’s chief minister, inaugurated a new coastal protection project that included a sea wall made of concrete structures called tetrapods and a network of groynes, low barriers built from the coast into the sea.

Today, heaps of dusty granites and tetrapods, weighing between 2,000 to 5,000 kilograms (4,409 to 11,023 pounds) line broken pathways and vacant plots near the Chellanam coastline, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the port city of Kochi. A chain of six T-shaped groynes is also under construction.

“DANGER. STAY OUT FROM SUSPENDED LOADS,” warns a sign with an image of a stickman potentially being crushed by a tetrapod.

With much of the first phase of the new sea wall completed in a 7 kilometer (4 mile) stretch from Chellanam harbor to Puthenthodu Beach, at least for now residents like Sebastian feel more secure.

She and other family members living with her — a son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren — are still processing painful memories from the cyclone that washed away their savings and many dreams.

In the aftermath, there was nothing but some chunks of previous sea barriers and a fence of sandbags that her son, Esidor Rajan, and some neighbors had filled every year.

All the furniture, silverware and their television were either washed away or destroyed in flooding, his wife Juliet recalled.

“Some noble people gave us their used television, utensils and so on,” she said. “Now, we are surviving with this.”

The family tried to leave the home for good, spending stints with extended family or in relief shelters, but ultimately returned because they couldn’t afford to rent another place.

Today, freshly painted walls of the living room have cracks, fissures and mud marks behind the plastering, subtle remnants of the destructive cyclone.

Memories and remnants of destruction are all around the area.

Reetha Maria, 55, a resident of nearby Kandakkadavu ward, has yet to recover from the frightening sight she came across after the cyclone hit.

“I was shocked to see waves carrying huge granite stones of the old sea wall and tons of water gushing directly to my home. You may have no idea how many days that we took to clean the stinking mud and filth brought by the seawater,” she said.

Hima Rose, 29, showed her balcony garden, where a hybrid mango tree and curry leaf plant among some other such fauna, are planted on colorful pots.

“This is nothing but post-cyclone impact,” she said with a smile. “We don’t want to lose our darling plants to yet another cyclone and high waves. So, we decided to grow them on the balcony. Luckily, we have a two-story house.”

Rose said that after Tauktae, she welcomed neighbors to her home, providing them shelter and food for several days.

Today, construction work on the sea wall is almost complete in Kandakkadavu.

As the sun sets in the evenings, children climb the slanting granite structures and sit atop the tetrapods.

An abandoned one-story house, battered by the cyclone, remains standing just some meters (yards) away from the sea wall, a constant reminder of the harrowing aftermath of the cyclone’s sea surge, displacements and relief camps.

For those who can’t afford to leave their homes, and live and work along the coast, the construction of the sea wall is priceless but not a complete fix, as workers race to finish before the next monsoon, which could be any day now.

Sebastian, a fisherman who is in his late seventies who only gave his first name, summed up the cautious optimism many are feeling.

“We can be confident about the new sea wall only after another mighty cyclone like Tauktae hits the shore,” he said.",0
272,Progress in identifying Tulsa massacre victims,"A forensic anthropologist believes investigators are a step closer to identifying victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre with the discovery of 19 surnames possibly connected to remains excavated from a Tulsa cemetery.

Although the six bodies associated with the names are not confirmed massacre victims, nor do they show signs of trauma such as gunshot wounds, identifying them would provide a possible roadmap to the most likely areas of the cemetery to search for victims, according to Phoebe Stubblefield.

Identifying the remains would help lead to death certificates that contain the date of death, indicating when the person was buried, said Stubblefield, a member of the team that conducted excavations in the cemetery the past three years.

“We get closer to figuring out who was buried in that cemetery and when,” Stubblefield said.

Investigators could “maybe get the pattern of how people were buried in that cemetery. By that I mean burials for January, burials for February, burials for March, and we’re moving toward June” when massacre victims were buried, said Stubblefield. “We can find a greater concentration of probable victims.”

The massacre occurred May 31 and June 1, 1921, when a white mob descended on Greenwood — the Black section of Tulsa. More than 1,000 homes were burned, hundreds more were looted and destroyed and a thriving business district known as Black Wall Street was decimated.

Most historians who have studied the event estimate the death toll to be between 75 and 300. Historians say many of the victims were buried in unmarked graves, their locations never recorded and rumors have persisted for decades of mass graves in the area.

Two of the 66 sets of remains found thus far have gunshot wounds, officials have said, and those remains are among 10 sets still being analyzed.

Those with gunshot wounds or trauma would indicate the remains were more likely to have been victims of the violence, according to Stubblefield.

City officials and Intermountain Forensics have sought DNA from people who believe they may be a relative or descendant of a massacre victim and others with a historical connection to Tulsa.

That DNA was being compared to samples from the excavated bodies in the effort to identify the remains.

None of the remains have yet been confirmed as massacre victims.

Identifying the surnames helps “move the needle on a more than century-old event,” Tulsa Mayor G. T. Bynum said in a statement. “We are still in the beginning stages of this process. There is a lot more investigative work that is happening.”

Investigators have tracked the surnames associated with the six bodies, four male and two female, to at least seven states: North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alabama.",0
273,Blood sloshes and Nicolas Cage feasts in 'Renfield',"“Renfield” is not Nicolas Cage’s first blush with a vampire.

In 1988′s “Vampire’s Kiss,” he played a New York literary agent who thought he was an immortal bloodsucker. His bug-eyed performance was essentially the birth of the over-the-top, kabuki-inflected mythology of Cage. Years later, it would launch a thousand memes — a kind of digital version of becoming undead.

Thirty-five years later with “Renfield,” Cage is finally playing the genuine article, complete with bloodthirsty fangs and a dapper velvet smoking jacket. Casting Cage, our grandest of ghouls, as Dracula is so predestined that it almost risks being too on the nose. The good news is that, no, he’s perfect as Dracula. The bad news is that Cage’s Dracula is only a supporting role here, making “Renfield” more of a tasty morsel than a satisfying feast.

That’s no discredit to Nicholas Hoult, who plays Bram Stoker’s devoted henchman to Dracula in Chris McKay’s “Renfield,” which opens in theaters Friday. The film, penned by Ryan Ridley, fashions Robert Montague Renfield less as Dracula’s doting, “yes Master” lackey than a distinctive and sensitive person — or kinda person; his supernatural powers are sustained, for some reason, by eating bugs — in his own right. “Renfield,” a fast and loose horror-comedy splattered top to bottom with blood, is about Renfield trying to break free of Dracula’s fearsome sway — “a destructive relationship” as Renfield describes in a self-help group.

It’s a nifty enough idea (Robert Kirkman gets a story by credit) that the filmmakers have wisely chosen not to over complicate. Even though “Renfield” features a monster with growing desires for world domination and an alarming number of exploding human heads, the stakes are low in this Dracula spinoff. The tone is antic and blood-splattery, slotting in closer to a gory, middle-of-the-road “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” episode than, say, the wittier “What We Do in the Shadows.”

Vampires have been in vogue for some time, but usually in more extrapolated interpretations with greater sympathies for vampires — elegant, sexy or childlike — as worldly outsiders. Edging closer to Dracula, himself, has been rarer, and it’s probably a sign of the lesser, shlocky ambitions of “Renfield” that he still remains off to the side. But whenever Cage’s Prince of Darkness is around, the movie has a bite.

Cage, returning to major studio territory after an often thrilling, sometimes befuddling decade in indie pastures, is, as always, fully prepared for the moment. The actor, long a devoted fan of F. W. Murnau’s “Nosferatu,” channels some of the classic interpretations of Dracula — including Bela Lugosi, over whom Cage is superimposed in an early flashback taken from 1931′s “Dracula” — while animating the character with his own comic, campy rhythm. It may be worth the price of admission to see Cage’s Dracula let out a brief “Woo!” while awakening to a new sense of himself as a god.

Yet “Renfield” oddly gravitates away from tapping this rich vein to instead consume the New Orleans-set film with not just R. M.’s bid for personal freedom but a busy plot involving a local crime family and police corruption. Awkwafina co-stars as Rebecca Quincy, an honest traffic cop who wants to avenge her father’s death and bring justice to the Lobo family, a drug-dealing gang led by the matriarch Ella (Shohreh Aghdashloo), with her less sharp son, Teddy (Ben Schwartz), among the lieutenants.

It’s easy to see the purpose in some of this: Bring in some funny people to populate the backdrop for Renfield’s attempted succession from Dracula duties (which consist mostly of bringing him fresh corpses, preferably of more innocent blood). Awkwafina is a welcome presence with her own comedy chops. But by trying to amp things up, McKay, the director of “The Tomorrow War” and “The Lego Batman Movie,” loses what ought to have been the film’s focus.

Still, “Renfield” is enjoyable enough in a disposable sort of way. A lack of self-seriousness is a quality to be appreciated in any movie like this. And Hoult manages to be remarkably sweet while at the same time using human limbs to decapitate other victims. Some of the best scenes are of him sitting in on a support group meeting to talk through toxic relationships. (Brandon Scott Jones, who plays the group’s leader, is quite good.) But “Renfield” never lets Cage really sink his teeth into the movie, leaving us still hungry for more.

“Renfield,” a Universal Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for bloody violence, some gore, language throughout and some drug use. Running time: 93 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",0
274,"India's population, EV sales","As India’s population soars above all, fewer women have jobs

MUMBAI, India (AP) — India will soon eclipse China to become the world’s most populous country, and its economy is among the fastest-growing. But the number of Indian women in the workforce, already among the 20 lowest in the world, has been shrinking for years. It’s not only a problem for individual women, but a growing challenge for India’s own economic ambitions if its estimated 670 million women are left behind as its population expands. The hope is that India’s fast-growing working-age population will propel the nation’s economic growth for years to come. Yet experts worry this could just as easily become a demographic liability if India fails to ensure its rising population, especially its women, are employed.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks were mixed on Wall Street Monday in their first trading after a report heightened speculation the Federal Reserve may tap the brakes again on financial markets and the economy. The S&P 500 gained 0.1%. Big tech stocks were worst off as bets built for the Fed to raise interest rates at its next meeting. That forced the Nasdaq down slightly, but hope still remains that the economy may skirt a recession. That helped the Dow rise modestly. Stocks were catching up to the bond market, where yields rose Friday with expectations for a rate hike.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration will propose strict new automobile pollution limits this week that would require at least 54% of new vehicles sold in the U. S. to be electric by 2030, ramping up quickly to as high as 67% by 2032. That’s according to industry and environmental officials briefed on the plan. The proposed regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency would set greenhouse gas emissions limits for the 2027-2032 model years that would be more ambitious than goals the auto industry agreed to in 2021. Environmental groups are applauding the ambitious numbers, but the plan is likely to get strong pushback from the auto industry.

New BOJ head says banks stable, rules out major policy shift

TOKYO (AP) — The new governor of Japan’s central bank has signaled, once again, that he plans no drastic changes in its ultra-low interest rate policy. Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda said Japan’s financial institutions are not facing the sorts of turmoil seen recently with bank failures in the U. S. and Europe. Ueda pledged to do his utmost to maintain stability in both prices and financial systems Monday. Japan’s central bank is seeing its first leadership change in a decade, at a time when inflationary pressures around the world remain a risk and central banks are fighting back with big interest rate increases. Japan’s benchmark rate remains at minus 0.1%.

Home-based workers became younger, more diverse in pandemic

NEW YORK (AP) — People working from home became younger, more diverse, better educated and more likely to move during the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s according to a report from the U. S. Census Bureau released last week. The report says that, in many respects, the demographic makeup of people working from home from 2019 to 2021 became more like workers who were commuting. The industry groups that saw the greatest jumps in people working from home were information, finance and professional and administrative services. The smallest gains were in agriculture and mining; entertainment and food services; and armed forces.

BEIJING (AP) — Chinese state media say electric car maker Tesla Inc. plans to build a factory in Shanghai to produce power-storage devices for sale worldwide. The reports say Tesla made the announcement at a signing ceremony in Shanghai, where the company operates an auto factory. Plans call for annual production of 10,000 Megapack units. The factory is due to break ground in the third quarter of this year and start productions in the second quarter of 2024.

Unemployment fell to 3.5% under Biden. For how much longer?

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden keeps seeing good economic news and bad public approval ratings. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.5% and more than 236,000 jobs were added in March. But there’s been no political payoff for the president. US. adults are skipping past the jobs numbers and generally not feeling good about the economy. To explain that pessimism, White House aides cite high inflation, the hangover from the pandemic and Republicans’ belief that the economy is sour whenever there’s a Democrat in the White House. The challenge for Biden might be the expectation that unemployment will get much worse this year. The fear is that interest rates have to rise in order to beat inflation.

CUCHARA, Colorado (AP) — Under the gaze of the imposing Spanish Peaks in southern Colorado, the 50-acre Parker-Fitzgerald Cuchara Mountain Park is the story of so many American ski areas, only the community was determined to change the script. Ski resorts boomed in the 70s and 80s, emerging even in areas that didn’t have the climate or workers to sustain them long-term. First-time ski resort owners took on debt and quickly filed for bankruptcy after a bad snow season. But some communities including Cuchara one are now finding a niche, offering an alternative to endless lift lines and sky-high ticket prices. They’re reopening, several as nonprofits, offering a mom-and-pop experience at a far lower cost than mountains run by corporate conglomerates.",0
275,Arty movie 'Showing Up' about artists fails to spark,"Michelle Williams plays a sculptor whose hot water heater has irritatingly busted in the languid “Showing Up.” That’s about it, plot-wise. Talk about nobody showing up.

Director Kelly Reichardt, who also penned the film with her regular screenwriter, Jonathan Raymond, has created a tiresome bubble inside a bubble, focusing their lens to pointless effect on a group of low-level artists in Portland, Oregon.

Everyone seems self-involved and egotistical. Jealousy and microaggressions are the currency here. Who is eating too much free cheese at a tiny gallery opening is an actual key point of contention. It’s like a New Yorker cartoon come to life.

At the center is Williams, working on a a fourth Reichardt film, who has entered a de-glamorizing machine and come out the other end as spectacularly dowdy, with a functional haircut, ill-fitting skirts, arms heavy at her sides, beige ankle-length socks and, gasp, Crocs.

Her Lizzy is desperate to get to working on her rustic ceramic figurines, but real life nuisances intrude, like her job, even though it’s a cushy desk spot at an art institute and her mom is the boss. Her brother’s mental health is spiraling, but she secretly resents him because he is considered a better, visionary artist. Even feeding her cat — Oscar candidate for Best Onscreen Kitty — seems to cause angst.

One begins to wonder if Reichardt and Raymond really even like their main protagonist. She’s a passive-aggressive wimp, someone who when told what she wants can’t happen yet will angrily rip up your flower bed or leave nasty voicemails when she knows you’re occupied. “You’re not the only one with a deadline,” she will whine.

When an ailing pigeon enters her life — see previous mention of Oscar-nominated cat — Lizzy is not compassionate. “Go die somewhere else,” she tells it. This becomes less a Christopher Guest-like satire about the art world than a sly send-up of artsy Bohemians who would rather sway on a tire swing than fix stuff.

There are more interesting people here than sour Lizzy, like old classmate and landlord Jo (Hong Chau) and Eric, the school’s amenable kiln master (André Benjamin, a.k.a. André 3000). Judd Hirsch continues his resurgence — he was nominated for an Oscar opposite Williams in “The Fabelmans” — in another art lover role. And Portland also comes alive — the charmingly weedy streets, ill-fitting fences and crumbling buildings.

Some of the more lovely moments in the movie are watching battalions of young people eagerly making their art — photography, silkscreens, weavings, painting, pottery and installations — at the Oregon College of Art and Craft. It’s crushing to find out later that it was closed in 2019. Why lie? For art’s sake, we suppose.

Reichardt has built a reputation for carefully observed, granular vistas of people struggling through life, but here is a heroine who can’t win us over. Lizzy lovingly gazes at her own work, though where her impulses come from is never explored.

Williams’ portrait is not sweetly curmudgeonly or sweetly neurotic but downright petty. Lizzy resents other artists’ success and knows the price of everything — $3.99 for a bag of birdseed — but the value of nothing.

“Showing Up” may be a rallying cry to let artists just be artists — Reichardt is famously an artist in residence at Bard College, in large part to have health insurance — but she may have miscalculated how much compassion is generated by a supposed lover of beauty who is as cold and off-putting as her figurines.

“Showing Up,” an A 24 release that opens Friday in theaters, is rated R for brief nudity and swear words. Running time: 108 minutes. One star out of four.

276,Australia's most powerful cyclone in 8 years to cross coast,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A tropical cyclone nearing Australia is forecast to be the most powerful storm in eight years to hit the country, bringing wind gusts of up to 315 kilometers (196 miles) per hour as it crosses the northwest coast, meteorologists said Thursday.

Cyclones are common along the sparsely populated Pilbara coast of Western Australia state and fatalities are rare, but authorities fear that Cyclone Ilsa’s extraordinary wind speeds could take some in its path by surprise.

Ilsa reached the highest Category 5 intensity Thursday over the Indian Ocean and is expected to maintain that destructive level as it crosses the Pilbara coast by early Friday, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said.

Category 5 cyclones have mean wind speeds exceeding 200 kph (124 mph) with gusts exceeding 280 kph (174 mph). They typically cause widespread destruction, the bureau said.

The last Category 5 storm to cross the Australian coast was Cyclone Marcia in 2015. Marcia caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage in the east coast state of Queensland.

In 2019, Category 5 Cyclone Veronica did not cross the Pilbara coast, but damaged infrastructure and disrupted the region’s mining and offshore gas industries.

Ilsa is expected to cross the coast somewhere in a 220-kilometer (137-mile) span between the iron ore export town of Port Hedland and Wallal Downs Station, a 200,000-hectare (500,000-acre) cattle ranch to the east.

Those close to where Ilsa makes landfall will experience gusts of up to 315 kph (196 mph), the bureau said.

The storm’s expected landfall is near the remote Pardoo Roadhouse and Tavern where manager Will Batth planned to shelter.

“We haven’t had any as strong as this in many years. This is a big one,” Batth said. “There’s no point in worrying. I can’t stop it.”

On Thursday, police closed the highway along the Pilbara coast between Port Hedland and the tourist town of Broome, 610 kilometers (380 miles) to the northeast, to prevent motorists from risking the worsening conditions. Authorities expect the North West Coastal Highway will be impassable due to flooding before Ilsa passes.

Port Hedland and Broome are the largest population centers in the Pilbara region with 16,000 and 15,000 people respectively.

Bidyadanga, home to around 700 people midway between Wallal Downs Station and Broome, stocked enough food and fuel by Thursday to last a week in case the community is isolated by floodwater. Bidyadanga CEO Tania Baxter said maintaining the community’s electricity would be critical to how they weather the storm.

“Without power, we haven’t got water and possibly even communications,” Baxter said. “So if we can maintain power supply, then we’ll be fine. We’ll manage everything else that comes with it and any damage that comes.”

Many in the cyclone’s path have evacuated in recent days. In Port Hedland, from which the world’s largest bulk export port sends Australian iron ore around the globe, evacuation centers have opened to people whose homes might not withstand the storm, Mayor Peter Carter said.

“Everyone is on edge,” Carter said. “They understand that cyclones are what they are. They’re very, very unpredictable.”

Long-term Port Hedland resident Julie Arif, who has experienced several cyclones, said she was concerned for those in Ilsa’s path.

“They’ll be prepared and riding it out. But it is still terrifying, absolutely terrifying,” Arif said. “When you’re inside in a house and there’s just the roar of the wind outside and thumping and banging and crashing. And cyclones happen at nighttime. You don’t know what it is and it’s frightening.”

The weather bureau warned of damaging winds, flooding rain and abnormally high tides along the Pilbara coast as Ilsa passes.

Many people in the Pilbara region are involved in the mining and cattle industries or are tourists taking advantage of the school vacation period that began this week.

This story corrects that the most recent Category 5 cyclone to cross Australia’s coast was Marcia in 2015, not Yasia in 2011.",0
277,Biden in Ireland encourages nations to 'dream together',"DUBLIN (AP) — Holding up his family history as an example, President Joe Biden on Thursday told lawmakers in a packed parliament building that the story of Irish immigrants setting sail for the U. S. is at the very heart of “what binds Ireland and America together.”

“Like so many countries around the world, though perhaps more than most, the United States was shaped by Ireland,” Biden said in address to a joint sitting of the Oireachtas in Leinster House. “And the values we share remain to this day the core of the historic partnership between our people and our governments.”

Biden stressed the importance of economic ties, a Fearghaíl,united front on the war in Ukraine and a shared urgency to manage climate change. Biden addressed parliament as part of his four-day trip to Ireland and Northern Ireland, where he also met with political leaders and took a whirlwind tour of his ancestral homeland.

Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, speaker of the Dail, parliament’s lower chamber, told Biden that Ireland has benefitted “immensely” from American investment, and noted that it goes both ways — Ireland is the ninth-largest source of foreign direct investment in the U. S.

“Long may this bilateral investment continue,” Ó Fearghaíl said to cheers. He welcomed Biden “home” as he introduced him. Biden was the fourth U. S. president to address the Irish parliament, after John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.

For Biden, Ireland has been the backdrop for discussion about his favorite themes, like dignity, “possibilities,” democracy — and poetry. He addressed parliament on what would have been the 84th birthday of his favorite poet, Seamus Heaney. Ó Fearghaíl gave Biden a signed copy of Heaney’s poems, and Heaney’s widow was present for the speech, watching as Biden quoted “The Cure at Troy.”

The president spoke with poetic flourishes about how the two nations could “dream together over horizons we can’t see.” He talked about visiting County Louth this week, gazing out at the sea from the stone balcony of Carlingford Castle, which would have been the last Irish landmark that Owen Finnegan, Biden’s maternal great-great-grandfather, saw before sailing for New York in 1849.

“These stories are at the very heart of what binds Ireland and America together,” he said. “They speak to a history, defined by our dreams.”

The 80-year-old Biden also reflected on his age, something he rarely does publicly. He said was “at the end of my career, not the beginning.” He told the Irish lawmakers “you can see how old I am,” saying he comes to the job more experienced than any other president in American history.

“It doesn’t make me better or worse, but it gives me few excuses,” he said. Biden is expected to run for reelection, and would be 82 were he to start a second term.

Earlier Thursday, Biden met with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, praising the nation for its humanitarian work welcoming Ukrainian refugees. Ireland has hosted nearly 80,000 refugees from Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, and it has been staunchly supportive of U. S.-led efforts on the war. Biden said he was impressed by Ireland’s commitment.

“I think our values are the same,” Biden told Varadkar. “And I think our concerns are the same. So I’m really looking forward to continuing to work with you.”

Biden also met with with Irish President Michael D. Higgins at his grand Dublin residence. The two octogenarian leaders clasped hands and laughed as they walked inside along a red carpet. Biden signed the guest book with a writerly missive for Ireland’s poet-president: “As the Irish saying goes, your feet will bring you where your heart is. It’s an honor to return.”

Biden helped shovel dirt around a freshly planted Irish oak, not far from one planted years earlier by then-President Barack Obama. He also rang the Peace Bell, unveiled in 2008 to mark the 10th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Biden clanged the bell four times, including one “for all my Irish ancestors, and a fourth one for peace.”

Then he thanked Higgins, who turns 82 next week.

“I’m feeling great, and I’m learning a lot,” Biden said at Higgins’ estate. “I know it sounds silly, but there’s many Irish-Americans, like my relatives, who’ve never come back here.”

Varadkar and Biden also exchanged toasts at a dinner banquet at Dublin Castle.

Biden opened the trip earlier this week in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he marked the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement that ended years of sectarian violence. The U. S.-brokered deal brought peace to a region of the United Kingdom where “the Troubles” left some 3,600 people dead in bombings and other attacks.

Addressing parliament Thursday, Biden said the United Kingdom “should be working closer” with Ireland to support Northern Ireland. His reminder of the importance of maintaining a quarter century of peace in Northern Ireland was likely to irk some British Conservatives and Northern Ireland unionists, who are suspicious of U. S. interference.

Biden arrived in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday, a day after he landed in Northern Ireland. Crowds lined five-deep and waited for eight hours to catch a glimpse of Biden in County Louth, where his mother’s family is from. In the town of Carlingford, the Democratic president toured a castle, gazing out over the sea where his ancestors sailed toward America.

From inside a packed old pub with a sticky wooden floor, Biden acknowledged that his ancestors emigrated to the United States to escape famine, but he added, “When you’re here, you wonder why anyone would ever want to leave.”

The president was elated by the dive into his Irish heritage, which he often cites as a driving force in his public and private life. According to the Irish Family History Centre, Biden “is among the most ‘Irish’ of all U. S. Presidents.” Ten of his 16 great-great-grandparents were from the Emerald Isle.

278,"As profit recession hits, Wall Street hopes it's the bottom","NEW YORK (AP) — Profits are falling for companies, and the only question is how much worse they will get.

Big U. S. companies are lining up to report how much profit they made during the first three months of the year, with the reporting season kicking off in earnest on Thursday and Friday. The widespread expectation is that companies across the S&P 500 will report the biggest drop in earnings since the spring of 2020. That’s when the pandemic was demolishing the global economy.

Still-high inflation, a struggling manufacturing industry and signs of slowdown elsewhere in the economy mean analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report a 6.6% drop in earnings per share from a year earlier. Besides being the sharpest drop in nearly three years, it would also mark a second straight quarter of profit decline for the S&P 500, according to FactSet. That’s something investors call a “profits recession.”

The good news for companies is that many analysts see this as the bottom. They’re forecasting profit declines will moderate from here, before flipping back to growth later this year.

The bad news for companies is many skeptics think such forecasts are way too optimistic.

Many of the forecasts for first-quarter results don’t account for much damage from the banking industry’s struggles. A crisis of confidence last month unleashed massive movements of cash through the banking system, and the worry is that all the turmoil could lead banks to pull back on lending.

That would come on top of already high interest rates meant to drive inflation lower, and it could result in lower hiring, growth and economic activity overall.

“I think we’re unlikely to see anything in the numbers” from banking woes in the first quarter, said Zach Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments. “What we’re really going to be looking for is commentary on the rest of the year” from CEOs” both on the bank side and across a lot of the consumer-facing companies to see where things are on that front.”

Analysts on Wall Street are still forecasting S&P 500 companies will eke out 1% growth in earnings per share over the whole year, versus 2022, according to FactSet.

“That’s way too too high,” said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC Asset Management Group.

The economy has been slowing and may fall into a recession this year. Even mild recessions have historically seen earnings fall roughly 10% from peak to trough, Agati said.",0
279,Northern China blanketed with floating sand and dust,"BEIJING (AP) — Many areas in northern China were blanketed with floating sand and dust on Thursday, and a sandstorm was expected to sweep through parts of Inner Mongolia.

The sandy, dusty weather and strong winds will last until Sunday, the National Meteorological Center said in a statement, adding the public should take precautionary measures to guard against poor air quality.

It renewed a blue alert for sandstorms — the least severe warning in the country’s four-tier weather warning system — and forecast that more than a dozen regions, including major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, would see some areas affected by floating sand and dust on Thursday.

The center’s chief forecaster, Gui Hailin, earlier said the sandy and dusty weather began Sunday in southern Mongolia. As cold air moved southward, the weather spread to various regions including northern and northeast China, he said.

In Beijing, buildings and traffic were shrouded by low visibility. The IQAir website showed an air quality index of 540 for the capital and labeled its air pollution level as “hazardous.” The Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center issued the highest air pollution warning.

Running enthusiast Tu Jiaxian said the sandstorm had a “huge impact” on her life because it interrupted her marathon training plans.

“I want to run but I dare not run because of the weather. That is very painful,” Tu said, adding she had quit her daily 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) jogs for three days this week due to the weather.

Cao Yuanyuan, a newcomer to Beijing, was surprised at first to see the hazy scenes and took photos of them. But the bad weather forced her to wear glasses as a protective measure and keep the windows in her room shut.

“But there is still sand coming in, and I can smell the earth,” Cao said.

280,"Mavs GM Harrison stays guarded on NBA probe, Irving, Doncic","DALLAS (AP) — Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison said he didn’t expect the trade for Kyrie Irving to spark a playoff run the way his first blockbuster move did a year earlier.

Missing the postseason completely started the clock early for the Mavs in their attempt to re-sign Irving in free agency and see how the pairing with fellow All-Star Luka Doncic looks long-term.

The exit interview with Irving was Monday, the day after the season ended under the cloud of an NBA investigation. The league announced the probe after Irving didn’t play and Doncic was limited to the first quarter when Dallas still had a chance to make the play-in tournament with two games remaining.

Irving and Doncic both sat for a meaningless season finale after a loss to Chicago in the game in question eliminated the Mavs a season after they went to the Western Conference finals.

Harrison said Tuesday he didn’t know much about the NBA’s investigation and wouldn’t comment further. The 0-2 finish by Dallas put the club in the best position possible to keep a first-round pick that otherwise will go to the New York Knicks from Dallas’ 2019 trade for Kristaps Porzingis.

The second-year GM wasn’t much more enlightening on the topics of Irving’s future and the mindset of Doncic, who openly expressed his frustration with a losing season and said off-court issues were taking away his joy for the game.

“Had a great conversation,” Harrison said of his postseason meeting with Irving, an enigmatic eight-time All-Star acquired in February after telling Brooklyn he wanted to be traded. The move ended a drama-filled stint with the Nets.

“I think the things that he said along the way about how he feels here, how he feels appreciated, how he feels accepted and allowed to be himself,” Harrison said. “I think those are the things that he’s said kind of consistently, and that’s what gives me the optimism that he wants to be here.”

Doncic said he didn’t agree with, but understood, the decision to sit Irving and four other regulars on the night he played before coming out a few seconds into the second quarter of a 115-112 loss to the Bulls, when a rag-tag bunch of reserves couldn’t hold an 11-point lead in the fourth quarter.

The 24-year-old said in his season-ending interview he was happy in Dallas, and Harrison said he didn’t go to sleep at night worried about Doncic’s future because the four-time All-Star has three years left before a player option kicks in on the $215 million rookie supermax contract he signed two years ago.

Still, there’s the question of keeping Doncic happy in Dallas with plenty of recent scenarios around the league of unhappy superstars forcing their way out.

“I don’t know what keeping Luka happy here means,” Harrison said. “If you win, then I’m assuming he’s going to be happy. If we win and he’s not happy, then I wouldn’t know how to keep him happy. So I think the goal is to win. I’m assuming that works. It will work for me.”

Before the 2022 trade deadline, Harrison sent Porzingis to Washington in a deal that brought Spencer Dinwiddie to Dallas. Dinwiddie was an important piece of the run to the West finals, but he went to the Nets along with defensive ace Dorian Finney-Smith in the deal for Irving.

Harrison said the difference between the outcomes in the two trades was the Mavs were already on a roll when they made the move last year. This year, a team that couldn’t find the same defensive formula got even worse on that end without Finney-Smith, and never found traction.

Doncic and Irving were 5-11 together, with each missing multiple games because of injuries. After winning their first two games with Irving, the Mavs went 7-18 the rest of the way.

“I didn’t know if this would be like a magic pill. I don’t think I had any visions of that,” Harrison said. “But I figured it couldn’t be worse than what it was. I also looked at it as a long-term play, not a short-term play.”

That part is next for Harrison and owner Mark Cuban.",0
281,DeMarcus Cousins joins Guaynabo Mets in Puerto Rican league,"SAN JUAN (AP) — Former NBA All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins joined the Guaynabo Mets of Puerto Rico’s professional basketball league on Tuesday.

The Guaynabo Mets said in a statement that the 32-year-old free agent Cousins “still has what it takes to play in the NBA”, but “is taking his talents to basketball-crazy Puerto Rico.” Details on the contract weren’t immediately available.

“DeMarcus is one of the best basketball players of his generation, and from a talent standpoint, he will be one of the best to ever play” in the Puerto Rican league, Mets co-owner Marc Grossman said. “His ability to shoot and stretch the floor should be a great fit.”

Cousins was the fifth overall pick in the 2010 NBA draft. He most recently played for the Denver Nuggets and Milwaukee Bucks in the 2021-22 season. Cousins also had stints with the Sacramento Kings, New Orleans Pelicans, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers.

Cousins, who played college basketball at Kentucky, averaged 19.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game during his NBA career.

282,A different kind of underdog story in ‘Air’,"The new movie “ Air ” is technically about a shoe. There is nothing especially extraordinary about this shoe. As the Q-like Nike designer Peter Moore (Matthew Maher) explains, the last significant change to footwear was made some 600 years ago when the decision was made to differentiate the right and left feet. The Air Jordan is, at the end of the day, just another shoe.

No one coos about how comfortable it is. No one waxes poetic about its performance enhancing abilities or how many podiatrists recommend it for sporting purposes. No one even tries it on.

That’s because “Air,” directed by Ben Affleck from a smart script by Alex Convery, is not really about the shoe at all. Nor is it about Michael Jordan, who has exactly one line in the film and is mostly seen from behind and in silhouette. It is about the men – and they were all men – of Nike who defied the odds and signed the rookie despite being a very distant third to Adidas and Converse in the basketball sneaker game in 1984.

This is not a sports movie, however. If “Moneyball,” a spiritual cousin to “Air,” was baseball-adjacent, “Air” is about as far away from the game of basketball as one can get. The sport and romance of basketball in “Air” is almost completely beside the point, which is in some ways the most honest way for a couple of Gen-Xers to make a sincere movie about a corporate brand’s biggest success.

“Air” is more “Mad Men,” but without the glamour. In 1984, everything was brown and drab, except for the grape-colored sports car driven by Nike CEO Phil Knight (Affleck, in a comedic role about C-suite eccentricities and ineffectuality). Even the new stuff looked old. There are only so many ways cinematographer Robert Richardson can shoot a corporate office park and series of conversations between men in ill-fitting polos and khakis. But Affleck and his music supervisor do have fun with their conventional but not ineffective needle drops.

The center of “Air” is Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a Nike exec with a basketball scout’s eye for rising talent. He is not, at least on the surface, a slam dunk movie hero. Sonny is out of shape, as the movie reminds us with cruel frequency, he’s middle aged, he doesn’t have a family and he seems to do all his grocery shopping at the gas station. All he has is this job, which isn’t going especially well. And his big idea to bet on Jordan, and Jordan alone, has everyone — Knight; Jordan’s hot tempered agent David Falk (Chris Messina); Nike execs Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman) and Howard White (Chris Tucker); college ball coach George Raveling (Marlon Wayans); and Jordan’s mom Deloris (Viola Davis) — essentially telling him he’s crazy.

One big issue with “Air” is that the dramatic stakes never really quite crystalize or spark excitement in the way that the best movies do when you go in knowing the ending. There are no life-or-death scares or thrilling plane escapes at the end for Affleck to fall back on for tension. Nike was not even an unsuccessful company on the brink of collapse, they just hadn’t cracked the basketball market to the satisfaction of their shareholders yet. It’s hard, as an audience member, to discern whether your own apathy is because you know the outcome or because the story hasn’t convinced you to care enough.

Still, this is movie that also has the potential to get better with time and rewatches. “Air” coasts quite well on its compelling, funny and self-aware script (which even allows room for an amusing disagreement about who exactly came up with the name Air Jordan) and charismatic movie stars. And Damon, who gets one show-stopping monologue, is the perfect actor to carry the film in his first time acting for his old pal. Here’s hoping that the longtime friends make this a habit.

“Air” pivots about halfway through when the Jordans finally enter the picture and, through Davis’ stoic performance, add a much-needed human element. It’s easy to forget that athletes being compensated justly for the value of their image is a relatively new phenomenon. One wonders why the movie couldn’t have mainly been about her and her savvy.

There is an admirably sly subversiveness to the whole endeavor in its refusal to glamourize the shoe, the company or the guys they’ve made a movie about. These are white-collar cubicle dwellers just trying to make it through the week and keep their jobs. I’m not even sure the movie buys into its subjects’ self-written and occasionally contradictory mythologies. Credit to the filmmakers that this is not a TED talk.

How can you be romantic about a billion-dollar shoe company?

“Air,” an Amazon Studios/MGM release in theaters now, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout. Running time: 112 minutes. Three stars out of four.

283,Wall Street bets on better days ahead for US homebuilders,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Homebuilder stocks are on a tear as investors bet that a dearth of previously occupied homes on the market and moderating mortgage rates will boost builders’ prospects in the spring homebuying season.

KB Home, PulteGroup and Tri Pointe Homes are among more than a dozen U. S. homebuilders whose stock price is up by more than 20% this year. One prominent exchange traded fund, the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF, is up nearly 10%. Meanwhile, the benchmark S&P 500 index is up about 7%.

“We think homebuilding stocks may be looking ahead, perhaps crossing the valley from recession to potential recovery in (the second half of) 2023,” CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon wrote in a recent research note.

Builders are coming off a lousy 2022 as mortgage rates skyrocketed to a two-decade high, sidelining many would-be homebuyers. The surge in borrowing costs after years of soaring home prices pulled the housing market into a deep slump. Sales of new U. S. homes fell about 17% last year from a year earlier to the lowest seasonally adjusted annual rate in four years, according to the Commerce Department.

At the expense of less healthy profit margins, homebuilders reduced prices and began offering incentives like covering buyers’ closing costs.

An easing in average mortgage rates this year has also helped entice some buyers. After climbing to an average of 7.08% in November, the rate on a 30-year home loan averaged around 6.37% in the first three months of this year, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.

New home sales rose on a monthly basis in December, January and February, though sales in February were still down 19% from a year earlier.

While many economists project this will be another down year for sales of new and existing homes, some builders are dialing back buyer incentives and raising prices. They’re encouraged by the modest easing in mortgage rates and the prospect of capitalizing on demand this spring at a time when the number of existing homes for sale remains near historic lows.

Consider, from 2000 until the pandemic, new homes represented about 11% of all homes for sale. This year, that’s risen to 27%.

“We’re so far below where we were pre-Covid in terms of existing home inventories, the notion is the builders have a chance to take market share in this environment,” said Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless, who has “Outperform” ratings on several builders, including KB Home, Taylor Morrison and Tri Pointe Homes.",0
284,"New streaming app to 'Max' programming from HBO, Discovery","Warner Bros. Discovery unveiled a streaming service Wednesday combining iconic HBO programming such as “The Sopranos” with a mix of unscripted TV series in a push to reap more subscribers from what so far has been a muddled media merger.

The $16-per-month service, called Max, will be released May 23 in the U. S. and automatically replace the company’s existing HBO Max service in what is being promised as a seamless transition. Max will gradually become available in the rest of the world, with Latin America next up on the slate.

The existing Discovery Plus app featuring reality and unscripted series such as “Fixer Upper” and “Naked and Afraid” from a collection of TV networks will continue to be offered. That’s even as all that programming is made available within the new Max app, which will be marketed with the tagline “The One To Watch.”

The transition comes a year after the completion of a roughly $43 billion deal that spun off the AT&T’s WarnerMedia Division that includes HBO, CNN and TBS into Discovery, whose stable includes the TLC, HGTV, Magnolia and Food networks.

When the deal was announced in 2021, Warner Bros. Discover CEO David Zaslav envisioned it creating “the best media company in the world” backed by a vast library of movies, TV series, documentaries and children’s programming. The goal was to stand out among an array of streaming options competing for subscribers at a time many households are trimming discretionary spending amid stubbornly high inflation.

With Max now on the verge of rolling out, Zaslav said he still sees big things ahead.

“This is our rendezvous with destiny,” he declared during a presentation in the same studio where movies such as “Casablanca” and “A Streetcar Named Desire” were made. Those movies, as well as other Warner Bros. films, will be available in Max, which Zaslav hailed as “the streaming version of must-see TV.” Zaslav hinted that live sports events and news will be added to Max before the end of the year.

Given that the Max app will bring more pedestrian programming from the Discovery networks alongside the boundary-breaking series that have been HBO’s hallmark, Warner Bros. Discovery executives periodically emphasized HBO would remain the same groundbreaking network that recently caused a stir with the series “The Last of Us,” and is currently making waves with the final season of “Succession.”

Toward that end, the company said it would be announcing another offshoot of its most watched series, “Game of Thrones,” and is developing a new live-action “Harry Potter” series featuring a different cast from the popular film franchise based on the books by J. K. Rowling.

Warner Bros. Discovery is hoping the Max app helps turn the tide after a year of turbulence.

Since taking over the combined company, Zaslav has been shedding thousands workers and slashing other expenses to cope with the roughly $50 billion debt that the company took on largely because of the merger. The cost cutting included a decision to pull the plug on CNN’s streaming service a month after its launch in a move that quickly raised doubts about whether the Warner Bros. Discovery deal would turn out to be a flop.

The ongoing skepticism has been reflected in New York-based Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock price, which has dropped by more than 40% since the merger’s completion, including further erosion Wednesday that occurred after the company laid out its plans for the Max app.

Shares in Netflix, the world’s top streaming services, have fallen by 7% during same stretch amid concerns about its own slowing growth, which included a loss of 920,000 subscribers in the U. S. and Canada territory in 2022 that represents its biggest market.

Netflix, which ended last year with 231 million worldwide subscribers, is just one of a bevy of deep-pocketed streamers that the new Max app will be competing against. Other notables include Apple, Amazon, and Walt Disney Co., which offers apps for Hulu TV and ESPN in addition to Disney Plus.

The stiff competition prompted Netflix to introduce a lower-cost streaming plan that includes ads, an option that Max will offer for $10 per month for viewers willing to tolerate periodic commercial interruptions.",0
285,S Korea to conduct 1st launch of commercial-grade satellite,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea plans to conduct its first launch of a commercial-grade satellite aboard a domestically built rocket next month as part of its space development program, officials said Tuesday.

South Korea’s officials say its homegrown Nuri space launch vehicle has no military purposes. But some experts say the development of such rockets would eventually help the country acquire technologies needed to build bigger missiles and launch reconnaissance satellites amid animosities with rival North Korea.

In June last year, South Korea conducted its first satellite launch using the Nuri rocket. That launch involved what South Korean officials called a “performance verification” satellite mainly designed to examine the capacity of the rocket while next month’s event is meant to put a commercial-grade satellite into orbit for the first time.

The Science Ministry said the rocket will blast off from the country’s space launch center on a southern island on May 24. A ministry statement said it had set a backup launch date from May 25-31, in case of possible schedule changes due to weather.

The rocket will carry one main satellite called “Next Generation Small Satellite 2” and seven other smaller cube-shaped satellites. The main satellite is tasked with verifying imaging radar technology and observing cosmic radiation in near-Earth orbit, the statement said.

Authorities have completed the assembly of the rocket’s first and second stages and are conducting final environmental tests of the eight satellites that are to be placed on the rocket’s third stage.

Last year’s launch was the Nuri rocket’s second liftoff. In its first launch in 2021, the rocket’s dummy payload reached the desired altitude but failed to enter orbit. After next month’s launch, South Korea plans three more Nuri rocket launches, officials said.

“The third launch of Nuri is of great significance as it is the first attempt to launch a commercial-grade satellite and the first time a private company will jointly manufacture the homegrown Nuri rocket,” Oh Tae-seok, the first vice science minister, was quoted as saying in the ministry statement.

South Korea, the world’s 10th largest economy, is a major producer of semiconductors, automobiles and smartphones. But its space development program lags behind that of its neighbors China, India and Japan. Since the early 1990s, South Korea has sent a series of satellites into space, but all of them involved foreign rocket technology or launch sites.

North Korea placed Earth observation satellites into orbit in 2012 and 2016, but there is no proof that either satellite has been functioning. North Korea was slapped with international sanctions because of the two launches because the U. N. views them as disguised tests of the North’s banned long-range missile technology.

286,'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is okey-dokey,"April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain. But it is also, if I check the clock, Mario Time.

“The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” with its vistas of primary colors, is here to brighten our dreary springs, T. S. Eliot be damned. That there is a swell of enthusiasm for a Mario Bros. movie is a once-unthinkable development. The last time Mario hit the big screen was in the little-remembered 1993 live-action film with Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi and Dennis Hopper(!) as Bowser. Hoskins called the experience “a f——— nightmare.”

But a lot has changed in the three decades since “Super Mario Bros,” the very first video-game adaptation. A once widely derided genre is now a cash cow. “The Last of Us” is a massive success on HBO. Pokémon and “Uncharted” are box-office hits. With Sonic the Hedgehog already two movies in, Mario is playing catch up.

And “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” which opens in theaters Wednesday, is a spirited and sprightly attempt to race to the front of the pack. A collaboration between legendary video-game designer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination founder Chris Meledandri (both producers), it’s a drastically more sincere effort to capture the fun and spirit of the Nintendo game.

And visually, it’s a dream. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and their animators have rendered the Mario universe with cartoony splendor, matching the game’s ingenious simplicity with a more robust and equally delightful day-glo palate. If part of the appeal of playing “Super Mario Bros.” and its many offshoots has always been to be immersed in such a sunny imaginary world — plus the bouncy earworm compositions of composer Koji Kondo — the movie has successfully mirrored that mushroom-stomping pleasure. It makes you ... want to play Mario.

That’s because as nice as it is to look at “The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” it’s not anywhere near as fun as it would be to play it. It’s a-him, Mario, but it’s no a-masterpiece. The storyline is only a touch above the interstitial bits of plot you usually get between gameplay. With the exception of Jack Black’s grandly lovesick Bowser (he’s part Phantom of the Opera, part Meatloaf-styled balladeer), there’s nothing here that deepens these characters beyond their usual 2-D adventures. Mario may be a modern-day Mickey Mouse but his kingdom is on the console.

“The Super Mario Bros. Movie” begins much like Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing”: in a Brooklyn pizza parlor. There Mario (Chris Pratt, passable despite the outcry) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling to get their plumbing business off the ground. There are a few moments of stereotypical Italian life — pasta and a big family dinner — before the brothers’ attempt to fix a water main break drops them through a portal and into the fantasy realm of the game. (In future Brooklyn-set sequels, Mario will presumably combat waves of strollers and hipsters.)

On the other side, Bowser lords over a Koopa Troop army in scenes that can feel like the most surreal imitation yet of “Triumph of the Will.” But while shrinking or enlarging are possible on this other side of the green pipe, there’s never any mention of the possibility of lives being lost as Mario makes his way through mushroom patches and question-mark boxes. His predicament is just as clear as in the game: He’s been separated from Luigi and he must help save Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) from being forced to wed Bowser.

Game logic often dictates Mario’s movements. The shells of the turtle-like Koopas can be slid around like ammo. And choosing a Mario Kart vehicle is just as difficult a decision. Sometimes, the overlap is less consistent. An invincibility star is the most sought-after item in this adventure, greatly exaggerating its typical usefulness. Those things last for like 10 seconds.

None of this is likely to be enough for anyone to exclaim “Oh, yeah!” while hopping up and down and doffing their cap. But it is an hour and a half’s worth of superlative marketing that will whet your appetite for more Mario back home on the couch. If anything, the — as Mario would say — “okey dokey” “Super Mario Bros. Movie” only reinforces the distance between two wholly different mediums. It may be game-on for video-game adaptations but the Mario main event is still back on Nintendo.

“The Super Mario Bros. Movie,” a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action and mild violence. Running time: 92 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",0
287,UN rights chief seeks help for surge in central Med migrants,"GENEVA (AP) — The U. N. human rights chief has called for an expansion in regular migration channels and search-and-rescue operations after a “steep increase” in the number of migrants and asylum-seekers making risky attempts to cross the central Mediterranean to Europe.

Volker Türk called for solidarity with Italy, which has traditionally received most of the influx, adding that the Italian coast guard had rescued some 2,000 people on the route since Friday. Italy’s right-wing government this week imposed a six-month state of emergency to deal with the situation.

“We are seeing a steep increase in the number of desperate people putting their lives at grave risk,” said Türk, who is the U. N. high commissioner for human rights, in a statement. “We cannot afford to dither, and to become embroiled in yet another debate about who is responsible.”

“Human lives are at stake,” he said, while also urging Italy’s government to scrap a law passed this year that restricts civilian search and rescue operations.

The appeal came a day after the International Organization for Migration announced the reported number of dead and missing along the central Mediterranean reached the highest level of any first quarter since 2017 in the first three months of this year.

The IOM documented 441 migrant deaths along the route during January, February and March 2023, compared with 742 in 2017 and 446 in 2015.

Also Thursday, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was scaling up humanitarian assistance and protection services along the route — including psychological support, first aid, family reunification services and help with disembarkation in Italy.",0
288,Slim pickings for buyers amid near-record low homes for sale,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Americans eager to buy a home this spring, beware: It’s slim pickings out there.

The number of U. S. homes on the market is at near-historic lows, which could dim would-be buyers’ prospects for finding a house or condo and fuel competition for the most affordable properties, economists say.

As of the end of February, just as the spring homebuying season got under way, some 980,000 homes were on the market nationally, according to the National Association of Realtors.

That’s an increase of 15.3% from February last year, when the number of homes for sale sank to an all-time low.

February’s tally of homes for sale translates into a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, according to NAR. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 5- to 6-month supply.

While homebuyers will have more properties to choose from now than last spring, the low supply and sharply higher mortgage rates set the stage for a higher overall price tag for homeownership.

“Buyers are facing a tough market, both in terms of inventory availability and in terms of how that matches up to affordability,” said Hannah Jones, an economic data analyst at Realtor.com.

A big reason there are more homes for sale than a year ago: Properties are taking, on average, nearly twice as long to sell. New listings, meanwhile, were down about 16% in February from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com data.

Homebuyers have had to contend with a shrinking pool of homes for sale for much of the last decade, partly due to underbuilding of new homes since the mid-2000s housing crash and years of ultra-low mortgage rates, which give homeowners less incentive to sell after years of soaring home prices.

“Homeowners aren’t giving up their current house and low monthly payments to join a tight, expensive market,” said Skylar Olsen, chief economist for Zillow.

The last year that the monthly tally of homes on the market averaged more than 2 million was 2015, according to NAR data. That’s steadily declined, reaching 995,833 last year.

Despite the thin inventory of home listings, sales of previously occupied U. S. homes surged 14.5% last month as homebuyers seized on a modest drop in mortgage rates. Sales were down 22.6% from a year earlier, when mortgage rates were, on average, more than 2 percentage points lower.",0
289,Promising new malaria vaccine for kids approved in Ghana,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Ghana on Thursday became the first country to approve a new malaria vaccine for young children, one that officials hope will offer better protection against the disease that kills hundreds of thousands every year.

Final results from late-stage trials have not yet been published, and the vaccine is under review at the World Health Organization. Preliminary results from early testing of the new vaccine, developed at the University of Oxford, have suggested the vaccine is far more effective than the only malaria vaccine now authorized for use by the WHO.

Late-stage testing of the vaccine still is underway in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mali and Tanzania, with results expected later this year.

Results from an earlier trial released last year showed that in children vaccinated in Burkina Faso, the vaccine was up to 80% effective depending how much of an immune-boosting ingredient was included in the shots.

The WHO has already rolled out a pilot program of the world’s first authorized malaria vaccine, piloted in three African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. But that vaccine, sold by GlaxoSmithKline as Mosquirix, is about 30% effective.

That vaccine “is saving lives” in the three pilot countries and has been delivered to over 1.4 million kids, according to Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman.

Jasarevic said its advisory panel on malaria vaccines is reviewing available information on the new vaccine but is waiting for more data about its safety and efficacy from ongoing trials. “Initial results appear promising,” he wrote in an email.

“We would welcome a second malaria vaccine that is safe and efficacious and approved by WHO to complement the roll-out of the first malaria vaccine,” he said.

It’s not clear how soon the new vaccine will be available. Ghana’s Food and Drug Authority approved its use for children ages 5 months to 36 months, the group at highest risk of death from malaria, its developers said in a statement.

Once the new Oxford vaccine is in use, Ghanaian health officials will weigh the “pros and cons before making a final decision” on which one is more effective, said Kwame Amponsa-Achiano the head of Ghana’s immunization program. Ghana is currently using the WHO-approved vaccine.

The new vaccine can be manufactured at large scale and modest cost, its developers say. The Serum Institute of India says it could produce up to 100 million doses depending on demand, which will in turn depend on approval from the WHO.

Ghana’s decision to approve the vaccine quickly was welcomed by health officials on the continent.

″(The) more we wait (the) more we’ll have thousands of children dying from malaria,” said Halidou Tinto, a malaria researcher who is leading the vaccine trial in Burkina Faso.

290,"After last year's stunning failure, bonds show up for safety","NEW YORK (AP) — Suddenly, bonds are again living up to their reputation as the safe part of an investor’s portfolio.

As stocks sank worldwide over the last week on worries about the banking system following the second- and third-largest U. S. bank failures in history, bonds shot up in price. That offered some protection to any investor with a mixed set of stocks and bonds in their portfolio, as most advisers suggest.

Through the middle of March, the largest U. S. bond fund, Vanguard’s Total Bond Market Index fund, returned 2% while the largest U.S. stock fund lost 2.7%. That may not sound like a big deal, but it’s a marked return to form for bonds.

Last year, they were anything but the safe part of a saver’s nest egg. Their prices plunged on fears about the highest inflation in generations and what the Federal Reserve was doing about it.

Inflation by itself makes bonds less attractive because it means the fixed payments they make will buy less stuff in the future as prices rise.

But the barrage of hikes to interest rates instituted by the Fed in hopes of getting inflation under control also inflicted pain. The Fed has vaulted its key overnight rate to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from virtually zero at the start of last year. That helped pull yields higher across the bond market.

When that happens, newly issued bonds making higher interest payments suddenly look much more attractive than the older bonds already sitting in investors’ portfolios. That makes prices in the market for those older bonds drop. And bond funds have to record such changes in price.

What made things worse for investors was that bond prices fell last year at the same time stocks did. The hope in having a diversified set of investments is that some will rise when others fall, keeping the overall portfolio safer. That didn’t happen last year.

This month, though, bonds rallied as worries spread about the banking system following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. That helped to buffer anyone who was also invested in stocks or commodities.

“These are the safe haven assets that are actually acting like safe havens,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “You couldn’t say that last year.”

Of course, the rally means that bonds are carrying lower yields than just a week ago. That means they’ll pay a little bit less in income than before and have a little smaller cushion for future price drops.",0
291,Abortion providers scramble as courts restrict pills,"Doctors, clinics and telehealth providers across the country are scrambling to figure out how they will continue to provide the most common type of abortion after a federal appeals court imposed new restrictions on a key abortion medication.

One telehealth provider would have to shut down for two weeks. Some abortion clinics in Ohio are considering ditching the drug altogether. Meanwhile, other doctors are looking for legal loopholes to dispense the drug, called mifepristone.

People who live far from abortion clinics will be particularly hard hit, abortion rights advocates say. The restrictions could force people to travel hundreds of miles for care and stay for days, said Kirsten Moore, director of the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project.

“This is going to have a severe, severe impact on access,” she said, adding that it will be “devastating” for underserved rural populations.

This is the second time in less than a week that the legal sands have shifted around medication abortions, which account for more than half of abortions in the U. S. The landscape is further complicated by a separate ruling from a judge in Washington state that has ordered access to the drug to be expanded in some states.

The late Wednesday decision narrowed a Texas court judge’s effort to block the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone. It allows patients to keep using the drug, but only at a higher dosage and if patients are seven weeks or fewer pregnant. The decision also prohibits the medication from being sent by mail and requires people to have three in-person visits with their doctor to take the pills. The Department of Justice plans to appeal the decision to the U. S. Supreme Court.

Mifepristone, approved by the FDA in 2000, blocks the hormone progesterone and is also used to treat miscarriages. Millions of women around the world have used the drug, and medical groups say complications occur at a lower rate than with routine medical procedures such as wisdom teeth removal and colonoscopies.

Abortion providers and patient advocates said the restrictions imposed by the court could affect thousands of people if they go into effect on Saturday.

Since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, telehealth abortions have more than doubled, according to a report released this week by the Society of Family Planning. Abortions by virtual clinic telehealth providers rose to 8,540 last December, or 11% of all abortions, compared with 3,610 in April 2022, the report said.

Wisp, a company that provides telehealth medication abortions in nine states, plans to close down for two weeks if the ruling goes into effect on Saturday to switch to a one-drug regimen that uses misoprostol, a medication not challenged in the courts but considered slightly less effective.

Monica Cepak, the company’s chief marketing officer, said they are also looking at providing misoprostol to people who want to stock up on that drug.

“Telehealth remains a really important piece of the accessibility puzzle because as demand for in-person care will likely go up, the time to get an in-person appointment is often 20-30 days, and telehealth fills that really important gap for patients,” she said.

Telehealth abortion providers were already facing restrictions. According to a February report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, six of the states that have not banned abortion have at least one requirement for at least one trip to the clinic.

But order-by-mail abortion provider Aid Access won’t let a U. S. court order stop it from prescribing mifepristone and misoprostol by telehealth, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts wrote in an email.

Gomperts is based in Europe, and the company’s website advertises that it can mail pills to all 50 states in the U. S.

The company has a history of flouting U. S. laws and rules on the issue. In 2019, Aid Access defied an order from the FDA to stop distributing medications in the country.

Some abortion clinics in Ohio may stop dispensing mifepristone entirely by Saturday, said Jessie Hill, an attorney who represents several independent clinics in the state. The state’s law requires doctors to follow federal label guidelines when prescribing mifepristone, which means clinics will have to follow the court’s order. The order will “make it incredibly inconvenient,” to prescribe mifepristone, she said, because patients will have to make three in-person doctor’s visits and pay more for a higher dosage.

The clinics are also considering a misoprostol-only medication abortion method.

In Illinois, operations will continue much the same at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Fairview Heights, Dr. Colleen McNicholas told the Associated Press.

The clinic, which expects to serve about 10,000 abortion patients this year, will continue to provide medication abortions through a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol. The clinic is also in one of 17 states that has sued the FDA to make mifepristone more accessible, and a judge in Washington state on Thursday ordered the FDA not to do anything that might affect the availability of mifepristone in those suing states.

The clinic is further shielded from the ruling because it’s in a state that allows doctors to write prescriptions “off-label,” which gives providers the ability to prescribe a drug in a way that hasn’t been approved by the federal government. McNicholas said the practice is common among physicians with drugs that have long proven to be safe for patients.

Providers in many states can still prescribe mifepristone off-label in places where it’s not prohibited by state law, which means they can offer the drug to patients later in pregnancy than seven weeks, said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia.

But he doesn’t see how they can legally get around the requirement for an in-person appointment.

“It will still be available up to and maybe even beyond ten weeks, depending on what your provider feels comfortable prescribing,” he said. “But whereas before you could have had the pills mailed to you at home ... now, you have to get them in person from a doctor.”

292,Minneapolis to pay $8.9M over Chauvin's actions before Floyd,"The city of Minneapolis agreed Thursday to pay nearly $9 million to settle lawsuits filed by two people who said former police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into their necks years before he used the same move to kill George Floyd.

John Pope Jr. will receive $7.5 million and Zoya Code will receive $1.375 million. The settlements were announced during a meeting of the Minneapolis City Council.

Both lawsuits stemmed from arrests in 2017 — three years before Chauvin killed Floyd during an arrest captured on video that sparked protests worldwide, prompted a national reckoning on racial injustice and compelled a Minneapolis Police Department overhaul.

At a news conference Thursday, Mayor Jacob Frey apologized to all victims of Chauvin and said that if police supervisors “had done the right thing, George Floyd would not have been murdered.”

“He should have been fired in 2017. He should have been held accountable in 2017,” Frey told reporters.

Both lawsuits named Chauvin and several other officers. The lawsuits alleged police misconduct, excessive force, and racism — Pope and Code are Black; Chauvin is white. They also said the city knew that Chauvin had a record of misconduct but didn’t stop him.

Bob Bennett, an attorney for Pope and Code, noted that other officers failed to intervene or report Chauvin, and police leaders allowed Chauvin to keep working even though they had video evidence from body cameras of his wrongdoing.

In edited body camera footage released Thursday by Bennett’s law firm, Pope is heard crying while lying on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind his back and Chauvin’s knee on his neck.

“My neck really hurts,” he says more than once. At one point, the videos show the other officers in the room walked out after Pope began crying.

“The easy thing is to blame Chauvin for everything,” Bennett said in a written statement. “The important thing that the video shows is that none of those nine to a dozen officers at the scene ever reported it, ever tried to stop it. They violated their own policy and really any sense of humanity.”

Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the department is “forced to reckon once again with the deplorable acts of someone who has proven to be a national embarrassment.” But he also cited “systemic failure” within the Minneapolis Police Department.

“I am appalled at the repetitive behavior of this coward and disgusted by the inaction and acceptance of that behavior by members of this department. Such conduct is a disgrace to the badge and an embarrassment to what is truly a very noble profession,” O’Hara said in a statement.

Code, who has a history of homelessness and mental health problems, was arrested in June 2017 after she allegedly tried to strangle her mother with an extension cord. Pope was 14 in September 2017 when, according to his lawsuit, Chauvin subjected him to excessive force while responding to a domestic assault report.

The lawsuits said body camera recordings showed Chauvin used many of the same tactics on Pope and Code that he used on Floyd. Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison on a state murder charge for killing Floyd by pressing his knee to Floyd’s neck for 9 1/2 minutes as he pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. The city also paid $27 million to Floyd’s family.

Code’s lawsuit said she was in handcuffs when Chauvin slammed her head to the ground and pinned his knee on the back of her neck for 4 minutes and 41 seconds. A second officer didn’t intervene and a responding police sergeant approved the force, the lawsuit stated.

Pope’s lawsuit said his mother was drunk when she called police because she was upset that he and his 16-year-old sister left their cellphone chargers plugged in, leading to a physical confrontation. It alleged Chauvin struck Pope in the head with a large metal flashlight at least four times. It says he then put Pope in a chokehold before pinning him to the floor and putting his knee on Pope’s neck.

“Chauvin would proceed to hold John in this prone position for more than fifteen minutes, all while John was completely subdued and not resisting,” the complaint alleged. “Over those minutes, John repeatedly cried out that he could not breathe.”

The complaint alleged that at least eight other officers did nothing to intervene. It said Chauvin did not mention in his report that he had hit Pope with his flashlight, nor did he mention pinning Pope for so long. Chauvin’s sergeant reviewed and approved his report and use of force “despite having firsthand knowledge that the report was false and misleading,” the lawsuit alleged.

Chauvin admitted to many of Pope’s allegations when he pleaded guilty in December 2021 to federal charges for violating the civil rights of both Floyd and Pope. He was sentenced in July to 21 years on those charges.

Chauvin is serving his sentences concurrently in a federal prison in Arizona.

293,"Big flames, raining embers in New Jersey Pine Barrens fire","MANCHESTER, N. J. (AP) — The 200-foot wall of flames, the burning embers landing miles away and the carloads of evacuees fleeing to shelter at a high school — it all took place in New Jersey but could happen in almost every part of the country this week due to dry conditions and strong winds that have raised the danger of forest fires.

As firefighters worked Wednesday to contain a fire that tore through 6 square miles (15 square kilometers) of New Jersey’s Pine Barrens, the National Weather Service issued so-called “red flag warnings” on Wednesday for 20 states spanning the nation. The agency cautioned that dry, windy conditions similar to those in New Jersey were increasing the danger of forest fires elsewhere, too.

The blaze in Manchester, near Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, forced the evacuation of around 170 homes late Tuesday, with police and fire officials going door-to-door to ask people to take temporary shelter at a nearby high school. Helicopters were filling large containers with water from a nearby lake Wednesday and dropping it on the flames.

No one was injured and no homes were damaged, although firefighters said 20 structures were still considered threatened Wednesday afternoon, by which time the fire had been 60% contained.

“We saw the red glow in the sky, and every time the wind would shift, it got worse,” said Jason Cylenica, who lives in the neighborhood closest to the fire. His wife, Cynthia Tiemper, said burning embers were landing in their back yard Tuesday night, making them decide to evacuate even before the fire department knocked on their door at 10:45 p.m.

“We left so fast I didn’t even bring socks,” she said. “It was like, ‘You grab the dog, I’ll grab this and let’s go.’ When we got back here this morning and saw that everything was still here, it was like prayers had been answered.”

Although the state is not in a drought, there’s no chance of rain until the weekend in the part of New Jersey where the fire is burning. The state on Wednesday banned campfires and imposed restrictions on charcoal or gas fires.

April is the peak month for forest fires in New Jersey, officials said. And despite its status as the nation’s most densely populated state, 40% of it is forest. There are about 1,500 wildfires a year in New Jersey, according to the state Forest Fire Service.

Forest fires are a common occurrence in the Pine Barrens, a 1.1 million-acre state and federally protected reserve about halfway between Philadelphia to the west and the Atlantic coast to the east. On Wednesday afternoon, the Forest Fire Service was responding to another blaze in West Milford in the northwest potion of the state near Route 23, but estimates of the size of that fire were not immediately available.

“This fire exhibited extreme fire behavior,” John Cecil, an assistant commissioner in the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, said of the Pine Barrens blaze. “I don’t mean to be dramatic, but this was a severe situation that these guys and gals managed to keep in a place and protect lives and property from that.”

About 75 firefighters, two helicopters, bulldozers and 15 fire engines were being used to battle the flames.

Greg McLaughlin, the Forest Fire Service chief, said the blaze began on the grounds of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a military facility spanning several municipalities at about 4 p.m. Tuesday. Military personnel tried to extinguish it, but winds soon spread the fire beyond the base’s perimeter and across a busy highway, Route 539, necessitating a large response from numerous municipalities in the region.

A cause of the fire wasn’t given, but authorities said they’re investigating.

In the parking lot of a firehouse miles away from the fire scene, McLaughlin held up a plastic bag filled with small pieces of charred wood — dead embers that had flown through the air over two miles away and threatened to start new fires.

Last month, a wildfire in the Pine Barrens threatened over a dozen homes in Little Egg Harbor, not far from the site of a massive forest fire in 2007 at an Air National Guard target range. That fire burned nearly 27 square miles (70 square kilometers).

Fire is an essential element of the Pine Barrens ecosystem; many of the pine trees there rely on heat from fires to release seeds from their cones, providing for the growth of new trees.

294,"Decades later, Mike Tramp re-records White Lion hits","Imagine an Olympic champion runner who blew away the competition and won numerous medals in his heyday. Now picture that same runner 40 years later, wrapped in the same flag, but taking a leisurely stroll around the track.

That’s the problem with this album, in which Mike Tramp, the former singer of White Lion, re-records some of the hair metal heroes’ greatest hits. On the one hand, this is some of the finest music of the genre, and it’s great to have these songs back in circulation.

On the other hand, Tramp is now 62, and the voice that powered hits like “Tell Me,” “Wait,” “Little Fighter” and “When The Children Cry” is just not there anymore.

To his credit, Tramp doesn’t reach for what’s not available. But singing these high-energy hits an octave lower robs them of a good deal of their energy and immediacy.

His backing band, led by guitarist Marcus Nand, does a creditable job with these songs, but Nand is no Vito Bratta, the onetime Eddie Van Halen disciple whose bombastic fretwork is such an integral part of the White Lion sound.

“Lady Of The Valley” kicks off the album with a longtime concert staple, but it’s the first of many times where Tramp’s toned-down vocals keep the track from truly igniting. “When The Children Cry,” the acoustic classic that remains a radio staple today, becomes a piano ballad here, and “Broken Heart,” which was absolutely perfect on the band’s 1985 debut album “Fight To Survive” is as watered down and neutered here as it was when the band first redid it on 1991′s “Mane Attraction.”

If White Lion fans cry when they hear this, let ’em know he at least tried.",0
295,Corporate borrowers squeezed by rising rates,"Companies that piled on debt throughout the pandemic and the economic recovery could be in for a tough road ahead as the bills come due.

Corporate borrowers will have to pay more of that debt back as refinancing grows more difficult with rising interest rates. The persistent squeeze from inflation is keeping costs high for many companies while stifling consumer demand and sapping purchasing power.

Corporate debt rose from roughly $16.3 trillion just before the pandemic hit to about $19.8 trillion near the end of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve. Economists and analysts expect some kind of recession to hit the U. S. economy in 2023 and the severity of it could weigh heavily on both large and small companies as they repay debt.

“Near-term profit pressures on U. S. corporate borrowers look set to intensify,” noted a report from S&P Global Ratings on the outlook for corporate credit.

The report shows that corporate debt coming due steadily rises through 2026, with speculative-grade debt surpassing investment-grade debt in 2027. Speculative-grade debt carries a higher risk of default than investment-grade.

“Faced with an overhang of pandemic-era debt that begins to mature in 2025, companies will be looking for refinancing opportunities,” S&P Global Ratings said.

Refinancing risks are increasing partly because of the potential for a recession. Credit rating trends are already turning negative, with more downgrades than upgrades on debt since August. It all adds up to default risks rising as companies get pinched by a weakening economy and have a difficult time refinancing existing debt.

The Federal Reserve has sharply raised its benchmark interest rate in an effort to tame inflation, but that has made borrowing more expensive. The rate is currently in a range of 4.50% to 4.75% after starting last year at basically zero. The widespread expectation is now for the Fed to increase the rate to at least 5.25% by June and some bets on Wall Street are calling for a rate of up to 5.50%.

The tougher financing atmosphere is running up against an economic slowdown. Google’s parent company Alphabet, Dell and other big technology companies have been cutting staff in an effort to control costs as demand wanes. Retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, have been issuing warnings about weaker consumer spending.

“Many companies will find it more difficult to balance still-elevated input costs and waning demand amid the prospects of a downturn in the world’s largest economy,” S&P Global Ratings said.

The broader labor market has remained relatively strong, but a downturn in employment could further weaken consumer spending and hit corporate earnings. Companies in the S&P 500 reported a broad 4.6% contraction in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2022 and analysts expect similar results during the first half of 2023.",0
296,"UN, others cite new displacement from Ethiopia's Tigray","ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — Forces from Ethiopia’s Amhara region have displaced tens of thousands of ethnic Tigrayans from disputed territory in the north of the country in recent weeks despite a peace deal agreed late last year, according to aid workers and internal agency documents seen by the AP.

The Mai Tsebri area in northwestern Tigray is close to the regional border with Amhara. It changed hands several times during the war, which erupted in 2020 and ended with a ceasefire in November. The Amhara people claim the area as their own.

Since early March, some 47,000 people uprooted from Mai Tsebri have gone to Endabaguna, a town roughly 55 kilometers (34 miles) further north, according to United Nations figures seen by the AP on Thursday.

Another report, prepared by a humanitarian agency, says residents fled Mai Tsebri because of “harassment, ethnic profiling and direct threats” from irregular Amhara forces that also carried out “evictions.”

That report adds that there have been no aid deliveries to Endabaguna since the displaced people started arriving. As a result, it says, they are “on the brink of starvation.”

The displaced people at Endabaguna are sheltering in a reception center originally built by the U. N. and Ethiopia’s government for refugees from Eritrea, which borders Tigray. The site was badly damaged during the war.

An aid worker who recently visited the center said conditions there were “very bad” and the number of people was “increasing day by day.”

“The roofing and pipelines are damaged, there is no toilet and latrine, the doors and windows of the rooms are looted (or) damaged, and there is no proper water supply,” said the aid worker, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

It was not immediately possible to get a comment from Amhara authorities.

A second aid worker, who also requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to a reporter, said many of the people recently uprooted from Mai Tsebri were displaced for a second time, having already been forced from their homes in the western part of Tigray.

Amhara forces annexed western Tigray in the early stages of the war. They stand accused of “ethnic cleansing” by the U. S. State Department after they forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans from the area.

Under the recent ceasefire, aid deliveries to Tigray resumed after two years of restrictions. However, aid workers say Amhara forces have continued to block food distribution around Mai Tsebri, and residents have reported killings.

One Mai Tsebri resident, Teferi Muley, said he fled the area in November after he was threatened by Amhara troops, who accused him of helping the Tigray rebels. He said he returned in March to the nearby village of Haida, where he witnessed the shooting of several artisanal gold miners by Amhara troops.

Last week Ethiopia’s government said it planned to fold the security forces of the 11 federal regions into the national army or police. This prompted a wave of protest across Amhara, as well as gun battles between the federal military and regional Amhara units who refused to disarm.

Humanitarian officials believe the upheaval will likely lead to an increase in displacements from Mai Tsebri, which already stand at an average of 150 households every day, according to an assessment by another aid agency.",0
297,Florida GOP passes 6-week abortion ban; DeSantis supports it,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The Republican-dominated Florida Legislature on Thursday approved a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a proposal supported by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis as he prepares for an expected presidential run.

DeSantis is expected to sign the bill into law. Florida currently prohibits abortions after 15 weeks.

A six-week ban would give DeSantis a key political victory among Republican primary voters as he prepares to launch a presidential candidacy built on his national brand as a conservative standard bearer.

The policy would also have wider implications for abortion access throughout the South in the wake of the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade and leaving decisions about abortion access to states. Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, while Georgia forbids the procedure after cardiac activity can be detected, which is around six weeks.

“We have the opportunity to lead the national debate about the importance of protecting life and giving every child the opportunity to be born and find his or her purpose,” said Republican Rep. Jenna Persons-Mulicka, who carried the bill in the House.

Democrats and abortion-rights groups have criticized Florida’s proposal as extreme.

“This ban would prevent four million Florida women of reproductive age from accessing abortion care after six weeks — before many women even know they’re pregnant,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement issued after Thursday’s vote. “This ban would also impact the nearly 15 million women of reproductive age who live in abortion-banning states throughout the South, many of whom have previously relied on travel to Florida as an option to access care.”

The bill contains some exceptions, including to save the woman’s life. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape or incest would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy, provided a woman has documentation such as a restraining order or police report. DeSantis has called the rape and incest provisions sensible.

Drugs used in medication-induced abortions — which make up the majority of those provided nationally — could be dispensed only in person or by a physician under the Florida bill. Separately, nationwide access to the abortion pill mifepristone is being challenged in court.

Florida’s six-week ban would take effect only if the state’s current 15-week ban is upheld in an ongoing legal challenge that is before the state Supreme Court, which is controlled by conservatives.

“I can’t think of any bill that’s going to provide more protections to more people who are more vulnerable than this piece of legislation,” said Republican Rep. Mike Beltran, who said the bill’s exceptions and six-week timeframe represented a compromise.

Abortion bans are popular among some religious conservatives who are part of the GOP voting base, but the issue has motivated many others to vote for Democrats. Republicans in recent weeks and months have suffered defeats in elections centered on abortion access in states such as Kentucky, Michigan and Wisconsin.

“Have we learned nothing?” House Democratic Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell said of recent elections in other states. “Do we not listen to our constituents and to the people of Florida and what they are asking for?”

DeSantis, who often places himself on the front lines of culture war issues, has said he backs the six-week ban but has appeared uncharacteristically tepid on the bill. He has often said, “We welcome pro-life legislation,” when asked about the policy.

DeSantis is expected to announce his presidential candidacy after the session ends in May, with his potential White House run in part buoyed by the conservative policies approved by the Republican supermajority in the Statehouse this year.

Democrats, without power at any level of state government, have mostly turned to stall tactics and protests to oppose the bill, which easily passed both chambers on largely party-line votes. The Senate approved it last week, and the House did so Thursday.

A Democratic senator and chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party were arrested and charged with trespassing during a protest in Tallahassee against the six-week ban. In a last ditch move to delay the bill’s passage in the House on Thursday, Democrats filed dozens of amendments to the proposal, all of which were rejected by Republicans.

“Women’s health and their personal right to choose is being stolen,” said Democratic Rep. Felicia Simone Robinson. “So I ask: Is Florida truly a free state?”",0
298,Harper working out at 1B to hasten return from surgery,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper is working out at first base in an attempt to speed his recovery from Tommy John surgery.

“I’m not sure how long it will take,” manager Rob Thomson said before Thursday’s game against Cincinnati.

Harper, usually an outfielder, approached Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski with the idea, The Athletic reported.

Thomson expects the 30-year-old to work out daily at first base, usually with infield coach Bobby Dickerson. Harper has two big league appearances at first base in 11 seasons, the last in 2021.

“He was out there today,” Thomson said. “He looked fine. Bobby’s a great coach. He’s athletic. He wants to do it.”

Harper, a two-time National League MVP, was operated on last Nov. 23 and Philadelphia projects him returning at first as a designated hitter. Harper last week began taking on-field batting practice.

First baseman Rhys Hoskins will miss the season after tearing his left ACL during a spring training game on March 23. Darick Hall. who started five of the first six games at first, had surgery Wednesday to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb and is projected to be sidelined for two months.

“His surgery went well,” Thomson said. “He’ll rehab in Philadelphia and then we’ll send him to Clearwater.”",0
299,Boygenius is cohesive and powerful in 'The Record',"The internet’s favorite indie girls welcome you into the brilliant, colorful world of Boygenius, again.

The supergroup, consisting of best friends Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, formed and released their critically well-received self-titled EP in 2018. Five years later, the powerhouse women of Boygenius masterfully recapture the same magic in their first full-length album, “The Record.”

Cohesion within the group sneaks up on you like a shadow in the night. The album is soft, brutal and a reflection of a cruel, unrelenting world full of fatalistic imagery, but the love they’ve discovered in each other and in the music they craft together saves and reignites them.

Album single “Emily I’m Sorry,” dives into Bridgers’ perspective on a past relationship, apologizing for all the wrongdoing she inflicted on Emily. Dacus and Baker seamlessly harmonize with Bridgers as she sings anxiously, “I’m 27 and I don’t know who I am (Don’t know who I am)/But I know what I want.”

“Not Strong Enough” is an uptempo, guitar-heavy, folksy song focused on self-hatred and loathing where Baker’s softness shines. She croons contemplating death: “Drag racing through the canyon/Singing ‘Boys Don’t Cry’/Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement?”

Standout “Revolution 0” wistfully tells the story of falling in love on the internet, Bridgers said in a Rolling Stone interview. Some speculate that the song is an examination of the breakup between Bridgers and actor Paul Mescal, her former fiancé. “If it isn’t love/Then what the f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) is it?/I guess just let me pretend,” she whispers sorrowfully with backing from the rest of Boygenius.

An ultimate rock jam riddled with electric guitar and drums, the witty “Satanist” forces the group to ponder philosophical questions and if they’re deal breakers. Dacus asks confidently, “Will you be a nihilist with me?/If nothing matters/That’s a relief to me.”

“Letters To An Old Poet” is an exemplary closing piano ballad with beautiful production, breathing life throughout the three minutes. Bridgers sings, “You think you’re a good person because you don’t punch me in the stomach.” Dacus and Baker join her in support when she sings she wants to be happy.

During the journey into “The Record,” Baker, Dacus and Bridgers bare truths from the deepest parts of themselves, but there’s strength in their togetherness — their truths are a little less formidable when they join as one.

300,Haven't filed taxes yet? Don't panic. Here's what to know,"NEW YORK (AP) — The deadline to file your taxes is Tuesday, which is just around the corner. Filing U. S. tax returns — especially for the first time — can seem like a daunting task, but there are steps you can take to make it less stressful.

Whether you do your taxes yourself, go to a tax clinic or hire a professional, navigating the tax system can be complicated and stressful. Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate for Credit Karma, recommends you go easy on yourself.

“Take a breath. Take some time, set out an hour, or go through it over the weekend. You’ll hopefully see that it’s a lot simpler than you think,” Alev said.

If you find the process too confusing, there are plenty of free resources to help you get through it.

If you are worried that you might not have enough time to file your taxes before the deadline, you can file for an extension, though it’s not ideal (more on that below.)

Here’s what you need to know:

Taxpayers have until Tuesday to submit their returns from 2022.

While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs:

— W-2 forms, if you are employed

— 1099-G, if you are unemployed

— 1099 forms, if you are self-employed

— Any eligible deduction, such as educational expenses, medical bills, charitable donations, etc.

— Tax credits, such as child tax credit, retirement savings contributions credit, etc.

To find a more detailed document list, visit the IRS website.

Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals, recommends gathering all of your documents in one place before you start your tax return and also having your documents from last year if your financial situation has drastically changed.

Theresa Grover, site coordinator for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, also recommends taxpayers create an identity protection PIN number with the IRS to guard against identity theft. Once you create a number, the IRS will require it to file your tax return.

You can either file your taxes online or on paper. However, there is a big time difference between the two options. Paper filing can take up to six months for the IRS to process, while electronic filing cuts it down to three weeks.

For those who make $73,000 or less per year, the IRS offers free guided tax preparation that does the math for you. If you have questions while working on your tax forms, the IRS also offers an interactive tax assistant tool that can provide answers based on your information.

Beyond the popular companies such as TurboTax and H&R Block, taxpayers can also hire licensed professionals, such as certified public accountants. The IRS offers a directory of tax preparers across the United States.

The IRS also funds two types of programs that offer free tax help: VITA and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE). People who earn $60,000 or less a year, have disabilities or are limited English speakers, qualify for the VITA program. Those who are 60 or older, qualify for the TCE program. The IRS has a site for locating organizations hosting VITA and TCE clinics.

If you have a tax problem, there are clinics around the country that can help you resolve these issues. Generally, these tax clinics also offer services in other languages such as Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese.

Many people fear getting in trouble with the IRS if they make a mistake. Here’s how to avoid some of the most common ones:

— Double check your name on your Social Security card.

When working with clients, O’Saben always asks them to bring their Social Security card to double-check their number and their legal name, which can change when when people get married.

“You may have changed your name but you didn’t change it with Social Security,” O’Saben said. “If the Social Security number doesn’t match to the first four letters of the last name, the return will be rejected and that will delay processing.”

— Search for tax statements if you have opted out of paper mail.

Many people like to opt out of snail mail, but paper mail can also include your tax documents.

“If you didn’t get anything in the mail doesn’t mean that there isn’t an information document out there that you need to be aware of and report accordingly,” O’Saben said.

— Make sure you report all of your income.

If you had more than one job in 2022, you need the W-2 forms for each — not just the one from the job you ended the year with, says Christina Wease, interim director of the tax clinic at Michigan State University.

Additionally, if you have a business that uses PayPal or Venmo as a service, it must be reported in your tax return. For 2022, the use of those services needs to be reported if they amounted to 200 transactions in the calendar year and more than $20,000 in sales from goods or services.

Mistakes happen, and the IRS takes different approaches depending on each case. In general, if you make a mistake or you’re missing something in your tax records, the IRS will audit you, Alev said. An audit means that the IRS will ask you for more documentation.

“Generally, they are very understanding and willing to work with folks. You’re not going to get arrested if you type in the wrong field,” Alev said.

If you run out of time to file your tax return, you can file for an extension. However, it is important to remember that the extension is only to file your taxes, not to pay them. If you owe taxes, you should pay an estimated amount before the deadline so you avoid paying penalties and interest. If you expect to receive a refund, you will still receive your money when you file your taxes.

The deadline to file for an extension is Tuesday, which will give you until Oct. 16 to file your taxes. You can file for an extension through your tax software or preparer of preference, the IRS Free File tool or via mail.

If you missed the tax deadline and you didn’t file for an extension, there are several penalties that you might receive. If you missed the deadline you might receive a failure-to-file penalty. This penalty will be 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month the tax return is late, according to the IRS.

If you owe taxes and you didn’t pay them prior to the tax deadline, you will receive a failure-to-pay penalty. Interest will also be charged on both taxes and penalties owed. If you are due for a refund, you will not receive a penalty and you will receive your tax return payment. If you had special circumstances that meant you were unable to file or pay your taxes on time, you might be able to remove or reduce your penalty.

If the amount of taxes you owe becomes too large, you can apply for a payment plan. Payment plans will allow you to pay off over time.

Wease explains that you can file taxes late and, if you were supposed to get a refund, you might still get it. If you haven’t filed for years and you owe money to the IRS, you may be hit with penalties but the agency will can work with you to manage payment plans.

Tax season is prime time for tax scams, according to the IRS. These scams can come via phone, text, email and social media. The IRS uses none of those means to contact taxpayers.

Sometimes scams are even operated by tax preparers so it’s important to ask lots of questions. If a tax preparer says you will get a refund that is larger than what you’ve received in previous years, for example, that may be a red flag, O’Saben said.

If you can’t see what your tax preparer is working on, get a copy of the tax return and ask questions about each of the entries.

It’s always good practice to keep a record of your tax returns, just in case the IRS audits you for an item you reported years ago. Both Wease and O’Saben recommend keeping copies of your tax return documents for up to seven years.

301,Ohio train derailment highlights waste disposal predicament,"When word surfaced that soils and liquids laced with chemicals from the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment were being sent to southeastern Michigan for storage, local residents and politicians were livid.

“People were seeing pictures of what happened in Ohio — the smoke plumes, wildlife dying,” said Jordyn Sellek, director of a local government coalition. “They were hearing about people having health issues, and that’s scary. And now it’s coming into your community.”

So loud was the outcry that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency halted shipments from the crash site in the town of 5,000 to a hazardous waste landfill and underground deep-injection wells in suburban Detroit.

Resistance was fierce elsewhere, too, from a raucous town hall meeting in Roachdale, Indiana, to Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt barring the waste from a landfill there. EPA finally issued a pointed reminder that states cannot interfere with federally authorized waste transport.

“We ordered Norfolk Southern to clean up the mess it made, and no one should be impeding, preventing or getting in the way,” Administrator Michael Regan said March 17, adding it would take about three months to finish the job.

Yet roadblocks keep popping up. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott scuttled a company’s plan to treat East Palestine liquids and dispose of them in the city wastewater system.

The controversy illuminates an uncomfortable truth: Hazardous wastes are seemingly everywhere, from sprawling factories to household garages. They’re byproducts of industrial processes and goods consumers value. And when people want to get rid of waste, it has to go somewhere.

The U. S. has 667 facilities that treat, store and dispose of hazardous wastes and are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, according to EPA. Of those, 252 are commercial facilities that receive waste from offsite customers. The others, including factories, handle only waste generated on the premises.

Seventeen of the commercial facilities have landfills, three have deep injection wells and 12 have incinerators. Others store waste in containers while awaiting treatment or disposal.

Thirty-eight Norfolk Southern train cars derailed in the fiery Feb. 3 wreck. No one was injured but about half of East Palestine’s population was evacuated for days when authorities ignited vinyl chloride in five cars to prevent explosion. Many residents have complained of headaches, rashes and other health problems, although government officials say air and water testing hasn’t found dangerous pollution.

Long-term exposure to vinyl chloride, a colorless gas used to make products including plastic pipes, wire coatings and kitchenware, is associated with liver damage and cancer, EPA says.

Ohio officials are pressing the rail company and EPA to get rid of tainted dirt and water. Gov. Mike DeWine said March 10 that 24,400 tons of excavated soil were piled at the scene. Portions had been hauled to three facilities in Ohio and others in Michigan, Indiana and Texas before protests stalled removal.

A week later, EPA notified state environmental agencies that preventing the waste shipments could violate federal law and the U. S. Constitution’s interstate commerce provision.

Since then, neither EPA nor the company have disclosed where the East Palestine waste is going, although daily reports provide updates on volumes removed. As of Monday, 19,900 tons of soil and 11.4 million gallons (43.1 million liters) of liquid wastewater had been shipped, according to DeWine’s office. That’s enough liquid to fill more than 17 Olympic swimming pools.

A truck hauling 20 tons of the soil ran off a state road Monday and overturned, spilling about half, although the waste was contained and posed no threat to nearby waters, the Highway Patrol said.

Republic Industrial and Energy Solutions in Romulus, Michigan, received February shipments of liquid wastes for disposal in its two injection wells. Some contaminated soils went to U. S. Ecology Wayne Disposal, a landfill in Belleville, Michigan, owned by the same company.

The Romulus facility, which also stores wastes in aboveground tanks, has past regulatory violations.

The state environment department cited the facility within the past year for leaks from a sludge dewatering press, mislabeled containers and an alarm malfunction. All problems were corrected promptly and none resulted in hazardous releases to the environment, spokesman Hugh McDiarmid Jr. said.

Both facilities have permits to take hazardous materials. Vinyl chloride is among chemicals authorized for storage at Romulus, the state says.

Even so, local leaders complained they got no advance notice. “It sounds ... like we’ve been sandbagged,” said Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.

“I just don’t think Michigan, with one of the world’s biggest supplies of fresh water, is the best place to inject this stuff in the ground,” said Kevin Krause, fire services and emergency management director in Romulus.

Roman Blahoski, spokesman for the owner Republic Services, said the liquids injected into the wells were “99% water” and soils sent to the landfill had low contaminant levels. “Responsible disposal of hazardous waste is a basic community need,” he said.

Some hazardous wastes regularly accepted by disposal facilities pose greater health risks than vinyl chloride, said Bill Muno, a retired EPA official who previously headed the Midwest regional Superfund program. One example: PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls — toxic compounds widely used in electrical equipment, plastics and other products until banned in 1979.

Michigan, with 15 facilities licensed to handle hazardous wastes, doesn’t routinely get a heads-up about shipments from out of state, McDiarmid said. But in view of publicity surrounding the derailment, “we probably should have been made aware,” he said.

In a letter to state agencies, EPA said waste from the crash site “has been subject to more testing and analysis ... than many other, similar wastes regularly accepted at facilities nationwide.”

“There is nothing special or out of the ordinary about this waste, other than the fact that it’s coming from a town that has suffered deeply in the wake of a horrible trauma,” Regan said.

Under federal law, hazardous waste landfills must have double liners, leak detectors and groundwater monitoring devices, Muno said.

Contaminated soils typically are dumped from trucks into trenches or pits, compacted and capped with clay and plastic layers, then several feet of earth where grass is planted to prevent rainwater from seeping inside, he said.

Operators of injection wells — often depleted oil or gas wells extending thousands of feet underground — receive federal permits only after satisfying regulators there’s no chance the waste would contaminate drinking water aquifers, Muno said.

“They’re very well operated and maintained,” he said. “Much different from the early landfills, where people would just dig a hole in the ground and fill it up and precipitation would wash the contaminants out.”

But it’s not unreasonable for communities to be concerned about waste from disasters like the East Palestine crash, said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project.

Regulators could help by quickly describing how facilities will store, treat and dispose of the waste and posting data from air and groundwater monitoring online, said the former EPA official.

“One of the most important things government does is communicate risk as best they can,” Schaeffer said. “If you say, ‘There’s nothing to see here,’ explain why.”

While EPA and Norfolk Southern have acted legally in shipping East Palestine waste to other states, the episode should prompt discussion about its fairness — especially when the facilities are in marginalized communities, said Nick Leonard, executive director of the Detroit-based Great Lakes Environmental Law Center.

In Michigan, two-thirds of residents within three miles (4.8 kilometers) of commercial hazardous waste facilities are people of color although they make up 25% of the state’s population, he said.

“What most residents are worried about is that one catastrophic event,” Leonard said. “It basically takes one mistake and you have really serious consequences.”

The issue also raises questions about “how we might minimize the toxic materials that go into things we use in everyday life,” said McDiarmid of the Michigan environment agency. “Creating less hazardous waste is a better answer than how we dispose of it.”

302,Can France's constitutional body halt disputed pension bill?,"PARIS (AP) — French unions are staging new nationwide protests Thursday, on the eve of an expected ruling by a top constitutional body that they hope will derail President Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular pension reform plan.

If the Constitutional Council greenlights the reform, the bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 can enter into force. Yet the body has the power to reject the text, fully or partially. Here’s a look at what’s at stake ahead of Friday’s decision.

The body’s role is to make sure a law is in line with France’s Constitution prior to enactment.

In this case, it comes after Macron’s centrist government forced the pension bill through parliament without a vote, using a special constitutional power.

The council is currently composed of three women and six men aged between 64 and 77, and is headed by former Socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius. Most members are centrists and conservatives, including two named by Macron. The council’s discussions and votes are not made public.

Anne Levade, professor of public law at Paris university, said the ruling will be on strictly legal grounds. “The Constitutional Council won’t say if the pension reform is right or wrong, if it is politically in favor or against it,” she said. “The argument that will be made will be a legal reasoning.”

Opponents challenged the government’s choice to include the pension plan in a budget bill, which significantly accelerated the legislative process, arguing it should have been a regular bill instead. They hope it will provide grounds for the Constitutional Council to reject the text as a whole.

Most likely, the council will approve the biggest part of the bill while rejecting some of its articles — the body often rejects measures which have an insufficient link with the main purpose of the text, in this case social security financing.

The age measure in that perspective appears in line with a budget bill, experts said.

Rejecting a bill as a whole is “a very rare option,” Levade said, noting that only five such decisions have been made since 1959.

Political scientist Benjamin Morel said such a scenario would mean that “the bill disappears ... because the procedure that has been used (to pass it) would be considered as wrong.”

“We don’t really know whether a pension reform can go through a social security budget bill,” Morel added. “It doesn’t seem the natural way (of doing it). But there’s nothing ruling it out in the Constitution.”

Legislators opposing the pension reforms have also filed a request to start a lengthy process that could ultimately lead to a referendum on a proposal for the legal retirement age not to exceed 62.

The Constitutional Council on Friday is also expected to rule on whether that proposal meets the conditions provided by law. If so, opponents to Macron’s pension plan will have a nine-month period to register at least 4.8 million signatures — or 10% of voters.

Still, it doesn’t mean the proposal would automatically be put to referendum, Levade stressed. Macron’s government would instead be able to send it for debate at parliament. A nationwide vote would be organized only if it’s not examined by legislators.

In any case, Friday’s ruling on the referendum issue would not suspend the pension bill.

If the Constitutional Council gives its green light, Macron will be able to enact the bill within 15 days — except for any measures that are rejected.

Macron said last month he wants pension reform to be implemented by the end of the year. Some political observers suggest he could try to appease critics with a government reshuffle in the coming weeks or months.

Meanwhile, unions have vowed to continue their strikes and protests until the withdrawal of the pension plan.

They have in mind the big protests of 2006 against the creation of special contracts to more easily hire and fire people under 26. That law was withdrawn just after being enacted, under pressure of strong public opposition.

On the other hand, previous pension reforms that prompted massive protests in 2010 were still implemented.",0
303,Trump answers questions for 7 hours in NY fraud lawsuit,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump answered questions for nearly seven hours Thursday during his second deposition in a legal battle with New York’s attorney general over his company’s business practices, reversing an earlier decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and remain silent.

The Republican met all day with lawyers for Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump last year. Her lawsuit claims Trump and his family misled banks and business associates by giving them false information about his net worth and the value of assets such as hotels and golf courses.

Shortly after Trump entered the Manhattan skyscraper that houses James’ offices, his attorney, Alina Habba, said he was “not only willing but also eager to testify.”

After the deposition was finished, a lawyer for Trump’s businesses, Christopher Kise, said the former president had spent nearly seven hours “describing in detail his extraordinary business success.”

“The transactions at the center of this case were wildly profitable for the banks and for the Trump entities,” Kise said. “When the facts of this success, and not politically engineered soundbites, are out in the open, everyone will scoff at the notion any fraud took place.”

The lawsuit is unrelated to the felony criminal charges filed against Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, which led last week to his historic arraignment, the first for a former president.

James declined to answer a question about the deposition at a news conference on an unrelated matter Wednesday.

Trump previously met with James’ lawyers Aug. 10, but refused to answer all but a few procedural questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights more than 400 times. At the time, James had not yet brought her lawsuit and it was unclear whether questions about the way Trump valued his company would become the basis of a criminal case.

“Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,” he said in that deposition, which was recorded on video and later released publicly. Trump predicted a “renegade” prosecutor would try to make a criminal case out of his answers, if he gave them.

“One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly, by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day, when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom seen in this country, because I’ve experienced it,” he said.

Circumstances since then have changed. The criminal charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney focused on how the company accounted internally for payments to a lawyer, Michael Cohen, for his work paying off people not to go public with stories about extramarital sexual encounters Trump said never happened.

James’ lawsuit focused on allegations that Trump lied repeatedly about his own wealth and exaggerated the value of his assets on financial statements.

In a social media post Thursday morning, Trump called the suit “ridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me.”

He raised a fist as he left his apartment at Trump Tower in the morning, arriving by motorcade at the attorney general’s office around 9:40. The two sides took a break for lunch. Trump departed in the motorcade just before 6:15 p.m. and did not stop to speak to reporters.

The lawsuit James brought is scheduled to go to trial in October. Video recordings of Trump’s depositions could potentially be played at the trial, if the lawsuit is not settled.",0
304,GOP's Tim Scott says he backs 20-week federal abortion ban,"MANCHESTER, N. H. (AP) — Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Thursday that he supports a federal abortion ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy and would sign such legislation into law if he became president.

“It makes total sense to me,” Scott told reporters in New Hampshire, where he was meeting with GOP officials and pastors a day after announcing his exploratory committee for a 2024 presidential campaign.

Abortion has become an increasingly animating issue in elections in the wake of the U. S. Supreme Court decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide. Republican candidates are under pressure from influential anti-abortion groups to support a national ban. Democrats, including President Joe Biden, have sought to codify the right to an abortion.

Scott declined to say whether he believes medication abortion should remain legal following a Wednesday ruling by a federal appeals court that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone for now but reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used and said it could not be dispensed by mail. The Justice Department said it would ask the Supreme Court for an emergency order to put any action on hold.

“The courts are on their way to solving the problem,” Scott said of medication abortion.

As a senator, he has co-sponsored anti-abortion legislation and supported a 20-week ban with criminal penalties for abortion providers. Asked Thursday if he would sign such a bill as president, he said he supports a 20-week ban but did not comment on specific penalties.

“We should certainly always side with a culture that preserves and appreciates and respects life,” he said. “How do we do that? I certainly think that the 20-week threshold is not a question in my mind at all.”

Scott argued that questions about specific legislation obscure what he characterized as Democrats’ “radical positions” on abortion.

“When you look at the issue of abortion, one of the challenges that we have is we continue to go to the most restrictive conversations without broadening the scope,” he said.

Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, was in Iowa on Wednesday for meetings with evangelical pastors and parents who home-school their children. Both groups are part of the influential Christian conservative base of Republicans’ leadoff caucus state.

He also planned to meet with pastors in New Hampshire, generally considered one of the least religious states. Still, Scott said he expects his message to resonate.

“What we all should agree on is that we should have faith beyond ourselves. Faith in each other is beyond ourselves. Faith in the future of America is beyond ourselves,” he said.

The Republicans already in the 2024 race are former President Donald Trump, former U. N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Others, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence, are considering launching campaigns in the coming months.

DeSantis is expected to address roughly 500 Republicans at a New Hampshire GOP fundraising dinner Friday night. Scott had breakfast Thursday with state and local party officials and mingled with customers at a popular Manchester diner.

Brendan Celluci, finishing an omelet with several teammates from the minor league Portland Sea Dogs baseball team from Maine, said he didn’t expect to be meeting a presidential hopeful or being surrounded by media.

“Well, it’s not the most fun, but you know, life always throws curveballs at you,” he said.",0

After the deposition was finished, a lawyer for Trump’s businesses, Christopher Kise, said the former president had spent nearly seven hours “describing in detail his extraordinary business success.”

“The transactions at the center of this case were wildly profitable for the banks and for the Trump entities,” Kise said. “When the facts of this success, and not politically engineered soundbites, are out in the open, everyone will scoff at the notion any fraud took place.”

The lawsuit is unrelated to the felony criminal charges filed against Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, which led last week to his historic arraignment, the first for a former president.

James declined to answer a question about the deposition at a news conference on an unrelated matter Wednesday.

Trump previously met with James’ lawyers Aug. 10, but refused to answer all but a few procedural questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights more than 400 times. At the time, James had not yet brought her lawsuit and it was unclear whether questions about the way Trump valued his company would become the basis of a criminal case.

“Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,” he said in that deposition, which was recorded on video and later released publicly. Trump predicted a “renegade” prosecutor would try to make a criminal case out of his answers, if he gave them.

“One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly, by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day, when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom seen in this country, because I’ve experienced it,” he said.

Circumstances since then have changed. The criminal charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney focused on how the company accounted internally for payments to a lawyer, Michael Cohen, for his work paying off people not to go public with stories about extramarital sexual encounters Trump said never happened.

James’ lawsuit focused on allegations that Trump lied repeatedly about his own wealth and exaggerated the value of his assets on financial statements.

In a social media post Thursday morning, Trump called the suit “ridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me.”

He raised a fist as he left his apartment at Trump Tower in the morning, arriving by motorcade at the attorney general’s office around 9:40. The two sides took a break for lunch. Trump departed in the motorcade just before 6:15 p.m. and did not stop to speak to reporters.

The lawsuit James brought is scheduled to go to trial in October. Video recordings of Trump’s depositions could potentially be played at the trial, if the lawsuit is not settled.",0
306,Chip component plant to get $300M expansion in Pennsylvania,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The electronics subsidiary of German multinational health care company Merck KGaA said Wednesday it will spend $300 million to expand its specialty gas production facility in eastern Pennsylvania in a step that state officials hope will help boost the area’s appeal to the fast-growing semiconductor industry.

The subsidiary, EMD Electronics, said the expansion will create the world’s largest integrated specialty gases facility as part of its program to invest over $3.5 billion on projects by 2025, including at sites in Arizona, Texas and California.

Company officials say the site houses a research center and synthesizes materials that form core building blocks of transistors, a component of microchips.

Gov. Josh Shapiro, who attended the announcement at the site in Schuylkill County, pledged more than $1 million in state grants for the expansion.

“This industry is huge and its growth potential is enormous, and it is key to our economy and to our national security,” Shapiro told a news conference.

Chip manufacturers are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to build new factories and expand production in the United States, fueled partly by federal subsidies designed to revive domestic production of computer chips.

The subsidies are a key element of the Biden administration’s effort to sharpen the U. S. edge in military technology and manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions to Asia during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when a shortage of chips shut down factory assembly lines.",0
307,"Mary Quant, mastermind of Swinging '60s style, dies at 93","LONDON (AP) — Mary Quant, the visionary fashion designer whose colorful, sexy miniskirts epitomized London in the 1960s and influenced youth culture around the world, has died. She was 93.

Quant’s family said she died “peacefully at home” in Surrey, southern England, on Thursday.

Quant helped popularize the miniskirt — some credit her with inventing it — and the innovative tights and accessories that were an integral part of the look. She also created dresses and other simple mix-and-match garments that had an element of whimsy.

Some compared her impact on the fashion world with The Beatles’ impact on pop music.

“I think it was a happy confluence of events, which is really what fashion is so often all about,” said Hamish Bowles, international editor at large for American Vogue magazine. “She was the right person with the right sensibility in the right place at the right time. She appeared on the scene at the exact cusp of the ’60s.”

Quant was also an astute businesswoman and one of the first to understand how branding herself as a creative force could help her sustain her business and branch out into new fields, like cosmetics, he said.

Alexandra Shulman, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, wrote on Twitter: “RIP Dame Mary Quant. A leader of fashion but also in female entrepreneurship - a visionary who was much more than a great haircut.”

Quant was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the “youthquake” of the 1960s. She sensed that the days of exclusive salons were numbered, and thought that even the great Parisian designers would follow ready-to-wear trends.

The look she created was sexy and fun, a sharp break with the predictable floral day dresses commonly worn in the conservative, austere years after World War II.

Quant introduced miniskirts with hemlines up to 8 inches above the knee to the London scene in 1966 and they were an instant hit with young people, in part because they shocked and offended their elders.

While some insist she first developed the style, many also credit French designer Andre Courreges, whose 1964 spring collection included minidresses that were popular in Paris but did not have widespread impact outside France. Others cite the short skirts worn by actress Anne Francis in the 1956 film “Forbidden Planet” as the first example of the miniskirt.

Whether or not she was the first to design them, it was Quant who figured out how to market miniskirts to the masses.

Quant, who named the skirt after her favorite make of car, the Mini, recalled how it offered a “feeling of freedom and liberation.” From her shop on King’s Road in London’s trendy Chelsea neighborhood, she was part of a clothing revolution.

“It was the girls on King’s Road who invented the mini. I was making clothes which would let you run and dance and we would make them the length the customer wanted,″ she said. “I wore them very short and the customers would say, ‘shorter, shorter’.”

While Courreges came from an haute couture tradition and his expensive clothes were aimed at a limited audience, Quant used a variety of materials and colors to make miniskirts popular with young women on a limited budget.

“She blasted through barriers of snobbery and tradition, with her vision of fashion as a way of resisting stereotypes, with well-made clothes and cosmetics that were empowering and liberating, as well as affordable,” said Jenny Lister, who curated a 2020 exhibition devoted to Quant at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum.

“Fashion today owes so much to the revolutionary, trailblazing Mary Quant.”

She shot to the top of the fashion scene at the time when The Beatles and Rolling Stones dominated the music world, and she was forever linked to the heady freedoms of the 1960s.

The clothes became wildly popular and were worn by models such as Twiggy and Pattie Boyd, who was then married to Beatles guitarist George Harrison.

Asked by the Guardian newspaper in 1967 if her clothes could be considered “vulgar” because they were so revealing, Quant replied that she loved vulgarity and embraced it.

“Good taste is death, vulgarity is life,” she said, adding that the provocative poses of her models reflected the new sexual openness of the times, which was fueled by the development of the birth control pill.

Born Feb. 11, 1930, the daughter of schoolteachers, Quant studied art education at Goldsmith’s College in London before moving into fashion, working first as an apprentice to a hat-maker before trying her own designs.

With the help of her wealthy husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene, and the accountant Archie McNair, she opened Bazaar in Chelsea in 1955, at first relying on innovative window displays to bring in younger customers.

“Snobbery has gone out of fashion, and in our shops you will find duchesses jostling with typists to buy the same dress,” Quant once said. She called the store “a sophisticated candy store for grown-ups.”

Bazaar became a focal point for the young and the beautiful and those who wanted to rub shoulders with them. Small restaurants, bistros, pubs and boutiques opened nearby, giving the neighborhood the feel of a perpetual party.

The shop was such a success that she soon moved into other parts of London and began exporting her clothes to the United States, where the “British invasion” was in full swing.

Quant was unusual in that she often modeled her own clothes, usually with her hair styled in a distinctive, angular bob by hairdresser Vidal Sassoon.

She soon diversified her interests, developing a popular makeup line and also moving into kitchenware and household accessories.

The makeup proved extremely profitable, particularly in Japan, where Quant retained a devoted following.

Quant was also credited with introducing hot pants and micro-minis to the fashion scene in the late 1960s.

She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for service to the fashion industry in 1966, wearing a miniskirt when she received the honor at Buckingham Palace. In 2014, she was made a dame — the female equivalent of a knight — for services to British fashion.

At the start of this year, she was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honor, a royal honor restricted to 65 people “of distinction” in the arts, science, medicine or government.

Quant stepped down from the day-to-day management of her firm, Mary Quant Ltd., in 2000 after it was purchased by a Japanese company, but kept working as a consultant.

The firm continued to use the daisy motif and logo that Quant pioneered in the 1960s, and it long maintained a shop in London, in addition to roughly 200 shops in Japan.

308,"Taylor, Julien, Correa HR in 9-run 1st, Twins top Yanks 11-2","NEW YORK (AP) — Michael A. Taylor, rookie Edouard Julien and Carlos Correa hit consecutive homers in a nine-run first inning, and the Minnesota Twins routed the New York Yankees 11-2 on Thursday night.

Taylor homered twice and drove in four runs from the No. 9 spot in the batting order.

Joe Ryan (3-0) struck out 10 and walked none while allowing one run and three hits over seven innings. Ryan reached double digits in strikeouts after achieving the feat once in his first 33 starts.

Jhonny Brito (2-1), coming off wins in his first two major league starts,gave up seven runs and six hits in two-thirds of an inning as his ERA climbed from 6.75. Minnesota went 3 for 3 with three doubles on his sinker.

Anthony Rizzo hit a pair of solo homers for the Yankees.

Minnesota, which had lost 13 of its previous 16 games against the Yankees, had its highest-scoring inning against New York in a top of the first that took 28 minutes.

With about 25 family and friends on hand, the 23-year-old Julien had a night to remember. The Canadian opened the first inning with his first league hit and hit solo homer off Colten Brewer with two outs for an 8-0 lead. The ball bounced off a fan’s hand in the first row and Julien got the ball back when a fan threw it back on the field.

Julien became eighth player since 1974 to have his first two major league hits in same inning, according to STATS.

Minnesota had two on with no outs after Correa reached on an infield hit when a video review overturned the initial call of a forceout at second by umpire Nate Tomlinson.

Trevor Larnach hit a sacrifice fly, Jose Miranda — a cousin of Lin-Manuel — hit an RBI double and Donovan Solano hit a two-run double for a 4-0 lead.

Christian Vázquez had a RBI double, and Taylor, Julien and Corra homered in a 10-pitch span.

Taylor’s home run chased Brito, and Brewer entered with little time to warm up.

Correa returned to the lineup after missing four games with back spasms and got his first long ball since returning to the Twins during the offseason after failing physicals with the New York Mets and San Francisco.

Minnesota also hit three consecutive homers against the Yankees’ Gerrit Cole last June 9.

Taylor had hit third two-homer game and first since June 24, 2017, for Washington.

Aaron Judge went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts, ending his career-high 45-game on-base streak end. It was the third-longest streak by a Yankee since 1942.

Paul O’Neill worked his first game in the YES Network ballpark broadcast booth since 2019. Not vaccinated for COVID-19, he broadcast from a home studio the past three seasons,

Twins: INF Kyle Farmer was placed on the 10-day IL, a day after he was hit in the face by a pitch and needed surgery to reset his bottom four teeth and suture cuts around his lower lip. … Of Max Kepler (knee) is feeling better and could return by the end of the series.

Yankees: INF DJ LeMahieu (quad) was held out for a third straight game. … RHP Carlos Rodón (forearm strain) felt good after playing catch. He had been slowed by back stiffness in recent days and will throw another bullpen Sunday or Monday. … OF Harrison Bader (left oblique strain) took batting practice on the field and fielded flyballs in the outfield. Bader could begin a minor league rehabilitation assignment next week. … 3B Josh Donaldson (right hamstring strain) took grounders and ran sprints. … RHP Luis Severino (right lat strain) threw a bullpen and could throw live practice as part of a split bullpen session Monday.",0
309,"Abortion clinics reassure worried patients, set backup plans","Since a court ruling threatened the availability of a key drug used in medication abortion, calls have been pouring in to the clinics Adrienne Mansanares oversees.

Patients from near and far are “incredibly worried about whether or not they still have a valid appointment, whether they can obtain the care that they need. It’s heartbreaking,” said Mansanares, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which has clinics in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.

For now, the clinics — and many others around the country — are trying to assure patients that nothing has immediately changed while also devising backup plans in case the ruling stands.

U. S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Texas said the approval of the drug mifepristone should be revoked, a decision handed down at the same time a federal judge in Washington ordered the government to make the drug more easily accessible. The Supreme Court is expected to eventually settle the matter.

If mifepristone becomes unavailable, many doctors say they would replace the usual two-drug regimen with a slightly less effective method using only the other drug, misoprostol.

Mansanares said her staff has been sending text messages to patients to make sure they know they can still come in for care.

Clinics are also telling people they’re still offering mifepristone — although many providers worry patients will question its safety in the wake of the ruling and news coverage about it. Currently, more than half of all U. S. abortions are medication induced, and some clinics offer no other options.

“Please understand that this judge’s decision does not mean that medication abortion is not safe,” Dr. Iffath Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said on a call with journalists this week. “It is safe. It is effective. And it should be an available option for all who seek abortion care.”

Mifepristone, approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000, blocks the hormone progesterone and is also used to treat miscarriages. Millions of women around the world have used the drug, and medical groups say complications occur at a lower rate than with routine medical procedures such as wisdom teeth removal and colonoscopies.

With its future in peril, doctors are laying the groundwork for other safe options.

Mansanares said she and her colleagues pulled together a task force of clinical experts to create a misoprostol-only protocol, “so that if we needed to, we could flip the switch” from the two-drug regimen. She said nearly three-quarters of patients in her health centers choose medication abortions over surgical procedures.

In Pennsylvania, Dr. Becca Simon, a family medicine doctor who provides abortions, said she would also offer abortion procedures and one-drug medication abortion.

The one-drug option is “safe, effective, and actually in some ways can be a little quicker than” the two-drug regimen, said Simon, a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “It may have some more side effects, but we have medications” to help patients deal with them.

Dr. Gopika Krishna, an OB-GYN in New York and another fellow in the group, said she and her colleagues are still weighing their options but are also considering the one-drug method. She pointed out that it’s the subject of recent guidance from national medical organizations, is considered safe by the World Health Organization and is used in other countries where mifepristone isn’t available.

But some doctors said the one-drug regimen is not ideal. The two-drug combination is about 95% to 99% effective in ending a pregnancy. Used alone, misoprostol is less effective. Some research rates it around 85% effective, although other studies say it’s closer to that of the two-drug combination.

Dr. Iman Alsaden, medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said staff at her clinics in Kansas are gearing up to provide misoprostol-only abortions if needed. Consent forms and patient information sheets have been prepared. Staff has been trained.

“It would not be the most medically sound thing to do. But if we have to comply with the law, we will,” Alsaden said.

She’s worried about what could happen if misoprostol fails to end a pregnancy, especially for out-of-state patients driving up to 12 hours for care.

“There’s going to be people that, you know, came to Kansas from Texas, and they don’t have the means or funds or ability to come back,” she said. “And now you’re in a situation where that person is forced to be pregnant.”

Andrea Gallegos, administrator of the Alamo Women’s Clinic in the southern Illinois city of Carbondale, has much the same concern, and is waiting to see how the lawsuits are resolved before making any decisions about what care to offer.

Wisp, a company that provides telehealth medication abortions in nine states, would definitely offer a misoprostol-only regimen if necessary. But spokeswoman Jenny Dwork said the switch would involve website updates and other changes, meaning the company wouldn’t be able to provide their services for around two weeks — “further restricting access to those who need it.”

Denise Harle, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which filed the lawsuit in Texas, said she was “very concerned” doctors were considering misoprostol-only abortions.

“To me, that would suggest, again, putting profit from abortion over the health and safety of women,” she said, adding that it was “premature to discuss” whether the single-drug protocol would prompt future litigation.

“Part of the tactic from anti-abortion groups is to create a sense where people feel like abortion is confusing, that abortion isn’t safe,” Krishna said. “That’s not true.”

Alsaden said she’s scared for the patients.

“I will continue to serve them as long as I can,” she said. “But it’s just like totally devastating.”

310,Jury selection begins in defamation lawsuit against Fox News,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Potential jurors in a defamation trial seeking to hold Fox News responsible for repeatedly airing false claims related to the 2020 presidential election were asked Thursday whether they were viewers of the network and had any opinions about allies of former President Donald Trump who helped spread the allegations after his loss.

With jury selection closed to the media and public, Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis announced by the afternoon that the interview process had produced a large enough pool from which to choose 12 jurors and 12 alternates. The seating of jurors will begin Monday morning, followed by opening statements from lawyers.

Potential jurors also were questioned whether they knew or had any opinion of lawyers Rudy Giuliani or Sidney Powell, who represented Trump after his defeat and appeared on Fox News programs. There were questions, too, concerning Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO who has helped spread conspiracy theories related to voting machines.

News habits were a key focus of the questionnaire given to potential jurors, who were asked whether they regularly watch or avoid Fox News programs and whether that would affect their ability to be fair and impartial.

Davis had made clear that the selection process would be done out of public view to ensure the privacy and safety of potential jurors.

“Because of the nature of the case and under the statute, I can take those steps to protect jurors,” the judge said, noting the case has received international attention.

“I need to make sure that the jury remains unaffected by this,” Davis added.

Jury selection in Delaware is usually done in public but occasionally is closed, such as in high-profile criminal cases or those involving alleged gang activity.

On Thursday morning, the judge met privately with potential jurors and handed out forms asking several routine questions, including whether those in the jury pool have ever worked for, or know anyone who has worked for Fox or Dominion Voting Systems, the Colorado-based voting machine company that filed the defamation lawsuit.

They also were asked whether they know any of the potential witnesses for the trial, a list of nearly 120 names.

Davis previously rejected a request by lawyers for Dominion to ask potential jurors whether they believe the 2020 presidential election may have been stolen or illegitimate or whether President Joe Biden was fraudulently elected.

Dominion also unsuccessfully sought to have jurors questioned on whether they agreed that the company committed fraud by rigging the election or that Dominion’s software and algorithms manipulated vote counts.

Davis also didn’t allow questions related to some of the claims aired on Fox in the weeks after the election, including whether jurors agreed that Dominion is owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for the late strongman Hugo Chávez or that it paid kickbacks to government officials who used its machines that year.

Dominion is suing Fox for $1.6 billion, alleging it damaged the company by repeatedly airing such allegations. Internal Fox communications produced as part of the lawsuit show that many Fox executives and on-air hosts didn’t believe the claims but broadcast them anyway.

The judge began Thursday’s proceeding by denying a request by certain media outlets for permission to record and rebroadcast a live audio feed of the trial. The outlets sought similar permission for the jury selection, even though it is being done in private without audio access.

Davis told lawyers and media representatives in the courtroom that even providing an audio feed of the trial is unprecedented.

“You’re getting the most access of any media in a Superior Court case in Delaware,” he said.

The trial is expected to last six weeks.",0
311,2 Indianapolis police officers indicted in Black man's death,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Two Indianapolis police officers have been indicted by a grand jury in the death of a Black man who died last year after being taken into police custody at his parents’ home, prosecutors said Thursday.

The indictment of officers Adam Ahmad and Steven Sanchez comes nearly a year after Herman Whitfield III’s death. His family sued the city of Indianapolis and six police officers in June over the 39-year-old pianist’s death.

Sanchez was indicted on two counts of involuntary manslaughter, while Ahmad was indicted on one count, Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said in a news release. Both were also indicted on charges of reckless homicide, battery resulting in serious bodily injury and battery resulting in moderate injury — all felony charges — and on a misdemeanor battery charge.

Online court records did not list an attorney for either Ahmad or Sanchez.

Five officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and a recruit trainee were called to the home of Whitfield’s parents on April 25, 2022, while he was in the throes of a mental health episode, The Indianapolis Star reported. During that interaction, police used a stun gun on Whitfield and handcuffed him naked and facedown on the ground, according to the newspaper.

He died shortly after arriving at a hospital. An autopsy determined that he died from heart failure while under law enforcement restraint and ruled the death a homicide, the newspaper reported.

The lawsuit filed by Whitfield’s family claims responding officers used a stun gun on him and then “crushed the breath out of an unarmed, non-violent” man. It also alleges that the officers ignored Whitfield’s cries of “I can’t breathe.”

Whitfield, whom officers described as about 6-foot-2 (1.9 meters) and around 280 pounds (127 kilograms), was experiencing a mental health issue and needed an ambulance, responding officers have said.

The officers told investigators that they tried negotiating with Whitfield and using de-escalation tactics for more than 10 minutes before Whitfield moved quickly toward an officer, police said.

“The officer activated the Taser twice and the man continued to resist,” police said in a news release at the time.

Officers handcuffed Whitfield, but medics received no response from him, and they began CPR, police said.",0
312,Biden administration seeks input on AI safety measures,"President Joe Biden’s administration wants stronger measures to test the safety of artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT before they are publicly released, though it hasn’t decided if the government will have a role in doing the vetting.

The U. S. Commerce Department on Tuesday said it will spend the next 60 days fielding opinions on the possibility of AI audits, risk assessments and other measures that could ease consumer concerns about these new systems.

“There is a heightened level of concern now, given the pace of innovation, that it needs to happen responsibly,” said Assistant Commerce Secretary Alan Davidson, administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.

The NTIA, more of an adviser than a regulator, is seeking feedback about what policies could make commercial AI tools more accountable.

Biden last week said during a meeting with his council of science and technology advisers that tech companies must ensure their products are safe before releasing them to the public.

The Biden administration also last year unveiled a set of far-reaching goals aimed at averting harms caused by the rise of AI systems, but that was before the release of ChatGPT, from San Francisco startup OpenAI, and similar products from Microsoft and Google led to wider awareness of the capabilities of the latest AI tools that can generate human-like passages of text, as well as new images and video.

“These new language models, for example, are really powerful and they do have the potential to generate real harm,” Davidson said in an interview. “We think that these accountability mechanisms could truly help by providing greater trust in the innovation that’s happening.”

The NTIA’s notice leans heavily on requesting comment about “self-regulatory” measures that the companies that build the technology would be likely to lead. That’s a contrast to the European Union, where lawmakers this month are negotiating the passage of new laws that could set strict limits on AI tools depending on how high a risk they pose.",0
313,Asian shares mostly fall amid worries about slowing economy,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares were trading mostly lower Thursday as investors turned their attention to upcoming earnings reports and other economic indicators.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 1.1% in morning trading to 27,507.65. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.3% to 7,214.90. South Korea’s Kospi fell nearly 0.8% to 2,476.08. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was virtually unchanged, inching up less than 0.1% to 20,277.01. The Shanghai Composite slipped less than 0.1% to 3,312.22.

While efforts to cool inflation by raising interest rates are designed to slow overheated economies, the worry is that central bank policymakers might overdo it, leading to recession.

Many regional economies are seeing weakness in exports due to softer demand in major markets like the United States. That has dulled the impact of a rebound in China as its economy recovers from pandemic-related disruptions.

Stocks on Wall Street mostly slipped Wednesday following the latest signals that the U. S. economy is slowing under the weight of much higher interest rates.

“Wall Street is realizing that you need a strong economy to keep stocks heading higher,” Edward Moya of Oanda said in a commentary. “The US economy is clearly in slowdown mode and expectations should be for further labor market weakness.”

The S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 4,090.38 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% to 33,482.72. But the Nasdaq composite dropped 1.1% to 11,996.86.

One report from the Institute for Supply Management said that growth in the U. S. services sector slowed last month by more than economists expected, as the pace of new orders cooled. A separate report suggested private employers added 145,000 jobs in March, down sharply from February’s 261,000. Perhaps more importantly for markets, pay raises also weakened for workers, according to the ADP Research Institute.

“Our March payroll data is one of several signals that the economy is slowing,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. “Employers are pulling back from a year of strong hiring and pay growth, after a three-month plateau, is inching down.”

ADP’s private payroll report could offer a preview of what Friday’s more comprehensive jobs report from the U. S. government will show. Economists expect it to say employers added 240,000 jobs last month, down from 311,000 in February.

If the job market really is slowing from the strong growth that’s helped to prop up the larger economy recently, it could offer the Fed reason to pause on its hikes to interest rates.

That’s a big deal for markets not only because it could lessen the odds of an upcoming recession, which some economists already see as a high probability. Higher rates also drag on prices for stocks, bonds and other investments.

Other reports on the economy this week also came in weaker than expected, including readings on the number of job openings across the country and the health of the manufacturing sector.

The reports have traders increasing bets for the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting in May, which would be the first time that’s happened in more than a year. Many traders are also betting the Fed will have to cut rates later this year, something that can act like steroids for markets.

The Fed, though, has consistently said it doesn’t expect to cut rates this year.

On the winning side Wednesday was Johnson & Johnson, which rose 4.5% after it proposed to pay nearly $9 billion to cover allegations that its baby powder containing talc caused cancer. It was one of the biggest drivers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s gain for Wednesday.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 3.30% from 3.34% late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans. The two-year yield, which tends to move more on expectations for the Fed, slipped to 3.80% from 3.82%.

Gold held relatively steady and dipped $2.60 to settle at $2,035.60 per ounce. It’s up more than 11% amid worries about the strength of the global banking system.

In other trading, benchmark U. S. crude fell 69 cents to $79.92 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 10 cents to $80.61 on Wednesday. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 72 cents to $84.27 a barrel.

The U. S. dollar inched down to 131.16 Japanese yen from 131.30 yen. The euro cost $1.0888, down from $1.0908. ___",0
314,"Slovakia's central bank chief fined for bribery, faces trial","BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — The head of Slovakia’s central bank, who is a member of the European Central Bank committee that decides monetary policy for 20 countries, was convicted Thursday of bribery and fined 100,000 euros ($110,000).

The country’s Special Criminal Court handed National Bank of Slovakia Gov. Peter Kazimir a two-year suspended sentence, said Katarina Kudjakova, a spokesperson for the court. Not paying the fine would mean jail time.

The verdict was issued without a trial, however, and the state prosecution service appealed it shortly afterward, sending the case back to court. Kazimir also could appeal.

Kazimir is accused of handing a bribe of 48,000 euros ($53,000) to the head of the country’s tax office related to a tax investigation of private companies, but few details were available because there was no trial.

Kazimir didn’t immediately comment, but he previously denied any wrongdoing.

President Zuzana Caputova said Kazimir should consider resigning, and Prime Minister Eduard Heger called it “unacceptable” for him to head the central bank.

Slovakia is one of 20 countries that use the euro currency, and Kazimir is a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, its main decision-making body. The ECB said it had no comment.

The case dates to when Kazimir served as finance minister from 2012 to 2019 in the leftist government of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico and was a member of Fico’s Smer-Social Democracy party before taking over his central bank job.

Smer lost the 2020 general election and was replaced by a coalition government whose parties campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket.

The new government made fighting corruption a key policy issue. Since it took power, a number of senior officials, police officers, judges, prosecutors, politicians and businesspeople have been charged with corruption and other crimes.

315,Louisville attack shows challenge of curbing violent videos,"NEW YORK (AP) — Social media companies are once again in the spotlight after a bank employee in Louisville, Kentucky, killed five people in a mass shooting and livestreamed the attack on Instagram.

Tech companies have gotten better in recent years at cooperating to tamp down the spread of mass shooting videos on mainstream platforms. But there’s still no easy way to stop shooters from broadcasting their grisly crimes without shutting down livestreaming services altogether.

Here’s what we know so far about what happened in Louisville:

Instagram parent company Meta, which also owns Facebook, said in a statement that it quickly removed the livestream of the Louisville shooting on Monday morning.

But Meta did not immediately respond to questions Tuesday about how long it took to take down the livestream — or how many people watched it before it was removed.

Instagram allows users to anonymously report livestreams. Once a report has been submitted, the company’s policy states that it will review the broadcast “as quickly as possible” and remove those that violate its policies. Depending on the severity of the situation, the company may decide to end a live broadcast, disable the account or contact law enforcement.

IS THIS THE FIRST LIVESTREAMED SHOOTING?

No. All told, there have been seven perpetrator-produced videos of violence posted on social media in the past four years that major companies have tried to keep off their platforms, according to the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.

In September, a gunman livestreamed his attack on people in Memphis, Tennessee, during a rampage that killed four and wounded three, police said. The shooting came four months after a white gunman massacred 10 Black shoppers and workers — and wounded three — in a shooting at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that was livestreamed on the Amazon-owned gaming platform Twitch.

The platform said it removed that video in less than two minutes, which was not fast enough to prevent copies of the clip from spreading to other social media sites. But the removal was considerably faster than the 17 minutes it took Facebook to take down a livestreamed attack in 2019 at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. That shooting killed 51 people.

Also in 2019, another gunman killed two people during a shooting at a German synagogue that was also livestreamed on Twitch.

Last June, two Muslim men in India were accused of slitting the throat of a Hindu tailor and posting a video of it online amid rising tensions between Hindus and Muslims in the country.

HOW HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CHANGED THEIR TACTICS?

The methods to curb attack videos have evolved since 2014, when Islamic State militants in Syria began sharing gruesome propaganda videos of the beheadings of kidnapped journalists and other hostages.

While those events were not shared live, it was “really the first time that there was a major terrorist incident designed for the social media era. And platforms realized that they had to do something,” said Courtney Radsch, a fellow at the UCLA Institute for Technology, Law & Policy.

Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube formed a group in 2017 called the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. Its mission expanded after the Christchurch killings “spurred a much more aggressive effort to not only eradicate” terrorist content online, but also to go after mass killing videos “perpetrated by white nationalists and other types of extremists,” said Radsch, who serves on a committee for the group.

The group, known as GIFCT, now has nearly two dozen members, including Amazon, Airbnb, Dropbox, Discord and Zoom. Whatever platform has the original video will submit a “hash” — a digital fingerprint corresponding to that video — and notify the other member companies so they can restrict it from their platforms. While not perfect, experts say the response has grown quicker and also now encompasses PDF files to stop the spread of manifestos.

“Unfortunately, as these have continued to occur, the more of these we’ve gone through with our members, the more everyone strengthened their muscle memory around this,” said Sarah Pollack, a spokesperson for GIFCT.

A day after the Louisville shooting, clips from the gunman’s livestream were not easily findable on Instagram or other popular social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook and TikTok. The first calls to police were around 8:30 a.m. Monday. By midday, the GIFCT had put out its highest-level alert for coordinating efforts to stop the video’s spread.

WHAT MORE COULD BE DONE?

It’s hard to know if the effort to slow the spread of videos has done anything to deter the violence itself.

“There’s a tension between platforms “wanting to give their users new capabilities and opportunities to engage” and the risks of livestreaming, said UCLA’s Radsch.

Livestreaming, “with no delay, with no real oversight, can present really challenging situations when users use your platform to livestream terrorism, extremism, violence, suicide.”

She said platforms still need to take more seriously whether to adopt additional precautions.

“The challenge is, any precaution you put in place for a mass violence event could also potentially be leveraged to prevent livestreaming of police brutality or pro-democracy protests,” she said. “So it really is a double-edged sword.”

Also, while mainstream companies are coordinating their response, they have little influence over the “dark web” forums that are still trying to collect and share the videos — other than preventing them from obtaining footage in the first place.",0
316,"Man United draws 2-2 with Sevilla; Varane, Martinez injured","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Two goals up and seemingly cruising toward the Europa League semifinals, Manchester United is now counting the cost of a late meltdown against Sevilla.

Own goals from Tyrell Malacia and Harry Maguire in the 84th and 92nd minutes on Thursday left the quarterfinals in the balance at 2-2 ahead of next week’s second leg in Spain.

Meanwhile, injuries to center backs Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez added to a bad night for Erik ten Hag.

The United manager is already without injured leading scorer Marcus Rashford at a critical point of the season. Bruno Fernandes is also suspended for the second leg after picking up his third yellow card of the competition.

“We had the game in our hands, we were 2-0 up and should have scored three or four, then we had some unlucky moments with injuries,” Ten Hag said. “I know we can do better in the last part of the game, we have to be more composed. We were a little bit unlucky defensively. It wasn’t a nice night.”

It was Sevilla’s visiting supporters who could be heard singing loudest at the final whistle, with Old Trafford stunned by the Spanish team’s fightback.

United can expect a hot reception at Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium next week after giving the Spaniards a lifeline at a time when they looked to be headed out of a competition they have dominated in recent times.

“It’s as we said at halftime: with one goal we get back in the tie and we were strong enough to keep going and to take our chances,” Sevilla coach Jose Luis Mendilibar said.

There is a reason why Sevilla has won the trophy six times between 2006-20 and that is because it finds a way through difficult moments.

And while it may sit 13th in the Spanish league, it refused to give up, despite being outplayed for the majority of the match.

Marcel Sabitzer scored in the 14th and 21st to give United a 2-0 halftime lead.

Antony hit the bar after the break, before Sevilla made Ten Hag’s team pay for failing to kill the game off, with Malacia turning Jesus Navas’ cross into his own net to spark the late comeback.

David de Gea pulled off a flying save to deny substitute Youssef En-Nesyri from equalizing in stoppage time. But Sevilla was soon celebrating when Maguire inadvertently diverted En-Nesyri’s header put past his own goalkeeper almost immediately after.

While Ten Hag must now lift his players after relinquishing control of the quarterfinals matchup, he may also have to plan ahead without key defenders.

Varane was substituted at halftime because of injury and Martinez looked in distress as he was carried off the field by Sevilla players Marcos Acuna and Gonzalo Montiel, his Argentina teammates, late on.

Ten Hag could not give details of severity of Martinez’s injury, but the player’s reaction — crouched over and covering his face with his hands on the sideline — appeared to show his own concern.

“I think he will not play on Sunday,” Ten Hag said. “It looks like that but I can’t say what is the diagnosis and I prefer to wait and then we are clear and know exactly what is it.”

United plays Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Sunday before the second leg against Sevilla on Thursday and the FA Cup semifinal against Brighton next weekend.

“I have an idea what we can play on Sunday,” Ten Hag said. “But first we have to see tomorrow and talk with medical (staff), see who came out of the game and then we have a plan and then we will bring a good team on pitch.”

Oussama Idrissi set up the goal in the 54th minute by breaking down the left before providing a precise cross for Wieffer in a victory that was a sweet revenge for the hosts.

The game was a rematch of last year’s final in the the inaugural edition of the third-tier Europa Conference League, which Roma won 1-0 for coach Jose Mourinho’s fifth European title.

Roma forwards Paulo Dybala and Tammy Abraham both left the game because of injuries.

Juventus had to rely on a late goal from defender Federico Gatti who scored from close range in the 73rd minute to secure three points and a 1-0 victory over Sporting Lisbon.

The goal came against the run of play as the Portuguese team looked ready to again upset the favorite after it eliminated English Premier League leader Arsenal in the previous round.

Florian Wirtz scored seven minutes from time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Leverkusen against Union Saint-Gilloise. Earlier in the second half, forward Victor Boniface scored his seventh goal of the campaign to put the Belgian team ahead.

West Ham’s perfect record in the Europa Conference League came to an end with a 1-1 draw at Gent. It had 10 wins in the third-tier competition, including qualifying.

Gent top scorer Hugo Cuypers salvaged the draw for the Belgian hosts, equalizing with his fifth goal in the competition this season 12 minutes into the second half.

Danny Ings tapped in a cross from Jarrod Bowen that came after a quickly taken throw-in by Vladimir Coufal to give the visitors a lead in the first-half stoppage time. It was the 30-year-old forward’s first European goal.

West Ham is still close to reaching a European semifinal for the second straight year after it was eliminated in the last four of the Europa League by the eventual winner Frankfurt last season.

The Hammers have been waiting for a European trophy since the 1965 title in the European Cup Winners’ Cup.

West Ham or Gent would meet Anderlecht or AZ Alkmaar in the the final four. Anderlecht won their first leg game 2-0 in Brussels.

Fiorentina will take home from Poland’s Lech Poznan a comfortable 4-1 advantage.

Basel was held at home 2-2 by Nice. Zeki Amdouni converted from the spot and added another for the hosts with Terem Moffi scoring both for the visitors.",0
317,California church must pay $1.2M for breaking COVID rules,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — A California church that defied safety regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic by holding large, unmasked religious services must pay $1.2 million in fines, a judge has ruled.

Calvary Chapel in San Jose was fined last week for ignoring Santa Clara County’s mask-wearing rules between November 2020 and June 2021.

The church will appeal, attorney Mariah Gondeiro told the San Jose Mercury News.

Calvary was one of several large California evangelical churches that flouted state and local mask-wearing and social distancing rules designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during its deadliest period.

That has led to a tangled web of court rulings and challenges.

Calvary Chapel sued the county, arguing the health orders violated its religious freedom. Various courts have ruled either in favor the church or the county.

The church and its pastors were previously held in contempt of court and fined for violating limits on indoor public gatherings. But a state appellate court reversed those decisions last year, saying that the restrictions on indoor worship services were stricter than for secular activities such as going to grocery stores.

The county continued to seek fines for violations of mask-wearing regulations.

“It should appear clear to all — regardless of religious affiliation — that wearing a mask while worshiping one’s god and communing with other congregants is a simple, unobtrusive, giving way to protect others while still exercising your right to religious freedom,” Superior Court Judge Evette D. Pennypacker wrote in the April 7 ruling imposing the fines.

The church, she said, flouted public health orders “and urged others to do so ‘who cares what the cost,’ including death.”

County Counsel James Williams said the ruling showed the court “once again saw through Calvary’s unsupported claims and found them meritless.”

“The county’s response to the pandemic, including the health officer’s public health orders and enforcement against entities that refused to follow the law, saved thousands of lives and resulted in one of the lowest death rates of any community in the United States,” Williams said.

More than 101,000 Californians have died from COVID-19, according to state public health figures. Death and infection rates have fallen since the height of the virus’ spread, and Gov. Gavin Newsom officially ended the state’s coronavirus emergency several months ago.

Last week, the California Department of Public Health ended masking and coronavirus vaccination requirements in high-risk settings, including health care facilities and prisons.",0
318,High-capacity magazine supplier sued in FedEx mass shooting,"The son of a man killed in a 2021 mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility filed a federal lawsuit Thursday with two of the survivors against the distributor of the 60-round magazine used by the gunman, alleging the use of reckless marketing tactics targeting young men at risk for violent behavior.

The lawsuit — filed almost exactly two years after the shooting that killed eight people — alleges that American Tactical, Inc. failed to take steps to help prevent dangerous people from obtaining the high-capacity magazine, which allow shooters to fire dozens of rounds without having to reload.

Instead, the lawsuit says the company specifically targeted its products to a “consumer base filled with impulsive young men who feel they need to harm others in order to prove their strength and who have militaristic delusions of fighting in a war or a video game.” It points to action-movie-style marketing videos that were posted on American Tactical’s YouTube page featuring men firing round after round in tactical vests — similar to one worn by the FedEx facility shooter.

“American Tactical, Inc. is well aware that these magazines are instruments of mass killing and have no problem marketing them directly to people with horrific intentions,” said Gurinder Singh Bains. whose father, Jaswinder Singh, died in the shooting.

“This isn’t a hypothetical. My father is gone because they didn’t care they were enabling mass shooters. They have to be held accountable not just for my father’s sake but everyone who may still suffer what my family and I have been forced to go through,” he said in an emailed statement.

The complaint also names as defendants the president of American Tactical, the company’s marketing director, as well as Schmeisser GmbH — the German manufacturer of the high-capacity magazine — and 365 Plus, the global distributor.

A person who answered the phone for American Tactical said the company had no immediate comment. Email seeking comment was sent to Schmeisser GmbH and 365 Plus.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York, where a law passed in 2021 opened the door to civil cases brought against the gun industry by classifying the illegal marketing and sale of firearms as a “public nuisance.”

The firearms industry has said that manufacturers aren’t at fault when people misuse their products, drawing a comparison to other products, like cars, that can also be used to hurt people.

Gunmakers are typically immune from lawsuits over crimes committed with their products under federal law, but survivors and families are increasingly seeking to hold the industry accountable by following in the footsteps of families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut.  They won a $73 million settlement from gunmaker Remington over marketing practices.

Last year, survivors of the mass shooting at a suburban Chicago Independence Day parade and family members of those killed filed 11 lawsuits against the manufacturer of the rifle used in the attack, accusing gun-maker Smith & Wesson of illegally targeting its ads at young men at risk of committing mass violence. And in November, the mother of a girl killed in the Uvalde, Texas school mass shooting similarly sued the maker of the AR-style semiautomatic rifle the gunman used to fire more than 100 rounds.

In addition to Jaswinder Singh’s son, other plaintiffs include two people who survived the shooting. Harpreet Singh was standing in line to pick up his paycheck when he was shot in the head. Lakhwinder Kaur was going to help a coworker who was slumped over when a bullet lacerated her arm, according to the lawsuit.

The 19-year-old gunman, Brandon Scott Hole, began firing randomly at people in the parking lot of the FedEx facility on April 15, 2021, killing four, before entering the building, killing four more people and then turning the gun on himself. The eight FedEx employees killed included four members of Indianapolis’ Sikh community.

The lawsuit says the shooter needed the high-capacity magazine to “accomplish his mission to kill and terrorize as many people as possible.” He was emboldened by “knowing he had the ability to fire 60 rounds continuously without the need to pause to reload,” the complaint says.

The lawsuit says American Tactical was obligated to take measures to minimize the risk that dangerous people like the shooter could obtain the product. Instead, anyone — “regardless of age, criminal history, or mental health history” — can buy high-capacity magazines like the one used by Hole directly from American Tactical’s website, the complaint says.

“Gun manufacturers and distributors know that high capacity magazines are favored by mass shooters due to their ability to kill as many people as possible, therefore American Tactical should have enacted reasonable safeguards to prevent such magazines from falling into the hands of those who should not have them,” said Kris Brown, president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which helped bring the lawsuit.

“They failed to do so, and these families are paying that price,” she added in her statement.

FedEx, which is not a party in the lawsuit, said Thursday in a statement that “April 15 will always be a somber day of reflection for our company as we continue to mourn our team members lost in the tragedy.”

“Providing a safe and secure work environment for our team members at all times remains our top priority,” the company continued.

319,Chinese soccer season set to start after 3 troubling years,"After three COVID 19-affected seasons, corruption and financial issues, Saturday’s start of the Chinese Super League marks a return to something approaching normal in the country’s soccer scene.

For the first time since the end of the 2019 season and the subsequent lockdowns, bio-secure bubbles in designated host cities and empty stadiums, fans will be able to watch their teams play at home and away.

Supporters will be present when defending champion Wuhan Three Towns plays against Shanghai Port on Saturday.

“The importance of this game is self-evident, and the team has been preparing for the new season well,” said Wuhan coach Pedro Morilla ahead of the season opener. “I am sure that the players will go all out tomorrow and play a wonderful game for the fans.”

Shanghai is, along with Wuhan, one of the few teams to be relatively unaffected by financial problems.

“I know the expectations are running high,” Shanghai chief Javier Pereira said. “What I really want is to get a trophy. We need to get back to winning ways.”

It will be a relief if the talk stays on soccer through 2023. Three years of severe lockdowns, no fans at games, reduced sponsorship and broadcasting revenue and a countrywide economic slowdown left many clubs, some of which spent tens of millions on famous foreign players and coaches in the previous decade, struggling to stay solvent.

In March, eight teams in the top three tiers of Chinese soccer, including CSL club Guangzhou City, were disqualified by the Chinese Football Association (CFA) from competing due to financial problems. In January Wuhan Yangtze folded after being unable to pay salaries, becoming the fourth top tier club to cease business in four seasons.

Chinese soccer is also going through one of its periodical clean-ups of soccer officials.

“There is still a long way to go to eradicate the existence of unhealthy practices such as football gambling and to strengthen the education and oversight of young officials,” the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the National Supervisory Commission said in December.

In March, the sports ministry announced probes into Wang Xiaoping, director of the Chinese Football Association’s Disciplinary Committee, and Huang Song of the body’s competition department as they were both “suspected of serious violations” of law and discipline. A month earlier, CFA president Chen Xuyuan was reportedly arrested on corruption charges.

“The soccer industry now has a number of problems, and it fails to live up to people’s expectations,” said Gao Zhidan, director of China’s General Administration of Sport in March. “Regarding the recent serious problems in the soccer sector, there’s a lot of soul-searching to do. … We must have systematic methods to tackle these problems bravely and fastidiously,”

It is a familiar story for fans but, after being starved of live soccer, will at least have something to take their minds off wider issues when the season begins..",0
320,"Snowmelt spurs flooding from Southwest to Rockies, 2 rescues","FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) — A rapid spring snowmelt after an unusually wet winter is unleashing flooding from the Southwest to the Rockies, causing residents there and in the Upper Midwest to evacuate or stock up on sandbags amid surging creeks and rivers.

In New Mexico, emergency crews rescued people from at least two vehicles from high water Thursday night in Jemez Pueblo north of Albuquerque, the National Weather Service said.

But there were no immediate reports of any deaths of serious injuries. A flood warning was in effect for communities along the Jemez River into next week.

In Flagstaff, Arizona, neighbors on one street have been working side by side since Tuesday with shovels to stave off floodwaters from their homes.

Three creek-retention basins installed last year helped better navigate water that rushed down from burned mountains above the city, officials said. Still, water engulfed the shoulder of a local highway, and several roads and sidewalks were closed this week as the weather warmed and snow melted, making its way into neighborhoods. Sections of urban trails also were submerged.

Officials said it was a scenario that came without a playbook.

“It would be nice to have an exact model of what we need to do, but we don’t,” Flagstaff Vice Mayor Austin Aslan told the Arizona Daily Sun. “We don’t know what the next fire will look like, or where that scar will be. There’s small differences that will direct water to one neighborhood or another.”

Sandoval County in north-central New Mexico issued an emergency disaster declaration in the wake of severe flooding in communities near the Jemez River.

No evacuations had been ordered, but residents in an area between Jemez Pueblo and Jemez Springs that regularly floods in the summer rainy season were collecting sandbags as a precaution. A local police chief estimated a dozen homes and other structures along the river could be at risk of being inundated with water.

“Warm temperatures continue to cause rapid melting of snowpack, causing increased river flows,” the National Weather Service in Albuquerque said Thursday night.

The deluge also led to spillover from a wastewater treatment plant, which was contributing recycled water into the Jemez River. The U. S. Forest Service advised people not to fish in the river or drink water south of the plant.

In Salt Lake City, Mayor Erin Mendenhall signed an emergency order late Wednesday aimed at helping residents whose homes were threatened by flooding in the southeastern part of the city. Rapidly melting snow in the nearby mountains sent water coursing through a creek in the neighborhood, prompting the voluntary evacuation of about 100 homes.

The water was receding as cooler weather moved into the area. Even so, multiple mudslides were reported on canyon roads, including one that forced the temporary closure of Interstate 80 southeast of the city early Thursday.

On Wednesday, local officials north of Salt Lake City issued evacuation orders for at least 20 homes in Kaysville, where flooding ripped a large gash that damaged a street, sidewalks and driveways in a subdivision that was under construction.

Meanwhile, heavy snowpack and highs expected to reach 60 degrees Thursday were causing flooding in northwest Colorado, where transportation officials closed Highway 40 between Craig and Steamboat Springs, a popular ski area that has received more than 400 inches (1,016 centimeters) of snow this winter.

Flooding in the small mountain town of Hayden forced schools to close. Rain was in the forecast Thursday afternoon, with the expectation of turning to snow overnight.

The Colorado Department of Transportation posted photos online showing Dry Creek spilling over its banks at a bridge there, as well as floodwater threatening several parked recreational vehicles.

The National Weather Service said some roads might become impassable during the weekend and urged motorists not to drive through flooded crossings.

There were no reports of major damage, however, in Utah or Colorado as of Thursday.

In the Northern Plains, a speedy snowmelt and possible April showers stoked fears of heavy flooding. Residents have been assembling thousands — if not hundreds of thousands — of sandbags to hold back water.

The Red River Valley, which includes Fargo in North Dakota and Moorhead in Minnesota, had one of the snowiest winters on record. Heavy rain could cause the river to rise quickly, Moorhead city engineer Bob Zimmerman told Minnesota Public Radio.

Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said Thursday at a news conference that the state is ready to respond with financial help for flooding if needed.

He added that warmer temperatures and rising waters from climate change have factored into the state’s months-long preparation for the spring flooding season.

Local, state and federal public safety and emergency management partners have ramped up monitoring and preparation efforts, according to the state’s Department of Public Safety.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has declared a statewide emergency for spring flooding, and he made the National Guard available to help fight floods in the coming weeks, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The city of Bismarck opened sites for residents to fill their own sandbags.

In northern Montana, the Milk River was expected to rise to its highest level in more than a decade and swamp some rural areas.

Emergency officials along the river in Glasgow were patrolling the levee protecting the city of about 3,200 people to make sure it held up, said Valley County Disaster and Emergency Services coordinator Rick Seiler. Shelters were being arranged in case low-lying areas need evacuations.

The flooding was forecast to continue through next week, according to the National Weather Service.

Heavy rain was falling across the region on Thursday while snow continued to pile up at higher elevations, Seiler said.

321,Why are there so many good TV shows to watch right now?,"Picture May 17, 2001. In the final seconds of the season seven finale of “Friends,” Jennifer Aniston’s Rachel reveals she’s pregnant — but who’s the father? This was a classic May sweeps cliffhanger, luring viewers and reaping advertising dollars for NBC.

Most shows used to kick off in the fall, air big episodes in November and February, and go out with a bang in May. Baby announcements, marriage proposals and sudden deaths were just a few of the popular plot twists used in spring season finales to hook viewers and build anticipation for the fall season.

Network television still largely follows that model, but the streamers and premium cable competitors of the new guard tend to operate with different goals. Rather than angling for ratings, those companies are releasing new seasons of popular TV shows — “Ted Lasso,” “Succession,” “The Mandalorian,” “ The Last of Us,” and “ Yellowjackets ” — with an eye to Primetime Emmy Award recognition.

Everyone wants to be fresh in the minds of voters, said Joyce Eng, a senior editor of the Hollywood awards-centric website Gold Derby.

“A lot of networks, streamers and campaigners will capitalize on recency bias,” she said.

For a TV series to be eligible for a Primetime Emmy, it must air between June 1 and May 31 of the following year. Six episodes of a returning season need to air by May 31 to qualify for a series category. The cast and crew then cross their fingers for nominations, which this year will be announced July 12, followed by the Emmy telecast on September 18, when the awards are handed out.

Limited series have to air all their episodes by May 31 in order to be eligible for nomination. In March, Amazon Prime’s highly anticipated “ Daisy Jones & The Six ” dropped its 10 episodes in four batches.

It can be a scramble for shows to finish by the end of May: “Ted Lasso” on Apple TV+ drops its final episode of season three, and maybe the entire series, on May 31. The fifth and final season of “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” returns on Amazon on April 14 and swiftly wraps by May 26.

If a returning series does not release six episodes of its season by the May 31 deadline, the remaining “hanging” episodes can be nominated in categories that only require a single episode to enter, such as guest actor.

Season three of “The Handmaid’s Tale” premiered June 5, 2019 — which was too late for Emmy eligibility that year. Rather than sit the year out though, “they found a loophole,” Eng said. They submitted three episodes that had aired in 2018 during the previous season for individual achievement categories, and earned 11 nominations.

When it comes to scheduling, network and streamer executives maintain tight control over the release-date calendar.

“They choose when we go,” said Rob Eric, chief creative officer and executive producer of Scout Productions, behind the Emmy-winning reality series “Queer Eye.” This year, he has four series premiering right before the deadline.

“We can make suggestions, but really they’re in charge of how that rollout looks,” he said of the platforms.

Release dates are not always entirely about potential accolades.

“Sometimes a series is released because it’s timely and speaks to what’s happening in the world,” said Tony Phelan, who created “A Small Light” with Joan Rater. The NatGeo series tells the story of Miep Gies, who helped hide Anne Frank and her family.

“It’s in direct response to what’s happening in the world, specifically in America in terms of division and the rise in nationalism and antisemitism,” Phelan said of the show.

Still, to end the show in time for award eligibility, “ A Small Light ” will release two episodes each week on National Geographic, premiering May 1 and ending May 31.

“How did that happen?” Phelan asked in mock surprise of the reason behind the show’s timeline.

It should be noted that shows released in late summer and fall can still garner attention from awards committees — just a little later. Netflix dropped all nine episodes of “Squid Game” in September 2021 — and it was still nominated for last year’s Emmy Awards, including best drama series. Lee Jung-jae also won best actor in a drama series, making history as the first person to win in the drama category for a non-English speaking role.

The critically acclaimed and popular series “The Bear” debuted its first season last June, but it was too late for the 2022 Emmy Awards. By premiering in the summer though, the Hulu show shined and wasn’t drowned out by competitors. And the Emmy Awards aren’t everything: Star Jeremy Allen White cleaned up at the Golden Globes, where he won best actor in a musical or comedy series.

“There are just so many shows, so many streaming services, and people don’t have the time,” Eng said. “From the studio and network standpoint, maybe you should pull something like ‘The Bear’ and drop it in the summer and build that momentum because that was a word-of-mouth hit.”

Eric Korsh, the president of Scout Productions, distilled the value of award recognition: The Emmys, he said, “are about defining the best in television.”

322,"Climate change adding 50 homers a year in MLB, study says","Climate change is making major league sluggers into even hotter hitters, sending an extra 50 or so home runs a year over the fences, a new study found.

Hotter, thinner air that allows balls to fly farther contributed a tiny bit to a surge in home runs since 2010, according to a statistical analysis by Dartmouth College scientists published in Friday’s Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. They analyzed 100,000 major league games and more than 200,000 balls put into play in the last few years along with weather conditions, stadiums and other factors.

“Global warming is juicing home runs in Major League Baseball,” said study co-author Justin Mankin, a Dartmouth climate scientist.

When air heats up, molecules move faster and away from each other, making the air less dense. Baseballs launched off a bat go farther through thinner air because there’s less resistance to slow the ball. Just a little bit farther can mean the difference between a homer and a flyout, said Alan Nathan, a University of Illinois physicist who wasn’t part of the Dartmouth study.

Nathan, one of a group of scientists who has consulted with Major League Baseball on the increase in homers, did his own simple calculation, based purely on known physics of ballistics and air density as it changes with temperature, and said he got the same result as the Dartmouth researchers.

Both Nathan and the Dartmouth team found a 1% increase in home run likelihood with every degree the air warms (1.8% with each degree Celsius). Total yearly average of warming-aided homers is only 1% of all home runs hit, the Dartmouth researchers calculated.

Non-climate factors contribute even more to the barrage of balls flying out of the park, scientists and baseball veterans said. The biggest is the ball and the size of the stitches, Nathan said, and MLB made slight adjustments to deaden the ball prior to the 2021 season. Others include batters’ recent attention to launch angle; stronger hitters; and faster pitches. The study started after the end of baseball’s infamous steroids era saw a spike in home runs.

Veteran baseball players and executives said the research fits with what they’ve seen on the field.

“We always felt that way for years,” Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said. “When it’s warmer, the ball travels more and they have scientific evidence to back that up.”

Homers have always varied by ballpark due to simple factors like dimensions that are friendlier to pitchers than hitters, or vice versa, as well as wind conditions.

The Dartmouth team found the climate homer effect varied by field, too. Chicago’s Wrigley Field, which still hosts a lot of day games, has the most warming-homer friendly confines. The statistical analysis found no significant heat-aided homers at Tampa’s Tropicana Field, the only full-time domed stadium in Major League Baseball.

“It’s interesting to think about,” said five-time All-Star pitcher David Cone, who once threw a perfect game and is now a television baseball analyst. “I’d probably more likely look at the makeup of the baseball itself, the variances and the specs. Of course, weather matters, definitely I wouldn’t shoo it away.”

After a 1-0 victory in Coors Field, Colorado Rockies reliever Brent Suter said the study, which mentions more than 500 home runs since 2010, rings true to him.

“Obviously I’m not a fan in any way as a pitcher,” Suter said with a laugh. “500 seems a lot, but I could believe it.”

The heat is also hard on players and fans, Suter said: “I remember pitching some games I was just, like ‘This does not feel like normal heat. It’s crazy hot.’”

The average U. S. temperature in June, July and August has increased by more than 2 degrees (1.1 degrees Celsius) in the last 40 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Mankin called what’s happening “a fingerprint of climate change on our recreation.” Callahan said what’s been seen so far is nothing compared to projections of hundreds of extra homers in the future.

How many extra homers depends on how hot it gets, which depends on how much greenhouse gas the world spews from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Callahan ran different scenarios of carbon pollution through computer simulations.

In the worst-case warming trajectory – which some scientists say the world is no longer on based on recent emissions – there would be about 192 warming-aided homers a year by 2050 and around 467 hot home runs by the year 2100. In more moderate carbon pollution scenarios, closer to where Earth is now tracking, there would be about 155 warming-aided homers a year by 2050 and around 255 extra dingers at the end of the century, Callahan said.

Because baseball has so many statistics and analytics, such as the tracking system Statcast, trends can be seen more easily than other effects of climate change, Mankin said. Still, the scientists can’t point to a single homer and say that’s a warming-aided home run. It’s a detail that can be only seen in the more than 63,000 homers hit since 2010.

Several climate scientists told The Associated Press that the study makes perfect sense and the statistics are analyzed properly, though they also point out factors other than climate change are in play and likely have bigger effects.

Both Texas A&M’s Andrew Dessler and University of Illinois’ Don Wuebbles said while the rise in home runs is interesting, it pales next to the issues of extreme weather and rising seas.

But Callahan said it actually brings home the threat of climate change in a unique way. Besides resulting in more home runs, a warming climate will likely require more domed stadiums because it will simply be too hot outside for humans in some places.

“Global warming is going to reshape so many of the things that we care about in so many pernicious and subtle ways,” Callahan said. “And the fact that we’ll get to go to fewer baseball games played in open air is not a civilization-ending crisis, but it is another sign of the way that we have reshaped our lives due to our greenhouse gas emissions.”

323,Judge who sentenced Parkland shooter removed from other case,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The judge who oversaw the sentencing of the Parkland massacre gunman was removed from another death penalty murder case Thursday by the Florida Supreme Court, which agreed she showed unfair sympathy for prosecutors in the Parkland school shooting case.

The court removed Judge Elizabeth Scherer from overseeing any post-conviction proceedings for Randy Tundidor, who was sentenced to death for the 2019 murder of his Broward County landlord and is appealing his case.

Justices cited Scherer’s chummy interactions with prosecutors who were seeking the death penalty against Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz during sentencing.

“Immediately after sentencing Cruz, Judge Scherer left the bench and, while still in her judicial robe, exchanged hugs with the victims’ families and members of the prosecution team,” the justices said in their unanimous decision.

Judges are supposed to remain neutral during trials and sentencing.

One of the prosecutors in Tundidor’s case was also on the team that prosecuted Cruz.

Scherer had no choice but to sentence Cruz to life in prison with no parole after the jury couldn’t reach a legally-required unanimous decision on recommending the death penalty.

The state Legislature passed a bill later Thursday that will allow the death penalty when at least 8 of 12 jurors recommend it. The measure was filed as a response to the Parkland case. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis supports the bill.

The Supreme Court said Scherer also engaged in heated exchanges with Cruz’s lawyers, accused one of threatening her children, and told two members to “go sit down.”",0
324,"Lazio at Spezia, Lyon visits Toulouse","A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Friday:

Lazio hopes to solidify its second-place spot in Serie A when it visits Spezia. Napoli is likely out of reach at the top of the table but Lazio wants to hold off third-place Roma and is on a seven-game unbeaten run in the league. Spezia enters the match one spot and four points above the relegation zone. Cremonese hosts Empoli in the other game. The hosts are in the drop zone, just one point above last-place Sampdoria.

Osasuna visits Rayo Vallecano with both teams needing a win to boost their slim chances of finishing the season with a European competition berth. Osasuna is in eighth place with Rayo one point behind in ninth. In Spain this season, the top four finishers go to the Champions League, the fifth-place team to the Europa League, and the sixth-place team to the Europa Conference League. Osasuna is seven points behind Betis, which is currently in sixth. But Osasuna can win a direct pass to the Europa League if it beats Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final next month.

It’s a meeting of two former giants now facing relegation from the Bundesliga as Schalke plays Hertha Berlin. They are the bottom two in the table with seven games remaining and dropping out of the top division would be a major blow to either club. Schalke is in its first season since promotion after a relegation in 2021 and Hertha has not been outside of the top flight since 2013.

Lyon visits mid-table Toulouse looking to record a third straight league win and maintain its outside chance of securing a Europa League spot. Lyon is in seventh place but victory would move it level on points with sixth-place Rennes. Striker Alexandre Lacazette has scored consistently since rejoining Lyon from Premier League club Arsenal and has netted 18 league goals. He needs one more to move level at the top of the scoring charts with Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappé and Lille’s Jonathan David.",0
325,"HARDY, Lainey Wilson lead ACM Awards nominees","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Country artist HARDY drove the success of his hit song “Wait in the Truck” with Lainey Wilson all the way to the Academy of Country Music Awards, where he is the leading nominee.

And his duet partner was not far behind, as “Yellowstone” actor and singer-songwriter Wilson earned six nominations including female artist of the year and album of the year during nominations announced Thursday.

The awards show will be held in Frisco, Texas, on May 11, hosted by Dolly Parton and Garth Brooks and airing on Prime Video.

Among Hardy’s seven nominations are two in the song of the year category: “Wait in the Truck” and “Sand in My Boots,” a song performed by Morgan Wallen and co-written by HARDY, Ashley Gorley and Josh Osborne.

The most awarded artist in ACM history made another record when Miranda Lambert received her 17th female artist of the year nomination. She surpassed Reba McEntire, who had 16 nominations in that category, and Lambert, the Texas native, has four other nominations this year, including entertainer of the year and album of the year for the critical favorite “Palomino.”

Nominees for entertainer of the year include Lambert, Wallen, Luke Combs, Jason Aldean, Kane Brown, Chris Stapleton and Carrie Underwood. Ashley McBryde and Jon Pardi are nominated alongside Wilson, Combs and Lambert for album of the year.

Female artist of the year nominees are Kelsea Ballerini, Lambert, McBryde, Carly Pearce and Wilson. Male artist of the year nominees are Brown, Combs, Jordan Davis, Stapleton and Wallen.",0
326,Blackhawks say Toews will not return to team next season,"CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews will not return to the team next year, ending a wildly successful run that included three Stanley Cup championships in 15 seasons.

General manager Kyle Davidson said Thursday that the team will not re-sign its longtime center, who turns 35 on April 29. He is eligible for free agency after agreeing to an $84 million, eight-year contract extension in July 2014.

“I think words fail to adequately summarize everything that Jonathan’s done for the organization, the amazing memories that he provided,” Davidson said. “He’ll be a Blackhawk forever.”

Chicago hosts Philadelphia in its season finale on Thursday night. Toews won his first championship when the Blackhawks beat the Flyers in the 2010 Stanley Cup Final.

Long known for his two-way play and leadership, Toews has 14 goals and 16 assists in 52 games this year. He has 371 goals and 511 assists in 1,066 regular-season games — all with Chicago.

Once nicknamed “Captain Serious” — a reputation that faded away as he showed more of his personality over the years — Toews could decide to retire after missing a chunk of this season with what he described as symptoms of long COVID-19 and chronic immune response syndrome. He also missed the 2020-21 season because of those same health issues.

“I don’t really have an answer right now,” he said Monday. “I’m just trying to enjoy the last few days of the season here with this group and not thinking that far ahead.”

Davidson said he thinks Toews is going to play next season. “But that’s a conversation for him,” the GM said.

Toews was selected by Chicago with the No. 3 pick in the 2006 draft, one of the first markers in the team’s rise to the top of the NHL. He was just 20 years old when he became the 34th captain in team history in July 2008.

“He’s definitely our team leader, and he’s been the leader here for a long time,” first-year coach Luke Richardson said. “It was always fun to watch him play. I was always a fan, but to have a chance to work with him this year was absolutely amazing.”

Toews was part of a core group that helped Chicago put together the best stretch in franchise history, winning the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. The Blackhawks also made it to the Western Conference finals in 2014, losing to the Los Angeles Kings in an epic seven-game series.

But the franchise has fallen on hard times of late. It is among the worst teams in the NHL this year, in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick in the draft and a chance to take Connor Bedard.

Toews’ departure comes in the wake of a February trade that shipped star forward Patrick Kane to the New York Rangers.

“I don’t know if it’s necessarily putting the past behind us. It’s moreso clearing the deck to some extent to allow the organic growth for young players into leadership roles,” Davidson said. “Offer this new era of Blackhawks player the same opportunity that Toews, Kane, (Duncan) Keith, (Brent) Seabrook, they were all offered when they came in the league.”

Following a series of conversations, Davidson said he told Toews of the decision while the team was in Seattle last week. The GM also said he had talked to CEO Danny Wirtz, the son of Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz, about the move.

“Danny and Rocky spoke with Jonathan, not about this, just to kind of reminisce about what was lived and experienced and just to show that respect and share in the memories that were made together,” Davidson said. “So, when you’re moving on from someone like Jonathan Toews, they have to be involved. They have to be, given the status and stature of the player.”",0
327,"Judge rejects Trump rape trial delay, but grants concessions","NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge rejected a request Thursday to delay former President Donald Trump’s trial this month on civil claims that he raped a woman in the mid-1990s, but he has granted a request by Trump’s lawyers to gather more evidence about who is paying the accuser’s lawyers.

New revelations that a major contributor to Democrats helped finance the litigation against Trump by columnist E. Jean Carroll prompted attorney Alina Habba to ask for a one-month delay of the April 25 trial.

Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said he would allow lawyers for Trump to gather more information and to question Carroll for up to one hour about why she said in an October deposition that her lawyers were relying on a contingency fee in the case and were not receiving other income.

Habba’s request is the second time this week that a Trump lawyer has asked to delay the trial on Carroll’s allegations that Trump raped her in 1996 in a upscale Manhattan department store dressing room.

Earlier this week, Trump attorney Joe Tacopina asked for a one-month delay, saying adverse publicity over Trump’s arrest last week on criminal charges in New York state court made a delay necessary.

Trump has denied that he raped Carroll and has accused the former longtime Elle magazine advice columnist and her lawyer of being politically driven after Carroll disclosed her claims for the first time publicly in a 2019 memoir while Trump was still president.

In her letter to the court Thursday, Habba said Carroll’s lawyers had disclosed for the first time this week that they had received funding from American Future Republic, a social welfare organization funded by Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn.

Habba wrote that the revelation raises significant questions about Carroll’s credibility and motives for suing Trump in November after New York state enacted a law allowing victims more time to sue those who committed sexual abuse against them, even if it happened decades ago.

Habba said it also goes to the heart of Trump’s defense because he has consistently labeled Carroll’s claims a “con job” and a “hoax” and has questioned whether she is pushing a political agenda or being funded by a rival political party.

Hoffman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, responded in a letter to the court Thursday, asking the judge to deny Trump’s latest bid for a delay to the trial.

“One thing is clear — Trump will stop at nothing to avoid having a jury hear Carroll’s claims,” she wrote.

Kaplan said her client was preparing for trial recently when she recalled hearing that her lawyers, who were operating on a contingency fee basis, had also secured funding from a nonprofit organization. Carroll’s lawyers then notified Trump’s lawyers, who demanded to know the source of the funding.

Meanwhile, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals released a written opinion Thursday providing additional legal insight that the 2nd U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals can use to decide if the United States can be substituted for Trump as the defendant in a defamation lawsuit Carroll filed before her November rape lawsuit.

The 2nd Circuit had asked the D. C. court to provide insight into a law addressing when an employer should be liable for the actions of its employee.

The D. C. court said it lacked facts to recommend whether it believed that allegedly libelous statements Trump made after Carroll’s rape claims became public fell within the scope of his employment as president.

It did attempt to clarify the law, though it noted that most of its case law on the subject pertained to disputes over whether law enforcement individuals could be held personally liable.

The defamation lawsuit eventually will be dismissed if the United States is substituted as a defendant, and a trial might become unnecessary otherwise because the November rape lawsuit also contains a defamation claim against Trump.",0
328,"Moves, music, risk elevate a skating hybrid","SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — This winter’s been a hard one in Southern California. Highways flood and the rain keeps coming. Pedestrians pick their way across fallen cypress trees, around puddles on sidewalks roped off with caution tape. Between fire, flood, and drought, sometimes it feels like the end of the world.

But tonight, there’s a break. Just east of the Santa Monica boardwalk, a dozen or so longboarders cruise in loping patterns along the empty stretch of South Lot 4, a mostly empty parking area.

Hannah Dooling glides down the pavement, earbuds hidden by long brown hair tucked beneath a baseball cap. She steps off her longboard, flips it in a semi-circle in the air while taking a few running steps, and hops back on the board, landing with a resounding thud.

It is, in fact, really cool. The trick is the half moon, named for the arc the board makes in the sky, and it’s one that Dooling, 30, has shown other women how to master. They include Yun Huang, a 33-year-old tech worker, and Jane Kang and Christie Goodman, both 29, who work as a nanny and real estate agent, respectively.

They’re all here in wide-leg pants and zero-drop sneakers for the longboard session, bundled against the wind in hoodies, puffer coats or trucker jackets.

They get together most Saturday and Sunday afternoons if the weather’s good, at meetups supported by Dancing Foundation, a non-profit started with a matching grant from Google by Achille Brighton, a 39-year-old software engineer.

Longboard dance is still in its infancy, but Brighton says it has already spread — here, in Paris, in Seoul — anywhere with public squares or wide, open sidewalks where people can watch.

“You don’t need skate parks. You just need roads,” he says. “And because you do it in public, you’re out there, people see it. And they’re like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of cool.’”

Originally designed for surfers entertaining themselves between sets, most longboards range from 3 to 4 feet in length, about a foot longer than traditional skateboards. The longer decks can be cumbersome, but also graceful. They’re used for carving sidewalk turns and bombing hills, as well as longboard dancing, a skate/dance hybrid that fuses movement, music and danger.

“When you’re doing longboard dancing, you’re listening to music, typically, and you’re moving your body to the beat,” Brighton says. “There’s this effect where the rest of the world melts away. And I think that is like one of the things that gets you addicted.”

Dooling was an early adopter, learning how to skate in Seattle. If anyone wants to learn a trick, she can probably show them how. She works remotely for Amazon and moved to L. A. with her partner in 2021 during “peak COVID,” not knowing anyone. Skating was a way to find community.

Huang, a native of Melbourne, Australia, started skating during the pandemic. Some days, her board and her dog were the only things that would get her outdoors and moving.

“We were all kind of depressed from COVID,” she says. “I tried meditation before. That didn’t work for me, but I felt like I could really be in the zone with this.”

At first, Huang just wanted to learn how to skate. Then she got sucked into “the longboard dancing hole of Instagram,” where a 30-second clip can be posted with music. That’s how Huang learned about Brighton and Longboard Dancing Los Angeles.

Says Dooling: “As a woman, skating can feel intimidating and not welcoming.” But during the pandemic, people were connecting through social media, finding their niche.

Longboard dance was featured in a commercial for Facebook Groups during the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics, showing skaters of different genders, races and nationalities finding each other online. You could watch reels and think, “I identify, or I see myself, or connect with the people that I’m seeing doing this,” Dooling says.

Goodman, flashing a “rock on” sign with her index and pinky finger, says, “I was like, Tony Hawk!” The women laugh, but Goodman is semi-serious. “Yeah! I was obsessed with him! And now I’m like, I can do some of those tricks!”

The four women jump in and out of conversation, their speech overlapping. Kang is the most reticent, a former dancer attracted to the sport’s grace. Dooling is unassuming yet self-assured, a quietly rebellious “solo sporter” who grew up snowboarding and practicing Tae Kwan Do. Huang, also a snowboarder, sports a sea-green manicure and dark hair balayaged into blonde.

Goodman is animated, her long red hair moving with her as she gesticulates.

“Don’t laugh at me, I’m fulfilling my 12-year-old dreams, OK?” she says.

Goodman first stepped on a skateboard in 2021. Now she’s sponsored, as is Huang.

Goodman does downhill, descending inclines at rapid speed. It’s dangerous; it’s exciting; “it brings up all the emotions,” she says.

The thing that ties together longboarding and longboard dancing is danger, Brighton says. You might miss a step; you might fall; you might get hurt, he says. “And that’s the exciting bit.”

Brighton has ADHD and falls on the autism spectrum, he says. Longboarding attracts a neurodiverse community, says Goodman, who also has ADHD. “It’s, like, seeking that adrenaline,” she says.

On a longboard, Brighton says, he doesn’t have to try to concentrate. It’s built into the movement. If you don’t pay attention, you’re going to get hurt, he says.

“You’re on a board. Your brain now needs to learn not only where the body is, but also where the board is, and how the board is moving with relation to the ground,” he says. Longboarders “jump in and out of two different planes of movement… You need to be able to keep track of those two states.”

When one of the women lands a new trick, “we fully celebrate,” Goodman says. They hang out after sessions, walking up to Samosa House on Main St., Jameson’s, or Venice Beach Bar, which you can skate down to.

The sun is lowering on the horizon, which is thick with clouds. The sand has turned gray and damp. Waves and wind have pushed sand onto the boardwalk, where it swirls and drifts in marbled patterns punctuated by footsteps, stroller wheels, and the tire patterns of a bike caravan glowing with LED lights, revolutions of pink and green slowly cycling towards the Ferris wheel.

The women, shivering in ripped jeans, want to make the most of the light that’s left. “We need to move,” Huang says, and, laughing, they glide off into the sunset.",0
329,Small business owners feel the credit crunch,"NEW YORK (AP) — When Nat West, owner of cider-making company Reverend Nat’s Hard Cider, decided to supplement his wholesale business by opening a taproom in a bustling neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, he thought getting financing would be a breeze.

After all, he was only seeking $50,000, has been in business for 11 years, and takes in more than $1 million in annual revenue.

In February and March, West reached out to three lenders he had previously gotten financing from, including one where he has an existing line of credit. To his surprise, he was rejected.

“I feel like it’s really weird, it’s such a small amount of money for a business that has so much ongoing, sustained revenue and has been in the same community for a long time,” he said.

West isn’t alone. Borrowing for small businesses was already constrained due to rising interest rates. Following the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, some lenders – particularly the small and midsize banks that serve small businesses -- may be forced to tighten credit further, since they’re seeing an outflow of deposits, which means they need to retain capital. And banks are being more cautious in general due to uncertainty about the economy.

“It’s hard to read how severe this is going to be, but it’s certainly going to be significant and when you look at how things play out, small businesses are hit the hardest,” said Ray Keating, chief economist for the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council.

According to the latest Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index released in February, the approval rates of small business loan requests at big banks have fallen for nine consecutive months. The larger banks approved just 14.2% of applications in February, down from 28.3% in February 2020. Small banks granted about 20% of loan applications this February, but they were approving about half of all requests back in early 2020, before the pandemic hit.

An overall tightening of credit will help slow down the economy and ease inflation, which is what the Federal Reserve hopes to achieve by hiking interest rates, said Rohit Arora, CEO and co-founder of Biz2Credit. But that means that small businesses -- a big job creator and source of innovation for the economy -- will be left in the lurch.

“It will be the small companies that suffer the most if this continues,” he said.

Basic Fun, a Boca Raton, Florida-based maker of such toys as Care Bears and Lincoln Logs, had to temporarily scuttle plans for an acquisition due to the crunch. CEO Jay Foreman said he was ready to go with non-binding agreements with 12 of the prospective 23 lenders lined up in late February and early March. But that number shrank to two after Silicon Valley Bank failed and triggered the recent banking turmoil.

“It’s just not the right timing now as lenders appear unclear about the broader credit markets and seem to be clutching the purse strings tightly at this point,” Foreman said. “We just have to ride this out until conditions are right to arrange the proper financing for our acquisition.”

Companies that have existing lines of credit are seeing interest rates increase. James Carron, who operates Flatirons Pharmaceuticals, in Longmont, Colorado, has seen rates increase for his line of credit that’s about $150,000. Before the pandemic, the rate was 6.99%, but that went up to 10%. Now it’s 13% and rapidly approaching 14%. Other potential lenders he contacted had even higher rates.

So, Carron said he’s put off the purchase of two servers and additional hardware security upgrades that he had planned for the first half of this year. He’s monitoring the economy now to see when he might be able to make the purchases.

A credit crunch affects small businesses more than larger ones, he said, because smaller businesses have fewer levers they can pull to get financing.

“We can’t issue corporate bonds or have other money available to us,” he said. “Large corporations have multiple avenues for them to secure reasonable rates for funding. A small business owner doesn’t have that ability.”

In the U. K., Dawn Barber has delayed some expansion plans because credit terms have gotten stricter. Barber is the founder and managing director at Web Shop Direct, which runs the online fashion brands UK Tights and UK Swimwear. She noted that her business has done well all through the pandemic, as her customers are looking to splurge on little luxuries.

Barber said that her business -- which generates annual revenue of 2.5 million pounds ($3.1 million) -- is essentially self-funded but when she recently turned to PayPal for extra funding, the financial terms were stricter compared to a year ago. Barber wanted to borrow 150,000 pounds ($186,195) but learned that she would get charged 10,000 pounds ($12,416) upfront, instead of the usual 6,000 pounds ($7,449) and that she needed to pay within six months, instead of nine months.

She decided the terms were too steep. She’s put a hold on officially launching a new line of wellness products, which includes loungewear and candles and was expected to account for 20% of her annual sales.

As for West, the Oregon cider-maker, he had to put $10,000 on his personal credit card to finance the new taproom, which is open. He’s still short of what he needs, but that will keep the taproom running for now, he said.

“I’m super thankful I can put it together,” he said. “A lot of people will just have to put their dreams on hold.”",0
330,Manchester United fans growing impatient for sale of club,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Nearly five months after the Glazer family put Manchester United on the market, the iconic soccer club’s fans are growing impatient as the proposed sale goes on.

Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe are both hoping to take control of the 20-time English league champions and submitted second bids last month.

American investment firm Elliott Management could also take a minority stake as well as provide capital to other potential buyers, with the price possibly rising as high as $6 billion.

But the ongoing wait to get a deal done has supporters worried the club’s offseason transfer plans will be impacted at a time when manager Erik ten Hag hopes to sign a world class striker. Harry Kane and Victor Osimhen are among the names linked and neither would come cheap.

Following reports that there will be a third round of bids, the Manchester United Supporters Trust said Thursday the uncertainty was of “great concern.”

“Erik needs to know what resources he has to spend so he can make the signings the club needs, and the whole management resources of the club need to be focused on supporting him in that,” MUST said in a statement. “That cannot be the case with the future ownership so unclear.”

United’s American owners announced last November that they would consider selling the club as they explored “strategic alternatives.”

That appeared to pave the way for their departure after years of resisting supporters’ attempts to drive them out.

Based on the public bids, Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe appear to be the leading contenders, with the Raine Group merchant bank handling the process.

But there is increasing frustration as the wait for a new owner goes on.

“Shoddy way to run a sale process. They need to get out by end of May to allow the new owner a fighting chance to impact the next transfer window and get moving!” former United captain and now TV pundit Gary Neville tweeted this week.

United declined to comment on MUST’s statement. In Thursday’s Europa League quarterfinals first leg against Sevilla at Old Trafford, United fans continued to voice their frustration, chanting “We want Glazers out” after Marcel Sabitzer scored early in the first half.

Sheikh Jassim is the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and is son of a former prime minister.

He has promised to rid the club of debt, invest in the stadium, training center and playing squads in a bid to “return the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch.”

Ratcliffe is the owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS and is one of Britain’s richest people. He was born in Failsworth, Greater Manchester and says he is focused on United winning the Champions League and becoming the “number one club in the world once again.”

Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus said Wednesday that he was no longer interested.

Any new owner is also likely to have to spend in the region of $1 billion to redevelop or rebuild United’s Old Trafford stadium.

“We are in dire need of new investment, which undoubtedly requires new ownership,” the supporters trust said. “Along with United fans all around the world, (we) are calling for this process to be concluded without further delay.”",0
331,Doctor acquitted in 14 patient deaths sues health system,"DETROIT (AP) — An Ohio doctor acquitted in the deaths of 14 patients who died after they were given painkillers has filed a lawsuit against a national Catholic health system that operates the hospital where he worked in the intensive care unit.

William Husel claims malicious prosecution and names Trinity Health Corp. in a complaint filed Wednesday in federal court in Detroit. He is seeking a jury trial and at least $20 million in damages.

Husel was accused of ordering painkillers for patients in the Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl.

Prosecutors in that case had said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them.

A jury found Husel not guilty of 14 counts of murder in April 2022.

Husel was fired in late 2018 from Mount Carmel West Hospital, a member of Trinity Health. He later was indicted on 25 murder counts. Eleven of those counts were dismissed by county prosecutors in January 2022.

Husel “voluntary relinquished his license to practice medicine,” according to the federal lawsuit.

“Dr. Husel understood that, notwithstanding the acquittal, the reputation damage he endured would prevent him from ever working as a doctor,” the complaint said.

A separate defamation lawsuit against Trinity is awaiting trial in Ohio’s Franklin County, according to Husel’s attorney, Robert Landy of the New York-based Ford O’Brien Landy law firm.

That lawsuit was filed while Husel was under indictment. The damages sought by Husel in the malicious prosecution lawsuit are in case he does not recover the amount in the defamation case, Landy said.

“A malicious prosecution case says that a person complains to the authorities for the purpose of getting you arrested and indicted, as opposed to good faith belief that you’ve done something wrong,” Landy said. “It only works if the defendant is acquitted.”

Trinity Health said through a spokeswoman Thursday that the allegations in the lawsuit “are unfounded.”

“We will address the matter as appropriate through the legal process,” Trinity Health said in an email. “As this is an active lawsuit, we have no further comment.”",0
332,Are robot waiters the future? Some restaurants think so,"MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) — You may have already seen them in restaurants: waist-high machines that can greet guests, lead them to their tables, deliver food and drinks and ferry dirty dishes to the kitchen. Some have cat-like faces and even purr when you scratch their heads.

But are robot waiters the future? It’s a question the restaurant industry is increasingly trying to answer.

Many think robot waiters are the solution to the industry’s labor shortages. Sales of them have been growing rapidly in recent years, with tens of thousands now gliding through dining rooms worldwide.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that this is where the world is going,” said Dennis Reynolds, dean of the Hilton College of Global Hospitality Leadership at the University of Houston. The school’s restaurant began using a robot in December, and Reynolds says it has eased the workload for human staff and made service more efficient.

But others say robot waiters aren’t much more than a gimmick that have a long way to go before they can replace humans. They can’t take orders, and many restaurants have steps, outdoor patios and other physical challenges they can’t adapt to.

“Restaurants are pretty chaotic places, so it’s very hard to insert automation in a way that is really productive,” said Craig Le Clair, a vice president with the consulting company Forrester who studies automation.

Still, the robots are proliferating. Redwood City, California-based Bear Robotics introduced its Servi robot in 2021 and expects to have 10,000 deployed by the end of this year in 44 U. S. states and overseas. Shenzen, China-based Pudu Robotics, which was founded in 2016, has deployed more than 56,000 robots worldwide.

“Every restaurant chain is looking toward as much automation as possible,” said Phil Zheng of Richtech Robotics, an Austin-based maker of robot servers. “People are going to see these everywhere in the next year or two.”

Li Zhai was having trouble finding staff for Noodle Topia, his Madison Heights, Michigan, restaurant, in the summer of 2021, so he bought a BellaBot from Pudu Robotics. The robot was so successful he added two more; now, one robot leads diners to their seats while another delivers bowls of steaming noodles to tables. Employees pile dirty dishes onto a third robot to shuttle back to the kitchen.

Now, Zhai only needs three people to do the same volume of business that five or six people used to handle. And they save him money. A robot costs around $15,000, he said, but a person costs $5,000 to $6,000 per month.

Zhai said the robots give human servers more time to mingle with customers, which increases tips. And customers often post videos of the robots on social media that entice others to visit.

“Besides saving labor, the robots generate business,” he said.

Interactions with human servers can vary. Betzy Giron Reynosa, who works with a BellaBot at The Sushi Factory in West Melbourne, Florida, said the robot can be a pain.

“You can’t really tell it to move or anything,” she said. She has also had customers who don’t want to interact with it.

But overall the robot is a plus, she said. It saves her trips back and forth to the kitchen and gives her more time with customers.

Labor shortages accelerated the adoption of robots globally, Le Clair said. In the U. S., the restaurant industry employed 15 million people at the end of last year, but that was still 400,000 fewer than before the pandemic, according to the National Restaurant Association. In a recent survey, 62% of restaurant operators told the association they don’t have enough employees to meet customer demand.

Pandemic-era concerns about hygiene and adoption of new technology like QR code menus also laid the ground for robots, said Karthik Namasivayam, director of The School of Hospitality Business at Michigan State University’s Broad College of Business.

“Once an operator begins to understand and work with one technology, other technologies become less daunting and will be much more readily accepted as we go forward,” he said.

Namasivayam notes that public acceptance of robot servers is already high in Asia. Pizza Hut has robot servers in 1,000 restaurants in China, for example.

The U. S. was slower to adopt robots, but some chains are now testing them. Chick-fil-A is trying them at multiple U.S. locations, and says it’s found that the robots give human employees more time to refresh drinks, clear tables and greet guests.

Marcus Merritt was surprised to see a robot server at a Chick-fil-A in Atlanta recently. The robot didn’t seem to be replacing staff, he said; he counted 13 employees in the store, and workers told him the robot helps service move a little faster. He was delighted that the robot told him to have a great day, and expects he’ll see more robots when he goes out to eat.

“I think technology is part of our normal everyday now. Everybody has a cell phone, everybody uses some form of computer,” said Merritt, who owns a marketing business. “It’s a natural progression.”

But not all chains have had success with robots.

Chili’s introduced a robot server named Rita in 2020 and expanded the test to 61 U. S. restaurants before abruptly halting it last August. The chain found that Rita moved too slowly and got in the way of human servers. And 58% of guests surveyed said Rita didn’t improve their overall experience.

Haidilao, a hot pot chain in China, began using robots a year ago to deliver food to diners’ tables. But managers at several outlets said the robots haven’t proved as reliable or cost-effective as human servers.

Wang Long, the manager of a Beijing outlet, said his two robots have both have broken down.

“We only used them now and then,” Wang said. “It is a sort of concept thing and the machine can never replace humans.”

Eventually, Namasivayam expects that a certain percentage of restaurants — maybe 30% — will continue to have human servers and be considered more luxurious, while the rest will lean more heavily on robots in the kitchen and in dining rooms. Economics are on the side of robots, he said; the cost of human labor will continue to rise, but technology costs will fall.

But that’s not a future everyone wants to see. Saru Jayaraman, who advocates for higher pay for restaurant workers as president of One Fair Wage, said restaurants could easily solve their labor shortages if they just paid workers more.

“Humans don’t go to a full-service restaurant to be served by technology,” she said. “They go for the experience of themselves and the people they care about being served by a human.”",0
333,Peruvian politician convicted in 1988 murder of reporter,"LIMA, Peru (AP) — A Peruvian judge convicted retired army general and conservative politician Daniel Urresti and sentenced him to 12 years in prison Thursday for his role in the 1988 murder of a journalist who covered abuses during Peru’s civil war.

Hailed by advocates as an overdue but key verdict in upholding accountability and press freedom in Peru, the sentence represented a remarkable turnaround for Urresti, who has been an interior minister, congressman and presidential candidate as well as a frequent political commentator.

Urresti was a military intelligence officer in November 1988 when journalist Hugo Bustíos was machine-gunned and blown up with dynamite in a slaying initially blamed on the communist militant group Shining Path. A fellow journalist with Bustíos survived the attack.

Members of the military later were convicted of carrying out the ambush during a plainclothes patrol in Huanta province to prevent the journalist from covering news of military abuses against civilians in the largely Indigenous region. The man who had been the local military commander was convicted in the attack in 2007, and he implicated Urresti as a member of that patrol in 2011.

Judge Juan Santillán issued the sentence in Lima as Urresti listened along with his wife and daughter, whom he hugged before being taken into custody by the police. Prosecutors had requested 25 years, but said they were satisfied with the decision. Urresti indicated he would appeal.

Sharmelí Bustíos, daughter of the murdered journalist, told reporters that after 35 years, “I can tell my parents that they can finally rest in peace.”

The National Association of Journalists said in statements on social media that the verdict was restitution both for the family of Bustíos and for journalism. “It is an important step towards justice and the defense of press freedom in Peru,” the group said.

Urresti was a popular interior minister in 2014-15 under President Ollanta Humala, with a reputation for being outspoken and taking a hard line against crime. He served in Peru’s Congress in 2020-21 and was the presidential candidate in 2021 for the Podemos Perú party.

His conviction came only after a second trial. He initially was acquitted in a verdict that was annulled in 2019 by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial on the grounds the previous process was riddled with errors.

The Huanta province capital, also called Huanta, about 370 miles (600 kilometers) southeast of Lima, was one of the most violent cities during the war that raged between the Peruvian military and the Shining Path from 1980 to 2000.

Herminia Oré, who represents disappeared and tortured people of that city, told a journalist from The Associated Press in 2015 that there was an atmosphere of paranoia in Huanta during the conflict. “A candle lit in your house at night was a reason for the military to arrest you,” she said.

The civil war left an estimated 70,000 people dead, the majority of them in rural areas where the predominant languages were Quechua and Ashaninka.",0
334,Leaked documents may have origin in chatroom for gamers,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A major leak of classified U. S. documents that’s shaken Washington and exposed new details of its intelligence gathering may have started in a chatroom on a social media platform popular with gamers.

Held on the Discord platform, which hosts real-time voice, video and text chats, a discussion originally created to talk about a range of topics turned to the war in Ukraine. As part of debates about Ukraine, according to one member of the chat, an unidentified poster shared documents that were allegedly classified, first typing them out with the poster’s own thoughts, then, as of a few months ago, beginning to post images of papers with folds in them.

The posts appear to have gone unnoticed outside of the chat until a few weeks ago, when they began to circulate more widely on social media and get picked up by major news outlets. The leaks have alarmed U. S. officials and sparked a Justice Department investigation.

The records have provided startling and surprisingly timely details of U. S. and NATO assistance to Ukraine. They also provided clues about efforts to assist Ukraine in its war with Russia, including an anticipated spring offensive.

The scale of the exposure has yet to be determined. Also unclear is whether any government worked to share the documents or manipulate them.

Asked Monday if the U. S. government was effectively waiting for more intelligence documents to show up online, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby replied: “The truth and the honest answer to your question is: We don’t know. And is that a matter of concern to us? You’re darn right it is.”

Chris Meagher, top spokesman for the Pentagon, urged caution in “promoting or amplifying any of these documents,” adding that “it does appear that slides have been doctored.”

But the breach underscores the difficulties the U. S. and other governments face in securing classified information. Congressional reviews and experts have long warned of weaknesses in U.S. counterintelligence, of the challenges of monitoring an estimated 3 million people with security clearances, and of agencies producing and over-classifying so much information that the U.S. cannot reliably control it.

“I think that the intelligence agencies have adjusted and gotten better at preventing all sorts of mass electronic leaks,” said Kellen Dwyer, a former Justice Department prosecutor who was part of the team that brought a federal case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. “But clearly, they haven’t gotten good enough.”

The Associated Press interviewed a person who said he was a member of the Discord chat group in which documents appeared for several months. The person, who said he was 18 years old, refused to give his name, citing concerns for his personal safety.

The AP could not independently confirm many details shared by the person, and the original chatroom has been deleted.

The AP reviewed images of documents that appeared in recent weeks in the discussion forums. They include a top-secret analysis of deepening intelligence service ties between Russia’s FSB and agencies in the United Arab Emirates, the oil-rich Persian Gulf nation that hosts a U. S. air base and cooperates on many security matters with Washington.

Citing signals intelligence, the March analysis says officers from the FSB were caught claiming that the UAE had agreed with Russia “to work together against US and UK intelligence agencies.”

A spokesman for the Emirati government said the allegations “are categorically false.” U. S. officials at several agencies declined to comment on the document.

The AP also saw an analysis of what might happen in the Russia-Ukraine war in certain “wild card” scenarios, including if Russian President Vladimir Putin or Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were to die. The analysis is marked secret, a lower level of classification than top-secret.

Were Putin to fire his top military advisers and the war to escalate, the document speculates he might authorize the use of tactical nuclear weapons if “elites question Putin’s decision-making and Russian forces are unable to overcome manning and equipment shortfalls.”

The death of Zelenskyy, in a worst-case scenario, might prompt Europe to restrict weapons shipments, the document says. But a “high-profile Ukrainian leader” might also retain domestic and foreign support as well, it says.

The investigative journalism organization Bellingcat, which specializes in digging through social media and open-source records, interviewed the same person and two others in the Discord chatroom, called “Thug Shaker Central.”

Bellingcat reported Saturday that documents from Thug Shaker Central appear to have been shared in another chatroom, “WowMao.” From WowMao, the documents appear to have spread more widely — and eventually became the subject of a story in The New York Times on Thursday, which first reported that the Pentagon was investigating a breach.

The Discord user who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity says he was on a call with others — including the person who for months had been posting documents he or she said were classified — when the Times story broke.

“We all just kind of lost it,” the Discord user said. “We couldn’t believe what was happening.”

The person said his primary motivation for speaking to the media was to clear the reputation of a third person, who uses the screenname “Lucca.” Posts from Lucca featuring many of the documents were widely shared on Twitter and other social media. Those documents were reported on by The New York Times, The Washington Post and other media outlets.

Lucca “is just a kid,” said the poster who spoke to the AP. “He was just consistently posting it to mess with people.”

The poster declined to identify the person who originally uploaded the documents to Thug Shaker Central or confirm whether that person worked for the U. S. government. He referred to the original uploader with a nickname, “the O.G.”

But the poster said the person who first posted the documents did not appear to be driven by ideology or to expose government secrets broadly, but rather to impress people in their group.

Were that person to be arrested, the poster said he had copies of “way past hundreds” of pages of files.

He wanted to protect fellow posters in the now-defunct chat but also believed the documents contained secrets that Americans should know.

“On the off chance that the O. G. gets arrested, I’m leaking them all,” the poster said.

335,Gov't to start looking for bias in small business lending,"NEW YORK (AP) — Banks will need to start reporting the demographics and income of small business loan applicants under new rules published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday.

It’s a move that policymakers hope will lead to less discrimination and more transparency in the small business lending market, similar to how other laws have regulated the residential mortgage market for decades.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress mandated the bureau to start collecting data on small business lending decisions to look for patterns of discrimination. Implementation of the rule has taken more than a decade, and the bureau was sued by the California Reinvestment Coalition for its failure to start collecting this data.

Bank regulators have for decades collected data on residential mortgage applicants — including race, geography, whether the loan was approved and the interest rate — under a 1970s era law known as the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The data collected under HMDA has long been used by regulators and the public to look for potential signs of banks discriminating against borrowers, also known as redlining.

The size of the small business lending market is roughly $1.4 trillion, according to the CFPB. But there’s not much data on how banks and non-banks decide who to approve or deny for loans, and there’s no way of seeing — outside anecdotal reports — whether banks have discriminated against black and Latino small businesses.

“The impact of the rule will be in the comprehensive data that it produces, which can be used by lenders, borrowers, and the broader public to achieve better credit outcomes for small businesses and communities across the country,” said Rohit Chopra, director of the bureau, in a prepared statement.

Small business create roughly 60% of new jobs in the U. S., and the U.S. government puts billions of dollars of resources into supporting the creation of new businesses. During the pandemic, Congress gave $800 billion to small business through the Paycheck Protection Program to keep them operating.

While the bureau has issued its final rule on this issue, it make take a few years for the public to get access to the data. Banks will have to implement systems internally to start collecting the data, regulators will need systems to ingest it, and there will be a waiting period before the data is released.

Banks that originate at least 2,500 small business loans annually must start collecting the data in October 2024, with smaller banks having to collect the data in 2025 and 2026 depending on their size.",0
336,"Anderson makes 30 saves, leads Sabres to 4-3 OT win vs. Sens","BUFFALO, N. Y. (AP) — Casey Mittelstadt scored 1:18 into overtime and Craig Anderson stopped 30 shots before announcing he is retiring at the end of the season as the Buffalo Sabres closed their home schedule with a 4-3 win over the Ottawa Senators on Thursday night.

Tage Thompson scored his team-leading 47th goal, while Henri Jokiharju and Victor Olofsson also scored for Buffalo in a game between Atlantic Division rivals eliminated from playoff contention. By forcing overtime in rallying from a 3-2 deficit, the Sabres assured themselves of finishing 10th in the Eastern Conference standings.

Though extending their NHL-record playoff drought to 12 seasons following a 6-2 loss at New Jersey on Tuesday, the Sabres have 89 points to match their most since 2011-12, and with one game remaining. Buffalo’s 41 wins are also the most since winning 43 in 2010-11.

Claude Giroux achieved a single-season career-best by scoring his 35th goal, while playing in his 1,100th career game, and three days after reaching the 1,000-point plateau. Tim Stutzle had a goal and assist, and Dylan Gamrell also scored for the Senators, who closed their season with a 39-35-8 record.

Mittelstadt scored by accepting Rasmus Dahlin’s pass along the right boards, cutting into the circle and snapping a shot over Sogaard’s right shoulder.

The Sabres bench erupted with players racing down the ice to mob the 41-year-old Anderson in his crease. Senators players then waited near their bench to congratulate Anderson, who spent 10 season playing for Ottawa. The goalie then stood near the Senators bench and waved to the cheering crowd before once again being mobbed by his teammates with the crowd chanting “Andy! Andy! Andy!”

Anderson’s lengthy celebration ended with him hugging his two sons and wife at the Zamboni entrance.

The Sabres blew a 2-0 lead in allowing the Senators to score three straight times in the second period. Thompson tied the game at 3 by one-timing Jeff Skinner’s pass into the slot for a power-play goal 3:03 into the third period.

Anderson, who turns 42 next month, was trying to stay in the moment when asked before the game as to whether he might retire this summer. Anderson contemplated retirement last year before signing a one-year contract to return to Buffalo.

“Who knows. I’ve been very fortunate to play this game for a very long time. I’m just going to enjoy every last bit of it,” Anderson said. “The last few years have been on borrowed life support here.”

That all changed after the game. when he announced he will be retiring.

The Sabres had Anderson’s sons, Jake and Levi, announce Buffalo’s starting lineup in the locker room. The matchup was fitting because Anderson spent 10 seasons with the Senators, where he helped lead the team to the Eastern Conference finals in 2017.

Anderson, who now lives in south Florida and is from Park Ridge, Illinois, upped his career record to 319-275-71. He ranks fifth among American-born goalies in wins and games played, and third with 43 shutouts, one behind Ryan Miller.

Senators D Maxence Guenette, a seventh-round pick in the 2019 draft, made his NHL debut. ... Sabres D Mattias Samuelsson is missing the final two games with an injury that has nagged him for much of the past month.

337,"Cannes sets slate with Wes Anderson, Todd Haynes, the Weeknd","New films by Wes Anderson, Alice Rohrwacher, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Todd Haynes and Wim Wenders will compete for the Cannes Film Festival’s coveted top honor, the Palme d’Or, as will a record number of films directed by women.

Cannes artistic director Thierry Frémaux and president Iris Knobloch, who took over the post last year from Pierre Lescure, announced a lineup heavy on big-name international auteurs, along with some new faces, in a press conference Thursday in Paris.

Among the 19 films selected for Cannes’ prestigious competition slate are Anderson’s sci-fi homage “Asteroid City,” Wenders’ “Perfect Days”; Kor-eda’s “Monster”; Alice Rohrwacher’s “La Chimera”; and Haynes’ “May December,” a romance with Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore. Ken Loach, long a Cannes regular, will return with “The Old Oak.” Jonathan Glazer will premiere his first feature since 2013′s “Under the Skin” with his Martin Amis adaptation “Zone of Interest.”

After a scaled-down 2021 event and a comeback festival in 2022, this year’s Cannes finds the festival back on level ground and its organizers triumphant that their mission — celebrating the best in world cinema as an inherently theatrical experience — has persevered.

“The films are back in theaters and the public is back in theaters,” said Knobloch. “The moviemakers, the artists, the professionals are all in agreement. Nothing can replace the cultural event represented by a release in a theater for a movie.”

Joining Rohrwacher, the Italian director of “Happy as Lazzaro,” in competition are five more female directors: France’s Catherine Breillat with “Last Summer”; Austria’s Jessica Hausner with “Club Zero”; France’s Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall”; Senegalese-French director Ramata-Toulaye Sy with “Banel & Adama”; and Tunisia’s Kaouther Ben Hania with the documentary “Olfa’s Daughters.”

Cannes has often come under criticism for selecting few films by women for its prestigious competition lineup. Only two female filmmakers have ever won the Palme d’Or: Jane Campion in 1993 for “The Piano” and Julia Ducournau in 2021 for “Titane.” While six out of 19 films is a new high, it still falls below the parity that some have sought.

Several of Cannes’ splashiest premieres had already been announced. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will debut in Cannes, along with a special tribute to Harrison Ford, as will Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” his big-budget adaptation for Apple of David Grann’s non-fiction bestseller. Fremaux said he urged Scorsese to screen “Killers of the Flower Moon” in competition at the festival, but it isn’t currently scheduled to compete for the Palme.

On Tuesday, Cannes said that the Pedro Almodóvar short “Strange Way of Life,” with Pedro Pascal and Ethan Hawke, will also premiere at the festival.

Cannes gets underway May 16 with the opening-night selection “Jeanne du Barry,” starring Johnny Depp as King Louis XV. The film, directed by and co-starring the French actress and filmmaker Maïwenn, has been billed as Depp’s comeback film following his explosive trial last year with Amber Heard, his ex-wife. The festival runs through May 27.

The much-anticipated HBO series “The Idol”, from “Euphoria” creator Sam Levinson and starring the Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp, will also debut in Cannes. Steve McQueen, the director of “12 Years a Slave” and the film anthology “Small Axe,” will present his “Occupied City,” a documentary about Amsterdam under Nazi occupation during World War II.

The jury that will decide the Palme d’Or will this year be led by the Swedish filmmaker Ruben Östlund, a two-time Palme winner. After winning Cannes top honor for 2017’s “The Square,” Östlund won last year for the social satire “Triangle of Sadness.”

Cannes is coming off a movie year that has reinforced the French festival’s position as arguably the premiere international launching pad for film. Three of this year’s best-picture nominees at the Oscars premiered in Cannes: “Top Gun: Maverick,” “Elvis” and “Triangle of Sadness.”",0
338,N. Korea fires missile that may have been new type of weapon,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Thursday conducted its first intercontinental ballistic missile launch in a month, possibly testing a new more mobile, harder-to-detect missile for the first time, its neighbors said, as it extends its provocative run of weapons tests.

Japan briefly urged residents on a northern island to take shelter in an indication of its vigilance over North Korea’s evolving missile threats.

U. N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the launch and reiterated his calls on North Korea to comply with U.N. resolutions banning such launches, reopen communications channels and resume dialogue toward peace and denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, his spokesman said.

The missile was launched on a high angle from near the North Korean capital of Pyongyang and fell in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan following a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) flight, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staffs said in a statement.

It described its range as medium or longer. The U. S. National Security Council called it a long-range missile and Japan’s government said it likely had an intercontinental range.

South Korea’s military believes North Korea launched a new type of ballistic missile, possibly using solid fuel, a defense official said under the condition of anonymity because of office rules.

If the launch involved a solid-fuel ICBM, it would be the North’s first test of such a weapon. North Korea’s known ICBMs all use liquid propellants that must be fueled before launches. But the fuel in a solid-propellant weapon is already loaded, allowing it to be moved easier and fired faster.

A solid-fuel ICBM is one of the key high-tech weapons that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to build to better cope with what he calls U. S. military threats. He also wants a multiwarhead missile, a nuclear-powered submarine, a hypersonic missile and a spy satellite.

Kim Dong-yub, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the launch may have involved a new intermediate- or long-range missile powered by solid propellants, or be linked to North Korean preparation to launch a spy satellite.

U. S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the latest launch “needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region.” Watson said the United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and South Korean and Japanese allies.

During an emergency meeting of Seoul’s National Security Council, officials stressed the need to tighten three-way security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida held a meeting of his NSC to analyze the launch and Japan’s response.

The nuclear envoys of Seoul, Washington and Tokyo held a telephone conversation where they called for a “decisive and united international response” to North Korean provocations and stronger efforts to stem illicit North Korean funding of its weapons program.

North Korea commonly test-launches missiles toward the international waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, using elevated trajectories to avoid neighboring countries. South Korea and Japan typically don’t issue evacuation orders unless they determine the North Korean weapon is flying in their direction.

Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada told reporters the North Korean missile launched Thursday did not reach Japan’s exclusive economic zone. But Japanese authorities still urged people on the northernmost island of Hokkaido to seek shelter and temporarily suspended train, bus and subway services there. Local communities also activated alert sirens through community speakers, urging people to evacuate.

The government then retracted its missile alert, saying there was no possibility of the missile landing near Hokkaido. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters the alert was based on the Japanese Defense Ministry’s early assessment of the missile’s path and was an “appropriate” step to prioritize people’s safety.

Japanese authorities issued a similar evacuation order in October when a North Korean intermediate-range missile flew over Japan in a launch that demonstrated the weapon’s potential to reach the U. S. Pacific territory of Guam.

Thursday’s launch was the North’s first long-range missile firing since the country tested its longest-range, liquid-fueled Hwasong-17 ICBM on March 16. Kim Jong Un reviewed his country’s attack plans Monday and vowed to enhance his nuclear arsenal in more “practical and offensive” ways.

North Korea has launched about 100 missiles since the start of 2022, many of them nuclear-capable weapons that place the U. S. mainland, South Korea or Japan within striking distance.

The North’s testing spree is largely in protest of South Korean-U. S. military drills that it views as a rehearsal for an invasion. Some observers say North Korea uses its rivals’ drills as a pretext to modernize its weapons arsenal and pressure Washington and Seoul to make concessions such as the lifting of economic sanctions. South Korean and U.S. officials say their drills are defensive in nature and were arranged to respond to North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats.

Later Thursday, China, North Korea’s last major ally, reiterated its blame for the heightened animosities on the U. S. and South Korea.

“The negative impact of the U. S. military exercises and strategic weapons deployed around the peninsula a few days ago is obvious to all,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing.

North Korea unveiled a new type of nuclear warhead in late March, raising concerns it could conduct its first nuclear test in more than five years. Foreign experts debate whether North Korea has developed warheads small and light enough to fit on its more advanced missiles.

South Korean officials say North Korea has not been responding to South Korean calls on a set of cross-border inter-Korean hotlines for about a week. Communications on those channels are meant to prevent accidental clashes along the rivals’ disputed western sea boundary.

On Tuesday, South Korean Unification Minister Kwon Youngse expressed “strong regret” over what he called North Korea’s “unilateral and irresponsible attitude” over the hotlines.

North Korea’s advancing nuclear arsenal is expected to be a major topic during a summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and U. S. President Joe Biden later this month in Washington.

Experts say the discussions between world leaders at Japan’s Group of Seven meetings in May could be crucial for maintaining diplomatic pressure on North Korea. U. N. Security Council permanent members China and Russia have blocked tighter sanctions on North Korea in recent months, underscoring a divide deepened by Russia’s war on Ukraine.",0
339,"In new book, Murakami explores walled city and shadows","TOKYO (AP) — Haruki Murakami wrote a story of a walled city when he was fresh off his debut. More than four decades later, as a seasoned and acclaimed novelist, he gave it a new life as “The City and Its Uncertain Walls.”

It was three years ago when he felt the time had come to revisit the story that he thought was imperfect but had important elements, such as the wall and the shadow, and tackle them again based on what he was feeling on his skin.

“Because of the coronavirus … I hardly went out and stayed home most of the time, and I tended to look at my inner self. Then I thought, perhaps it’s time to write that story,” Murakami said. And he did, “as if recovering it from the back of a drawer.”

He started writing it in January 2020 and finished in December 2022, years that overlapped with multiple earthshattering events. “When I write a novel, I just know it’s time,” he said.

There were also Russia’s war on Ukraine, shaken globalism and the Pandora’s box of social media, Murakami noted.

“In an age when society is going through rattling changes, whether to stay holed up inside the wall or to go to the other side of the wall has become a greater proposition than ever,” Murakami said in an interview ahead of the book release in Tokyo with selected journalists including The Associated Press.

“The City and Its Uncertain Walls” was released Thursday in print and in digital formats by Shinchosha Publishing Co. The availability of an English translation is not yet known. It’s his first novel since the 2017 bestseller, “Killing Commendatore.”

Murakami wasn’t in Japan when the book was released. He has been holding seminars about female protagonists in his stories at Wellesley College, the women’s school in Massachusetts once attended by former U. S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and late Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Initially, Murakami’s intention was to rewrite the 1980 story “The City, and Its Uncertain Walls” to improve it. But the story didn’t end there, and Murakami kept writing. The version published in the “Bungakukai” literary magazine was rewritten, then became the first chapter of what turned into a three-part, 672-page novel.

In Part 2, the protagonist gets a job as head of a library in a small town in Fukushima, where he meets his mysterious predecessor and a teenage boy as the story leads up to the final section.

Dozens of enthusiasts of Murakami novels celebrated the release of his new book outside a landmark bookstore in downtown Tokyo at a midnight countdown event Wednesday, and many who didn’t make it showed up for a special early morning sale Thursday.

“I’m so excited,” said Kaori Otoh, a longtime fan of Murakami’s work, as she gently held her new purchase. “I have to fight my temptation of reading the book at work.” Kotaro Watanabe, 32, said he planned to read all night at a café with his friends. He has read the two previous stories of the walled city and said: “I really look forward to finding out how this story ends differently.”

Going to the other side of the wall requires determination, belief and physical strength, Murakami says. “You have to squeeze out all your might, or you can’t go to the other side of the world.”

His stories are “by no means pessimistic,” he says. “Despite many bizarre things and a dark side, my stories are fundamentally positive,” he said. “I think stories must be positive.”

In some of his earlier stories, protagonists travel between two worlds, through a wall, a well or a cave.

“I think that sliding through a wall, a process that involves going to the other side of the world and coming back from there, is an extremely important step,” Murakami said.

There are many kinds of walls — between conscious and unconscious, real and unreal, and the physical walls that separate societies, like what used to stand in Berlin and the barriers between Israel and the Palestinian territories, he said.

He kept thinking about the meaning of the wall in this story while writing it, Murakami said. Walls can carry different meanings and purpose, depending on who are inside, he said.

Equally important to Murakami and his stories is the shadow. He says the shadow is a form of his subconscious, or an alter ego, which resembles his negative side and helps him to know himself.

“Writing a novel, for me, is to dig down to that depth,” he said. The distinction between the main body and the shadow becomes blurry in the book, which broadened its scope of the story. He said it was a difficult process and he had to rewrite many times.

“I’m now in my mid-70s, and I don’t know how many more novels I can write. So I strongly felt that I must write this story with affection, and spend ample time to do so,” he said.

Murakami, who debuted with a 1979 story “Hear the Wind Sing,” says the original version of his new novel contained the key elements of the wall and the shadow but it also had potential that was too complex for a second-year novelist to handle.

It then evolved as part of “Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,” a 1985 bestseller of two intertwined stories of pop and action-filled science fiction and an imaginary world of a secluded walled city of the dead.

Looking back, Murakami said even that attempt was premature. He shelved a rewriting attempt for another 35 years, though the story stayed on his mind, “like a tiny fishbone stuck in the throat,” he said.

Murakami said he started feeling confident about his storytelling ability in midcareer, around 2000, just before he wrote “Kafka on the Shore,” the bestselling novel released in 2002. “From there I have come thus far, I thought perhaps now I can finally rewrite the incomplete work of ’The City and Its Uncertain Walls.’”

Twice as old now at age 74, Murakami says he is more intrigued by the tranquility as in the “End of the World” part of the 1985 novel than the pop and action depicted in the “Hard-Boiled Wonderland” side of that novel.

“You can’t help it, and I think it’s only natural,” he says, but he never tires of balancing writing novels, translating his favorite Western literature and in recent years hosting his own radio show. “I really enjoy writing. It’s fun to write, and rewriting is more fun.”

The driving force for his multiformat operation, he says, is running. It’s his daily morning routine and he has run 40 marathons. “Translation, running, and collecting used records,” he said, citing his hobbies. “I don’t have time for a night life, which might have been a good thing.”",0
340,New Hampshire Senate rejects lifting abortion ban penalties,"CONCORD, N. H. (AP) — The penalties associated with New Hampshire’s 24-week abortion ban will remain in place after the state Senate on Thursday killed legislation that would have removed them.

The Republican-led Senate voted 14-10 along party lines to reject a bill that would have removed the civil and criminal penalties from the 2021 ban on abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy. It also rejected adding an explicit right to abortion up to 24 weeks to state law. Both bills had passed the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 201-196 majority.

Democrats unsuccessfully argued that the state should codify abortion rights in the wake of the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision last year overturning Roe v. Wade and ending the nationwide right to abortion.

“Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, this Legislature has not taken one single, proactive affirmative step to protect access to abortion,” said Democratic state Sen. Becky Whitley, of Hopkinton. “We have not taken one single step to reassure women that we do not intend to further restrict their fundamental rights. Words spoken on this floor are important, but they are not law. They are not enough. Granite Staters want action.”

Republicans insisted that the existing law is sufficient.

“I really think that our law is crystal clear,” said Republican state Sen. Sharon Carson, of Londonderry. “A woman can safely get an abortion here in New Hampshire up to 24 weeks. This is not needed.”

The votes came a day after a federal appeals court in Texas issued a ruling that at least temporarily preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone but reduced the period of pregnancy when it can be used and said it could not be dispensed by mail. The Justice Department said it would ask the Supreme Court for an emergency order to put any action on hold.

While that court fight plays out, lawmakers in states dominated by Democrats are seeking to protect access and Republicans are trying to tighten restrictions. New Hampshire lawmakers are considering more than half a dozen bills on both sides of the issue, but with the closely divided Legislature, none have been enacted.

On Thursday, state Senate Democrats argued that the penalties associated with New Hampshire’s ban — up to seven years in prison and fines up to $100,000 — have made it more difficult to attract health care providers to the state at a time when hospitals are struggling with staffing shortages.

“Leaving these criminal penalties in place will send a message to the providers here, and especially those considering moving here, that we as a state believe that a decision that should be fundamentally between a woman and their doctor could potentially be a criminal one,” said Democratic state Sen. Donna Soucy, of Manchester.

But Republicans countered that having no penalty would make the law unenforceable, and that there was no evidence that the penalties have scared doctors away.

“I think what we should do is see what the data is in a couple of years, and then we can really make an informed decision,” said Republican state Sen. Daryl Abbas, of Salem.

The House rejected multiple bills last month to further restrict abortion access while also killing a proposal that would have asked voters to weigh in on adding “reproductive autonomy” to the state constitution.

Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who considers himself an abortion rights supporter but also signed the current abortion ban into law as part of the state budget, supported both of the bills that failed in the state Senate Thursday.",0
341,Minnesota moose population drops but holds relatively stable,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota’s moose population has dropped in the past year but wildlife managers say it remains relatively stable overall.

The annual estimate by the Department of Natural Resources, released Thursday, put the state’s moose population 3,290. Although that’s down from 2022’s estimate of 4,700 which was the most in a decade, the DNR said the population has been relatively stable since 2013.

After a decline from approximately 8,000 in 2009, the DNR said Minnesota’s moose population appears to have stabilized at about 3,700 animals in recent years.

Stabilized doesn’t mean the population holds constant, said John Giudice, DNR wildlife biometrician. Instead, annual changes since 2013 appear to be relatively small on average and random, with some years showing an increase and others a decrease.

The DNR bases its moose estimates on winter aerial surveys. Factors such as visibility of moose from the air, bad weather and moose avoidance of aircraft create moderately high sampling uncertainty, which makes it difficult for researchers to make confident statements about the magnitude of annual population changes unless those changes are relatively large.

The 2023 survey results showed that calves comprised an estimated 16% of the population and the estimated calf-cow ratio was 38 calves per 100 cows. Those estimates are slightly lower than last year’s figures but are comparable to values observed during the last 10 years. Both factors are key indicators of reproductive success.",0
342,"Point gets 50th, 51st goals, Lightning beat Red Wings 5-0","TAMPA, Fla (AP) — Brayden Point scored his 50th and 51st goals, backup Brian Elliott made 32 saves and the Tampa Bay Lightning stopped a four-game losing streak with a 5-0 win over the Detroit Red Wings in the regular-season finale for both teams on Thursday night.

Point joined Steven Stamkos (2009-10, 2011-12) and Vincent Lecavalier (2006-07) as the only Lightning players to reach the 50-goal mark. The playoff-bound Lightning will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in a first-round series starting next week.

Point collected the rebound of Nikita Kucherov’s power-play shot in the slot, made a move around goalie Ville Husso and put it into the net with 9:13 left in the third for his 50th. The center added an empty-netter at 15:59.

The 38-year old Elliott, a free agent after the season, picked up his second shutout of the season and 45th overall. He had allowed six goals in each of his previous three starts.

Alex Killorn, Brandon Hagel and Michael Eyssimont also scored for the playoff-bound Lightning.

Tampa Bay rested defensemen Victor Hedman and Erik Cernak in advance of the playoffs. Goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy served as the backup.

The Red Wings, despite ending the season 0-4-1, finished with their most points (80) since their last playoff team had 93 in 2015-16.

Detroit’s Dylan Larkin was pointless and wound up with 79 points, one short of becoming the first Red Wings player with 80 since Henrik Zetterberg in 2010-11.

Killorn made it 1-0 at 7:49 of the first with his career-high 27th goal on Tampa Bay’s first shot. The Lightning didn’t get another shot until the period’s final 23 seconds from Anthony Cirelli and Point.

Elliott turned aside all 12 first-period shots he faced.

Hagel got his 30th goal 7:27 into the third.

Elliott had a nifty glove stop on Jake Walman during a 40-second stretch in the second.

Elliott is 50th on the career list with 279 wins. He tied Marty Turco and Jimmy Howard for his 66th place in goalie games played with 543.

Tampa Bay forwards Nick Paul (26 games), Corey Perry (25), and Cirelli (13) all have lengthy goal droughts. Perry is tied with Jason Arnott for 93rd on the NHL career goals list with 417.",0
343,"After shootings, man threatened California Capitol","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — A man suspected of making “credible threats” against California’s Capitol after shooting a gun from his vehicle and lodging bullets in the wall of a hospital and commercial building in the suburbs of Sacramento was arrested Thursday afternoon, authorities said.

The Roseville Police Department said the man will be booked into county jail on charges of attempted homicide, assault with a firearm, shooting from a moving vehicle and shooting at an inhabited dwelling. The police department and the California Highway Patrol, which was investigating the threats to the Capitol, named 30-year-old Jackson Pinney, 30, as the suspect. It wasn’t clear if Pinney had an attorney to speak on his behalf.

No one was injured in the shootings, authorities said.

CHP did not immediately comment on the arrest and have not detailed the substance of the threat against the Capitol.

The threat forced California’s Assembly to cancel its Thursday session. Senators evacuated to work in a new location. The Capitol remained open much of the morning, allowing people to gather on the outdoor grounds and take tours inside the historic building, but for part of the afternoon a sign on the door said the building was temporarily closed to the public.

The two prior shootings were in Roseville and Citrus Heights, two cities northeast of Sacramento.

Police in Roseville and Citrus Heights said they responded late Wednesday to reports of someone shooting a gun from a vehicle while driving through the cities. Bullets struck two buildings in Citrus Heights and a hospital in Roseville, police said.

The two departments and the CHP said they believed both shootings and the threat to the Capitol involved Pinney.

State senators and their staff members were notified about the threat involving the building in an email Thursday morning from Senate Secretary Erika Contreras.

“The California Highway Patrol (CHP) has notified the Senate of a threat they consider to be credible involving the Capitol,” Contreras wrote. “The CHP and security partners are present in higher numbers in the Capitol area, and are alert of the situation.”

Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon and Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins said in a joint statement that they relocated the Senate and ended the Assembly session early “out of an abundance of caution.”

“We apologize for the adjustments and interruptions to the members of the public who planned to come to the Capitol today to make their voices heard,” they said. “In this situation, we must put everyone’s safety and security first. We encourage everyone to stay alert and stay safe.”

Staffers were told to “remain situationally aware and report any suspicious activity,” said a memo from Assembly Chief Administrative Officer Lia Lopez.

The Capitol building was not placed on official lockdown, said John Casey, a spokesperson for Rendon.",0
344,"Drug mix of xylazine, fentanyl","The U. S. has named a veterinary tranquilizer as an “emerging threat” when it’s mixed with the powerful opioid fentanyl, clearing the way for more efforts to stop the spread of xylazine.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy announced the designation Wednesday, the first time the office has used it since the category for fast-growing drug dangers was created in 2019.

Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the drug policy office, said xylazine (pronounced ZAI’-luh-zeen) has become increasingly common in all regions of the country.

It was detected in about 800 drug deaths in the U. S. in 2020, most of them in the Northeast. By 2021, it was present in more than 3,000 fatalities — with the most in the South — according to a report last year from the Drug Enforcement Administration.

“We cannot ignore what we’re seeing,” Gupta said. “We must act and act now.”

Xylazine was approved for veterinary use in 1971. Sometimes known as “tranq,” it has been showing up in supplies of illicit drugs used by humans in major quantities in only the last several years.

It is believed to be added to other drugs to increase profits. Officials are trying to understand how much of it is diverted from veterinary uses and how much is made illicitly.

The drug causes breathing and heart rates to slow down, sometimes to deadly levels, and causes skin abscesses and ulcers that can require amputation. Withdrawal is also painful.

While it is often used in conjunction with opioids, including fentanyl and related illicit lab-made drugs, it’s not an opioid. And there are no known antidotes.

Gupta said his office is requesting $11 million as part of its budget to develop a strategy to tackle the drug’s spread. Plans include developing an antidote, learning more about how it is introduced into illicit drug supplies so that can be disrupted, and looking into whether Congress should classify it as a controlled substance.

Gupta said it needs to be available for veterinary uses even amid crackdowns on the supply used by people. He also said systems to detect the drug and data about where it’s being used need to be improved.

The Drug Policy Alliance, a group that advocates for reducing the harm done by drugs, applauds parts of the Biden administration’s plan, including looking for antidotes to reverse overdoses and developing quick tests to determine whether xylazine is present. But the group is wary of trying to stop it through law enforcement action. It asserts that crackdowns on prescription opioids and heroin created the condition for fentanyl and now xylazine to overtake some drug markets.

“Focusing on supply-side interdiction will only dig us deeper into this crisis and inevitably result in more loss of life,” Maritza Perez Medina, director of the group’s office of federal affairs, said in a statement.

The drug is part of an overdose crisis plaguing the U. S.

The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 107,000 people died from overdoses in the 12 months that ended Nov. 30, 2022. Before 2020, the number of overdose deaths had never topped 100,000.

Most of the deaths were linked to fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Like xylazine, they are often added to other drugs — and users don’t always know they are getting them.

This story was initially published on April 12. It was updated on April 13 to correct that the Drug Policy Alliance advocates for reducing the harm done by drugs.",0
345,Posthumous Kenny Rogers album will feature unreleased songs,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Previously unreleased songs recorded by the late country superstar Kenny Rogers will be on a new record coming out in June.

After a career spanning jazz, rock, country and pop, the Grammy-winning balladeer nicknamed “The Gambler” died at the age of 81 in 2020. His widow, Wanda Rogers, curated the posthumous record called “Life is Like a Song,” coming out June 2 on UMe.

The recordings were made between 2008 and 2011 and includes originals and covers like Eric Clapton’s “Wonderful Tonight” and “At Last,” made famous by Etta James, which will be on a deluxe version of the record. The album will also include two previously released songs, his duet with Dolly Parton, “Tell Me That You Love Me,” and “Goodbye,” written by Lionel Richie, both released in 2009, but never digitally.

The Country Music Hall of Famer had a thriving career for some 60 years with such hits as “Lucille,” “Lady” and “Islands in the Stream,” a beloved Parton-Rogers duet.

“He would often say that he wanted his songs to be ‘what every man wants to say, and every woman wants to hear,’” Wanda Rogers said in a press release. “I think there are a lot of those moments on this album. This is a very special record to me and our family because it really tells the story of our life together, and I feel his fans will also relate to it in a big way because it walks the listener through the seasons of life that we all experience in one way or another.”",0
346,Hawaii surfer recalls costly shark attack,"HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii surfer Mike Morita woke up early and planned to get a few waves in before going to Easter service with his wife.

Morita, 58, headed to his regular spot locals call Kewalos, known for reliable waves over shallow reef near the mouth of a harbor not far from downtown Honolulu on the island of Oahu’s south shore.

“The water was crystal clear,” he said, noting how it was already bright at 6:15 a.m.

He was lying on his stomach on his board after riding a few waves when he felt a bite on his right leg.

“The sheer strength of it, I knew right away it was a shark,” he said Wednesday from his hospital bed. “In that critical moment, I went to God.”

He prayed for the shark to free his leg as the pressure intensified and the creature thrashed about.

“I kind of surprised myself that I went straight into prayer,” he recalled.

But he didn’t pray to stay alive: “The whole time, I never thought I was gonna die.”

“God wanted me to fight, so I started beefing,” he said, using a Hawaii Pidgin term for fighting. He repeatedly punched and swore at the shark.

His shouts and swearing got the attention of his fellow Kewalos regulars, who paddled straight toward him without hesitation.

“The water was red — with my blood,” he said. “I cannot believe how much courage my friends had.”

The friends later told Morita the shark dragged him underwater. Morita remembers slipping an arm around the shark, sort of like a hug. He reached for its gills.

“As I went by the gills, it let go,” he said.

State officials said it was reported to be an 8-foot (2.4-meter) tiger shark.

Morita’s surf buddies used their board leashes to make a tourniquet and helped him onto a longboard that carried him back to shore. At one point, he looked back and saw only bone from ankle to knee on his right leg. Paramedics later told him without the tourniquet, he would have bled to death, Morita said.

Doctors amputated Morita’s right foot, and he was scheduled to undergo another surgery Thursday.

“My prayer now is they won’t have to amputate above the knee,” he said.

Morita, who started surfing in the fourth grade, believes he’ll surf again. “I’m not good at it, but I love it,” he said.

It’s a hobby he enjoyed on days off from his job as a United Airlines ramp service worker.

Morita said his faith in God, which has grown in recent years, has kept him from getting depressed.

“I would be mad at God, mad at the world, mad at the shark,” he said. “I can honestly say I am at peace. I have no fear of the ocean right now.”

He joked that he should have gone to New Hope Oahu’s 7 a.m. Sunday church service instead of planning to go to the one at 9:15 a.m.

“Unfortunately I never made it to the service,” he said.",0
347,Cisco still faces caste bias suit; engineers' case dismissed,"The California Civil Rights Department has voluntarily dismissed its case alleging caste discrimination against two Cisco engineers, while still keeping alive its litigation against the Silicon Valley tech giant.

The two Cisco supervisors, Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella, were accused in the department’s lawsuit of discriminating and harassing an employee on the basis of caste – a division of people based on birth or descent. That case was dismissed by an order of the Santa Clara Superior County Court last week. The employee belonged to the Dalit community, a group that is at the bottom rung of the caste system which took root and evolved in India and elsewhere in the subcontinent.

The Civil Rights Department sent a statement to The Associated Press on Monday saying the case against Cisco “remains ongoing.”

“We will continue to vigorously litigate the matter on behalf of the people of California,” it said, adding that it remains committed to “securing relief and ensuring company wide, corrective action.”

California’s lawsuit against Cisco, filed in July 2020, alleges that the Dalit engineer received less pay and fewer opportunities and that the defendants retaliated against him when he opposed “unlawful practices, contrary to the traditional order between the Dalit and higher castes.” The engineer worked on a team at Cisco’s San Jose headquarters with Indians who all immigrated to the U. S. as adults, and all of whom were of high caste, the lawsuit stated.

The caste system in India and other South Asian countries, as well as the diaspora, places Dalits at the bottom of a social hierarchy. In 1948, a year after independence from British rule, India banned discrimination on the basis of caste, a law that became enshrined in the nation’s constitution in 1950.

The lawsuit against Cisco and its engineers fueled a movement against caste discrimination led by groups such as Oakland, California-based Equality Labs. This lawsuit has also been named in groundbreaking actions including the first-in-the-nation ordinance passed by the Seattle City Council in February to include caste in its anti-discrimination laws. Last month, California State Sen. Aisha Wahab proposed a bill, which if it passes, could make the state the first in the nation to outlaw caste-based bias.

The South Asian community has been sharply divided on this issue. Some groups such as Hindus for Human Rights and Hindus for Caste Equity say such a safeguard is necessary to protect vulnerable community members from caste-based discrimination in housing education and the tech sector where many hold key roles. Advocates and other groups say caste discrimination is pervasive in several South Asian communities and the diaspora, across religious lines.

However, other organizations such as the Hindu American Foundation and the Coalition of Hindus of North America oppose such policies arguing that they will specifically target Hindus and Indian Americans who are commonly associated with the caste system. These groups also maintain that there is no clear data to show that such discrimination exists, and that caste is covered under “national origin” making it unnecessary to carve out a separate protected category.

The Civil Rights Department voluntarily dismissing its case against the two engineers is a vindication for activists who have held the position that “the state has no right to attribute wrongdoing to Hindu and Indian Americans simply because of their religion or ethnicity,” said Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation.

“Two Indian Americans endured a nearly three year nightmare of unending investigations, a brutal online witch hunt and a presumption of guilt in the media,” she said.

Thenmozhi Soundararajan, founder and executive director of Equality Labs, a Dalit-led advocacy group, said last week’s action “does not change anything” including the fact that the Cisco case “has given so many Dalits the courage to come forward with their stories about caste discrimination in education, the medical and tech industries.”

“This is not a loss, but progress,” she said. “The Dalit community owes (the engineer) and the Civil Rights Department gratitude for having the courage to bring such a historic case forward.”

A mediation conference between Cisco and the California Civil Rights Department has been set for May 2.

348,"Mo'Nique sues CBS, Paramount over 'Parkers' royalties","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mo’Nique sued Paramount and CBS on Wednesday, seeking what the Oscar-winning actor and comedian says are unpaid royalties from her sitcom “The Parkers.”

The breach-of-contract lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by The Associated Press alleges the defendants artificially depressed the show’s profitability to “retain millions that would otherwise be contractually due” to Mo’Nique’s production company.

“While the Series has proven to be a major financial success for its producers and distributors, the series’ talent have not been permitted to share in the fruits of that success,” the suit says.

The suit was filed by Hicks Media, the production company Mo’Nique owns with her husband and business partner, Sidney Hicks. It names as defendants CBS Studios, Paramount Pictures and the show’s production company Big Ticket Productions. It seeks monetary damages to be determined at trial.

Emails seeking comment were sent to representatives of the defendants.

The suit says the series’ creators and writers have been similarly underpaid, and that Mo’Nique learned of the alleged breach of contract when they recently filed a similar lawsuit.

“I just want the contractual compensation that I’ve earned,” Mo’Nique said in a statement.

“The Parkers,” a spinoff of the sitcom “Moesha,” ran for five seasons and 110 episodes on the now-defunct network UPN, a forerunner of The CW, from 1999 to 2004. Mo’Nique starred as Nikki Parker, a mother who returns to the same college her daughter is attending.

The show has been rerun in syndication in various forms since, and has been available for streaming on Netflix since 2020.

In a previous lawsuit, Mo’Nique sued Netflix for race and sex discrimination in its offer for a proposed comedy special, accusing the streaming service of giving her a lowball offer that was part of a larger company tendency to underpay black women. The suit was settled last year.

“Mo’Nique is not shy about taking on these David vs. Goliath battles in Hollywood to challenge these questionable practices that are endemic to the industry,” David deRubertis, one of her attorneys in both lawsuits, said in a statement.

The 55-year-old actor, whose legal name is Monique Angela Hicks, first gained fame as a stand-up comic and was among the “Queens of Comedy” featured in the 2000 film of the same name. She won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her performance in the 2009 movie “Precious.”",0
349,Hurricanes beat Panthers 6-4 to win Metropolitan Division,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Brent Burns scored twice and the Carolina Hurricanes scored four times in the third period to beat the Florida Panthers 6-4 on Thursday night to win the Metropolitan Division.

Jesperi Kotkaniemi, Jesper Fast, Shayne Gostisbehere and Sebastian Aho also scored for the Hurricanes, who began the night one point ahead of New Jersey atop the division. Frederick Andersen finished with 31 saves.

Carolina will open the first-round of the Stanley Cup playoffs against the New York Islanders.

Aleksander Barkov, Ryan Lomberg, Anthony Duclair and Carter Verhaege scored for Florida, which began the night one point behind the Islnders for the top wild card in the Eastern Conference. Alex Lyon had 30 saves.

The Panthers will face league-best Boston in the first round of the playoffs.

Florida, which had scored two early goals in the third to tie the score and came within a goal in the final 90 seconds, ended up falling short of earning the top wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference and will now open the playoffs against the top-seeded Boston Bruins.

The Panthers came into the night on a seven-game point streak (6-0-1) but found themselves down 2-0 going into the third period.

Burns opened the scoring 8:21 into the first period with a long shot from inside the blue line before Kotkaniemi gave Carolina a 2-0 lead 1:12 into the second.

The Panthers came out fast in the third period, with Barkov scoring at 1:14 with Lomberg tying things at 2 just over two minutes later.

The Hurricanes quickly took their two-goal lead back as Burns scored at 6:07 with Fast putting a rebound past Lyon at 6:28.

After an empty net goal from Gostishere with 2:40 remaining, the Panthers scored a pair of quick goals (again, with the net empty) as Duclair got his second of the season and Verhaege recorded his 42nd.

With a minute left, however, Aho put the finishing touches with Carolina’s second empty-net goal of the night.

The Panthers signed two of their top prospects this week. C Mackie Samoskevich, their first-round selection in 2021, left the University of Michigan after his sophomore season and joined Florida’s AHL team in Charlotte. D Mike Benning, the MVP of the 2022 Frozen Four with the University of Denver, signed his entry-level contract and joined the Panthers on Thursday. Benning took part in Florida’s morning skate but did not play against the Hurricanes.

350,Man pleads not guilty in anti-abortion office firebombing,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The man accused of firebombing a prominent Wisconsin anti-abortion group’s office has pleaded not guilty.

Investigators believe Hridindu Roychowdhury, of Madison, threw two Molotov cocktails into the Madison office of Wisconsin Family Action last May. He entered a not guilty plea Tuesday to one count of attempting to cause damage by means of fire or an explosive. He also waived his right to appear in court for an arraignment once he is returned to Wisconsin.

One of the firebombs thrown into the anti-abortion group’s office failed to ignite; the other set a bookcase on fire. No one was in the office at the time. The message “If abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either” was found spray-painted on the building.

Police arrested Roychowdhury in a Boston airport last month after investigators matched his DNA to samples from the crime scene. He had a one-way ticket to Guatemala, according to the U. S. attorney’s office.

Myra Longfield, a spokesperson for the U. S. attorney’s office in Madison, said Thursday that Roychowdhury is being held in federal custody but has not yet been returned to Wisconsin. A date has not been set for his initial appearance in court.",0
351,Abortion pill rulings in conflict,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will be the next stop for a legal fight over a drug used in the nation’s most common abortion method.

A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the abortion pill mifepristone can still be used for now but reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be taken and said it could not be dispensed by mail. The Biden administration said Thursday it will appeal.

The decision temporarily narrowed a ruling by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the drug while a lawsuit over it plays out.

Mifepristone was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration more than two decades ago. It has been used by more than 5 million women to safely end their pregnancies and today more than half of women who end a pregnancy rely on the drug, the Justice Department said.

In a separate suit brought by liberal states, a judge in Washington state ordered the FDA not to do anything that might affect the availability of mifepristone in the suing states.

A look at what has happened so far, the conflicting rulings and how the legal fight might play out:

The Texas suit over mifepristone was filed in Amarillo late last year. Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, represents the pill’s opponents, who say the FDA’s approval of mifepristone was flawed. Erin Morrow Hawley, the wife of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is one of the lead lawyers in the case.

Why Amarillo? U. S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, is the sole district court judge there, ensuring that all cases filed in the West Texas city land in front of him. Since taking the bench, he has ruled against the Biden administration on several other issues, including immigration and LGBTQ protections.

In March, Kacsmaryk held a hearing in the case that lasted more than four hours and was notable in part because Kacsmaryk sought to delay publicizing that it would happen to avoid protests. His ruling came approximately three weeks later.

The Washington state ruling was issued by Spokane-based Judge Thomas O. Rice, whom President Barack Obama nominated.

The Biden administration had asked the New Orleans-based 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals to prevent Kacsmaryk’s ruling from taking effect for now.

Late Wednesday, the appeals court narrowed Kacsmaryk’s ruling so that the initial approval of mifepristone in 2000 is not affected, for now. But it agreed with him that changes the FDA made to relax the rules for prescribing and dispensing the drug should be put on hold. Those included expanding when the drug could be taken, from seven weeks to 10 weeks of pregnancy. The FDA also had allowed for telehealth visits to prescribe mifepristone and for the drug’s delivery through the mail.

The appeals court acted by a 2-1 vote. The judges in the majority, Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham, are both Trump picks. The third judge, Catharina Haynes, was nominated by President George W. Bush. She said she would have put the lower court ruling on hold entirely for now to allow oral arguments in the case.

The Biden administration also has asked the court in Washington state to clarify its order, which the Justice Department had noted was is in “significant tension” with the initial Texas ruling. It’s unclear how, now that the appeals court has ruled, the two cases interact and impact the drug’s use. The government had asked for clarity by Friday, but that was before the appeals court ruled.

Neither side got everything it wanted from the appeals court.

Alliance Defending Freedom, representing anti-abortion doctors and medical groups, said in a call with the media early Thursday it didn’t plan to ask the Supreme Court to intervene at this point. The Biden administration said it would.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that the administration “strongly disagrees” with the appeals court decision.

“We will be seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to defend the FDA’s scientific judgment and protect Americans’ access to safe and effective reproductive care,” he said.

It’s unclear how the case might fare at the Supreme Court.

Conservative justices last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case, and said states should decide whether to allow abortions within their borders. But if they hoped that their decision would remove abortion from their docket, the fight over the abortion pill shows that it’s not gone.

This time, though, while the case is about an abortion pill, the issues that the court will confront in ruling on access to the drug while the suit goes through appeals are about the rules that govern federal regulations and technicalities in the law: Did FDA take the right steps before approving the use of mifepristone and easing restrictions on its use? Do the anti-abortion groups and doctors who are suing the FDA have the legal right, or standing, to be in court? Did too much time elapse since the approval of mifepristone in 2000?

After the Supreme Court gets asked to weigh in, there is no timetable for when it might act.

The administration’s appeal of Kacsmaryk’s ruling will continue in the appeals court, regardless of whether all or part of his ruling takes effect in the meantime.",0
352,Ex-Colombia rebel urges armed groups to support government,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Addressing the U. N. Security Council for the first time, a former Colombian rebel leader who now heads a political party urged the country’s remaining armed groups Thursday to recognize left-wing President Gustavo Petro’s government as “democratic and progressive” and stop fighting against it.

Rodrigo Londoño accused Petro’s right-wing predecessor, Ivan Duque, of failing to implement the 2016 peace agreement with his rebel group, the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia known as the FARC. That accord was aimed at ending more than 50 years of war in Colombia that caused over 220,000 deaths and displaced nearly 6 million people.

But Londoño told the council in a video briefing that Petro’s electoral victory in 2022 brought in a progressive government committed to “political and social transformations,” including comprehensively implementing the peace agreement.

“We trust his word and we hope that his decisive action” will move implementation forward, he said.

Londoño, who told ambassadors he joined the FARC as a 16-year-old in 1976 and was its last commander who signed the 2016 peace deal, said dissident FARC members who took up arms after the government failed to occupy regions abandoned by rebels after they laid down their weapons represent “a miniscule percentage of those who first signed the agreement.”

He said his party supports talks between Petro’s government and the left-wing National Liberation Army rebel group known as the ELN plus the remaining dissident groups. The government and ELN both hailed progress at the end of a second round of peace talks last month in Mexico City.

Urging the armed groups not to fight against Petro’s progressive efforts and his “total peace policy,” Londoño said a cease-fire should be something “that these organizations should embrace.”

He criticized the Duque government for distributing just 251,122 hectares of the 3 million hectares of land to be put in a land fund under the peace agreement for distribution to poor people in rural areas who most needed it, and failing to significantly reduce rural poverty. He also faulted Duque’s government for failing to provide adequate security for former FARC members as well as adequate education and health care.

Londoño, who was the target of an assassination attempt, said Petro faces huge challenges in implementing the peace agreement “especially in the face of certain sectors and parties from the previous government who are intent on preventing even minimal transformations in favor of the people.”

If it wasn’t for support from the international community, especially the United Nations and the Security Council which authorized a mission to monitor implementation of the peace agreement at the request of the Colombian government, he said “the attempt to find a political solution with us would have failed.”

Londoño said his supporters were participating in the Security Council meeting Thursday “with great hope” that it will strongly support Petro’s aim of fully implementing the 2016 peace agreement which “will have a multiplying effect.”

The U. N. special envoy for Colombia, Carlos Ruiz Massieu, told the council he was “honored” to be in Londoño’s presence, saying “his leadership in the transition from war to peace has been and will continue to be fundamental.”

“His participation today is certainly testimony of the commitment of thousands of former combatants to the final peace agreement,” he said.

Ruiz also pointed to a recent meeting between president Petro and Londoño in Bogota and their joint visit to a former area for training and reintegration of former combatants “in the wake of a serious threat by an illegal armed group against dozens of former combatants.”

In recent days, he said, the government has established an office headed by a high-level official in the presidency to look after the comprehensive implementation of the 2016 agreement – another example of its commitment.

Ruiz welcomed the government’s negotiations with the ELN and another group of ex-FARC fighters, and urged “all illegal armed actors not to waste the opportunity presented by the bold pursuit of peace through dialogue.”

Colombia’s Foreign Minister Alvaro Leyva, who said he met Londoño 30 years ago as a combatant, called the council meeting “truly a miracle,” saying the former FARC leader not only helped draft and sign the peace agreement but is now a member of a political party promoting its implementation.

The minister said it was especially meaningful for him to be at the Security Council “after several years where there was an attempt to put a brake on the agreement for national reconciliation signed between the Colombian state and the FARC.”

Leyva said Petro is not only trying to implement “total peace” within Colombia but also beyond its borders and it is hosting a conference in Bogota on April 25 with countries from Latin America, Europe, the United States and Canada “to see how we could resume the political dialogues.”",0
353,Experts link graves to one of nation's oldest Black churches,"Three men whose graves were found at the original site of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches were members of its congregation in the early 19th century, a team of archaeologists and scientists in Virginia announced Thursday.

The First Baptist Church was formed in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, Virginia’s colonial capital. Members initially gathered in fields and under trees in defiance of laws that prevented African Americans from congregating.

The church’s original brick foundation was uncovered in 2021 by archaeologists at Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that now owns the land. The excavation of graves began last year in partnership with First Baptist’s descendant community.

More than 60 burial plots have been identified. Thursday’s announcement confirmed what oral histories had long told — that previous generations were buried on the land before it was paved over in the 20th century.

“Now we know they’re ours — they’re ours,” church member Connie Matthews Harshaw said Thursday. “Those people under that soil are of African descent. We go from there.”

Three sets of remains were chosen for examination. They underwent DNA testing, bone analysis and the evaluation of archaeological evidence that was found, including 19th century coffin nails. The wood from the hexagonal coffins is long gone.

Only one set of remains could provide adequate DNA, which can indicate race, said Raquel Fleskes, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Connecticut who conducted the analysis.

Those remains belonged to a Black man between the ages of 16 and 18 who stood 5 feet, 4 inches tall. His grave contained a clothing button that was made from animal bone and still carried some cotton fiber, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s director of archaeology.

The young man’s grave appeared to be marked by an upside-down, empty wine bottle. His coffin was likely moved from a previous location based on the large number of nails — possibly used to reinforce the coffin — and the jumbled way his bones came to rest.

The young man’s teeth indicated some kind of stress, which could have been malnutrition or disease, said Joseph Jones, a research associate with William & Mary’s Institute for Historical Biology.

Michael Blakey, the institute’s director, added that few African Americans in Williamsburg were free at the time.

“It either represents the conditions of an enslaved childhood or far less likely — but possibly — conditions for a free African American in childhood,” Blakey said.

The two other sets of remains belonged to men between the ages of 35 to 45 and possibly older, based on the analyses of their bones and teeth.

One of them stood 5 feet, 8 inches and was possibly the oldest of the three. His remains were found with a copper straight pin that likely bound clothing or a funeral shroud.

The other man stood 5 feet, 7 inches and was buried in a vest and trousers. His leg bones indicated the repetitive use of certain muscles, suggesting the heavy labor of someone who was enslaved.

The graves in Williamsburg are among Black burial grounds and cemeteries that are scattered throughout the nation and tell the story of the country’s deep past of slavery and segregation. Many Black Americans were excluded from white-owned cemeteries and built their own burial spaces, often as a form of resistance.

Descendants are working to preserve these grounds and cemeteries, many of which are at risk of being lost and lack support.

“All over the country there has been reckless disregard for African American bodies,” said Harshaw, of First Baptist.

“We are now becoming an example to the rest of the country,” she said. “We’re getting interest from everywhere, with people saying, ‘Wait a minute, how do you guys do this?’”

The church’s original meeting house was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. First Baptist’s second structure, built in 1856, stood there for a century.

But an expanding Colonial Williamsburg museum bought the property in 1956 and turned it into a parking lot.

The museum tells the story of Virginia’s late 1700s capital through colonial-era buildings and interpreters. But it failed to tell First Baptist’s story.

Founded in 1926, the museum did not tell Black stories until 1979, even though more than half of the people who lived in the colonial capital were Black, and many were enslaved.

In recent years, Colonial Williamsburg has boosted its efforts to tell a more complete story, placing a growing emphasis on African-American history.

The museum plans to recreate First Baptist’s original meeting house on the land where it once stood, said Gary, the museum’s director of archaeology.

“A big part of that is to commemorate the space where the burials are located,” he said.",0
354,Biden admin celebrates new bridges as campaign season nears,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is awarding nearly $300 million to help repair or replace more than a dozen bridges across the country, closing out a three-week tour to highlight the benefits of infrastructure investments in local communities.

Events in four states on Thursday marked the end of the beginning phase of an increasingly expansive White House effort to remind voters of his President Joe Biden’s accomplishments heading into his expected 2024 reelection race.

During the administration’s “Investing in America” tour, Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials held more than 50 events across 25 states at projects benefiting from the landmark infrastructure, climate and high-tech manufacturing laws passed during the Democratic president’s first two years in office.

There will be much more talk to come about Biden’s record.

“This is the focus of the next year-plus,” White House chief of staff Jeff Zients, who got the job in February with a mandate to oversee implementation of the massive laws, told The Associated Press. “The priority is implementation, execution and communicating with the American people how this is making people’s lives better.”

On Thursday, Harris attended an event awarding $72 million to rebuild a major bridge carrying I-395 from Virginia into Washington. Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was in upstate New York to announce $21 million to rehabilitate the Castleton-on-Hudson Bridge, Federal Highway Administrator Shailen Bhatt announced $51.2 million to replace six bridges in rural South Carolina, and White House infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu celebrated $15.1 million to help replace six bridges leading into Madison, Wisconsin.

“We think about things like the Golden Gate Bridge,” Harris said, standing in front of the simple concrete span into the nation’s capital, but bridges like the one crossing the Potomac River are “just as important.”

Zients said the officials’ travel is part of the White House emphasis on “telling the story” of Biden’s record, adding that “the best way to tell the story is to go where things are happening.”

While such stories are generally overshadowed on a national scale by other developments, the White House believes the officials’ visits and the milestones they mark will resonate with the communities that benefit from them. As projects go from the drawing board to shovels in the ground to ribbon-cuttings, Zients said, the administration is planning to be there to celebrate each step, “local community by local community.”

The sales pitch to Americans comes as the prospects for new legislation of similar impact are minimal. Republicans with no desire to help Biden now control the House, and Congress appears headed for a summer of discord over raising the nation’s debt limit and keeping the government open.

Zients said one aim of the White House push was to draw a contrast with congressional Republicans, many of whom have voted against key pieces of Biden’s legislative record. It’s a strategy Biden deployed effectively in the 2022 midterms, when Democrats saw a better-than-expected outcome.

“When people understand the choices they face, President Biden’s vision and approach and his results speak for themselves — and we win,” Zients said.

Biden, 80, has not formally launched his 2024 bid, but he has said he intends to run — and has cleared the Democratic field of significant challengers. An announcement is expected in the coming months.",0
355,Second expelled Black Democrat reinstated to Tennessee House,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The second of two Black Democrats who were kicked out of the Republican-led Tennessee House followed his colleague back to work at the Capitol on Thursday, a week after their expulsion for participating in a gun control protest propelled them into the national spotlight.

State Rep. Justin Pearson, of Memphis, was sworn in Thursday outside the Statehouse. The day before, Shelby County commissioners unanimously voted to reinstate him.

“Yes indeed, happy resurrection day,” Pearson said as he signed paperwork for his return.

“There will be a new building of this building, with a foundation built on love,” Pearson said during a fiery speech outside the Capitol after being sworn in. “With pillars of justice rising up. With rafters of courage covering us. With doors that are open to everybody in the state of Tennessee. Not just rich somebodies, but everybody. Not just straight somebodies, but everybody. Not just Republican somebodies, but everybody.”

After delivering his speech to supporters and reporters outside the Capitol, Pearson walked into the House chamber as debate on bills was underway. He pumped his fists and silently mouthed, “This is our House.” Those in the gallery pumped their fists back and mouthed “Our House” as Pearson circled around the floor.

Before Pearson returned to the chamber, lawmakers cheered and applauded as the police officers who responded to the deadly March 27 mass shooting at a Nashville elementary school shooting — the event that prompted the gun control protest — were honored in the chamber. Democratic state Rep. Bob Freeman praised the officers’ bravery but also stressed to his fellow lawmakers that “inaction is not an option” on how to respond to the tragedy.

Republicans banished Pearson and state Rep. Justin Jones last week over their role in the protest on the House floor over the shooting, which left three children and three adults dead.

In his address outside the Capitol, Pearson read the names of those killed and referenced another mass shooting on Monday at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, in which five people were killed and eight others were injured.

“Our law enforcement, which many people praise, are being forced to go to war when they just are going to work,” Pearson said. “Kids are told to go to fortresses, instead of to go to school and places of learning. We’re told to go to church, carrying the status quo’s thoughts and prayers, while we must be in fear that somebody will walk in with an assault weapon.”

Upon Pearson’s return to the House floor, lawmakers debated legislation that deals with the teaching of “divisive concepts” regarding race, gender and sex on college campuses. After a brief spirited debate involving Pearson and Jones, Republicans used procedural rules to immediately halt discussion and force members to vote on the bill. The move exasperated Democrats, who immediately pointed out that cutting off debate and silencing dissenters was what led the so-called Tennessee three to break House rules after being cut off from previous debates.

The Nashville Metropolitan Council took only a few minutes Monday to restore Jones to office. He was quickly reinstated to his House seat that day.

The appointments are interim, though both Jones and Pearson plan to run in special elections for the seats later this year.

The House’s vote to remove Pearson and Jones but keep white state Rep. Gloria Johnson drew accusations of racism. Johnson survived by one vote. Republican leadership denied that race was a factor, noting that Johnson’s role in the protest didn’t involve some steps that Jones and Pearson took, including speaking into a bullhorn.

Banishment is a move the chamber has used only a handful times since the Civil War. Most state legislatures have the power to expel members, but it is generally reserved as a punishment for lawmakers accused of serious misconduct, not used as a weapon against political opponents.

The expulsions last Thursday made Tennessee a new front in the battle for the future of American democracy. In the span of a few days, the two raised thousands of campaign dollars and the Tennessee Democratic Party received a new jolt of support from across the U. S.

Political tensions rose when Pearson, Johnson and Jones, from the House floor, joined with hundreds of demonstrators who packed the Capitol to call for passage of gun control measures.

As protesters filled the galleries, the lawmakers approached the front of the House chamber with a bullhorn and participated in a chant. The scene unfolded days after the shooting at the Covenant School, a private Christian school. Their participation from the front of the chamber broke House rules because the three did not have permission from the House speaker.

In Tennessee, Republican lawmakers have been supportive of the idea to strengthen school safety, but they have largely rejected calls for stricter gun controls with only weeks to go in the legislative session.

The shooting and aftermath have pushed some, including Republican Gov. Bill Lee, to support some changes.

Lee has since called on the General Assembly to pass legislation aimed at keeping dangerous people from acquiring weapons. It’s unclear how successful he will be at drumming up support from lawmakers within his party at the tail end of the legislative session.

Lee, meanwhile, has avoided commenting on the lawmakers’ expulsions, saying the controversy is a House issue.",0
356,"Home-based workers became younger, more diverse in pandemic","People working from home became younger, more diverse, better educated and more likely to move during the worst part of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to survey data from the U. S. Census Bureau.

In many respects, the demographic makeup of people working from home from 2019 to 2021 became more like workers who were commuting, while the share of the U. S. labor force working from home went from 5.7% in 2019 to 17.9% in 2021, as restrictions were implemented to help slow the spread of the virus, according to a report released last week based on American Community Survey data.

“The increase in homebased workers corresponded with a decline in drivers, carpoolers, transit riders, and most other types of commuters,” the report said.

The share of people working from home between ages 25 and 34 jumped from 16% to 23% from 2019 to 2021. The share of home-based workers who are Black went from 7.8% to 9.5%, and it went from 5.7% to 9.6% for Asian workers. It remained flat for Hispanic workers, the report said.

The share of home-based workers with a college degree also jumped from just over half to more than two-thirds, and people working from home were more likely to have moved in the past year than commuters.

The two industry groups that saw the greatest jumps in people working from home were in information, where it went from 10.4% to 42%, and finance, insurance and real estate, going from 10.8% to 38.4%. Professional and administrative services, also went from 12.6% to 36.5%.

The smallest gains were in agriculture and mining; entertainment and food services; and armed forces.

While every income level saw jumps in people working from home, those in the highest income bracket were most likely to work from home. While it doubled from 2019 to 2021 for workers in the lowest income bracket, it tripled for those in the highest, the report said.

Home-based work also varied by region. By 2021, it was more prevalent in the West and Northeast, making up about a fifth of the workforce, compared to 16.2% in the South and 15.8% in the Midwest. The variation may have been caused by the availability of Internet access, the cluster of information technology jobs on the coasts and the way people commute, whether by car or public transportation, the report said.

The tech-heavy San Francisco and San Jose metro areas had more than a third of their labor force working from home in 2021 — the largest share among metros with more than 1 million residents.

Since most pandemic restrictions have been lifted since the 2021 survey was taken, it is unknown at this point if the growth in work-from-home is permanent.

“If only temporarily, the COVID-19 pandemic generated a massive shift in the way people in the United States related to their workplace location,” the report said. “With the centrality of work and commuting in American life, the widespread adoption of home-based work was a defining feature of the pandemic era.”",0
357,4 Penobscot Indians accuse Maine priests of sexual abuse,"BANGOR, Maine (AP) — Four Native Americans who say they were abused by three Roman Catholic priests on their reservation in Maine are the latest to bring lawsuits since the state fully lifted the statute of limitations for child sex crimes.

The Penobscot Nation members contend the abuse started when they were 7 to 16 years old at St. Ann Parish on Indian Island, just north of Bangor. The oldest abuse dates to 1972, while the most recent happened in 1987, according to the lawsuits.

Michael Bigos, a lawyer representing the members, filed the lawsuits in Penobscot County Superior Court, despite potential legal roadblocks by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland. More than two dozen lawsuits brought by Bigos’ law firm are currently on hold while the diocese challenges the 2021 law that repealed the statute of limitations.

“Let us find out what the diocese knew and when they knew it, so they can be held fully accountable, and we can keep our communities safe for survivors,” Bigos told reporters in Bangor.

The diocese didn’t respond to an email requesting comment.

One of the priests identified in a lawsuit, the Rev. Marcel Robitaille, was previously accused by others of sexual abuse and sentenced to a life of prayer and penance by the Vatican. Robitaille has since died. The other two priests named in the lawsuits, the Revs. David Cote and Leo James Michaud, are believed to be alive and living in Maine, Bigos said.

Reached at his home, Cote said he was surprised to learn that he was targeted in a lawsuit. “I don’t see myself as abusing anybody,” the 79-year-old told The Associated Press. The AP was unable to reach Michaud.",0
358,Boeing Max production could be slowed by issue with parts,"Boeing said Thursday that production and delivery of a “significant number” of its 737 Max planes could be delayed because of questions about a supplier’s work on the fuselages.

Boeing said the supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, used a “non-standard manufacturing process” during installation of fittings near the rear of some 737s. Aircraft parts must be produced and installed to meet exacting federal standards.

The company said the situation is not an immediate safety issue and planes already flying “can continue operating safely.” But, Boeing said, it notified the Federal Aviation Administration about the matter and is working to inspect planes and replace fittings when necessary.

The FAA said that “based on the facts and data Boeing presented, the FAA validated the company’s assessment that there is no immediate safety issue.”

The parts issue is the latest setback for Boeing. All Max planes were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after a pair of deadly crashes, and production flaws halted deliveries of the larger 787 jetliner several times in the past three years.

Spirit provides fuselages for all Max jets, but it is not the only supplier for the fittings. For that reason, production of one model, the Max-9, is not affected by the current situation.

Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, said it “identified a quality issue” on the rear section of some Max fuselages and told Boeing.

“We have processes in place to address these of types of production issues upon identification, which we are following,” the company said.

A Boeing spokeswoman said Thursday that the company could not say exactly how many planes are affected because the issue was just discovered.

Shares of Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing fell more than 5% and Spirit tumbled about 7% in after-hours trading.",0

360,Navy veteran who stormed Capitol gets 3 years on gun charges,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A former Navy reservist who stormed the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler was sentenced Thursday to three years in prison on firearms charges.

The sentence U. S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff imposed for Hatchet Speed in federal court in Alexandria was just five months less than the term sought by federal prosecutors and much longer than the one-year term sought by Speed’s lawyers.

Speed, 41, of McLean, is a military veteran who held top-secret clearances while working for a defense contractor.

The gun charges against him in Virginia are separate from charges brought in Washington, D. C., for obstructing an official proceeding, the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying the Electoral College vote. He will sentenced on those charges next month; sentencing guidelines in that case call for a term of nearly five to six years.

Speed’s lawyers asked the judge not to be prejudiced against him because of his inflammatory views. In conversations with an FBI undercover employee in 2022, Speed expressed admiration not only for Hitler but also for Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

In recorded conversations, Speed also made antisemitic comments and proposed targeting Jewish people with acts of violence. He also collected neo-Nazi memorabilia.

But Nachmanoff said Speed’s admiration for despicable historical figures and his views on advocating violence to achieve his objectives demonstrate the danger he poses to the public.

“The defendant’s statements of admiration for Adolf Hitler, Eric Rudolph and Ted Kaczynski ... and his belief that such activities could be justified are all highly relevant,” Nachmanoff said.

Prosecutors said Speed, a member of the far-right Proud Boys group, believed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump. After Joe Biden took office, Speed began making preparations for what he believed was imminent civil war and started stockpiling weapons, including the three silencers that were the subject of his Virginia trial.

In Thursday’s closing statements, prosecutor Thomas Traxler said Speed studied the manifestos of Rudolph and Kaczynski to try to “come up with a better game plan than they had.”

Speed had claimed he was innocent because the devices he purchased were actually “solvent traps” used to collect excess fluid when you clean a gun.

The devices are indeed marketed as solvent traps, but their design is similar to that of a silencer. The only significant difference is that the “solvent traps” require drilling a hole in the end to turn them into functioning silencers.

Speed bought the devices, which are made of titanium and sell for hundreds of dollars, after he tried to buy silencers and faced significant delays. Speed said he did not believe he was required to register the devices as silencers with the government unless he drilled holes in them — something he never did.

Prosecutors, though, said the law governing silencers covers devices intended for use as a silencer, regardless of whether they are functional or sold under another name.

Speed’s first trial in Virginia ended with a hung jury and a mistrial, as jurors apparently struggled with the legal definition of a silencer and whether Speed was required to register them. He was convicted at a retrial, after one of the initial jurors reached out to prosecutors and explained what caused the jury’s confusion.

Traxler said the legal loophole that Speed thought he uncovered was “too cute by half” and urged a stiff sentence to discourage others from doing likewise.

Speed, who intends to appeal his conviction, did not speak at Thursday’s hearing.",0
361,Mexico's immigration chief called to court over deadly fire,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican prosecutors said Thursday the head of the country’s immigration agency is to make an initial appearance in court next week as part of their investigation of a fire at a detention center last month that killed 40 migrants.

National Immigration Institute chief Francisco Garduño is scheduled to appear April 21, the Attorney General’s Office said in a statement. At that point prosecutors will make their formal accusations and present evidence, the statement said.

Prosecutors had announced late Tuesday that Garduño would face unspecified criminal charges in the case.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has known Garduño for years and asked him to take the job in 2019 when then U. S. President Donald Trump was pressuring Mexico to reduce migration, said Wednesday that Garduño would stay in his job.

Federal prosecutors has said Garduño was remiss in not preventing the disaster in Ciudad Juarez despite earlier indications of problems at his agency’s detention centers. Prosecutors said government audits had found “a pattern of irresponsibility and repeated omissions” in the immigation institute.

The March 27 fire in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, allegedly started when a migrant set fire to a mattress in protest in a cell holding dozens of people. Smoke quickly filled the facility and no one let the migrants out.

Three Mexican immigration officials, a guard and a Venezuelan migrant accused of starting the blaze are already in custody facing homicide charges.

Prosecutors said Thursday that another unidentified official was scheduled to give a statement and that arrest orders had been issued for other immigration officials.",0
362,Italy's Berlusconi continues to improve in ICU,"ROME (AP) — Doctors caring for former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi reported a further “constant improvement” in his condition Thursday as he receives treatment for a lung infection and apparent kidney problems caused by chronic leukemia.

The 86-year-old remained in intensive care at Milan’s San Raffaele clinic, where he was admitted April 5 with breathing problems.

After his hospitalization, Berlusconi’s longtime physician, Dr. Alberto Zangrillo, revealed the former three-time premier had been dealing with chronic leukemia for some time and was being treated for a related lung infection.

Zangrillo and oncologist Dr. Fabio Circeri reported Thursday that Berlusconi experienced “a further constant improvement in the respiratory and renal functioning” over the previous 72 hours.

The treatment had helped to contain inflammation and a high number of white blood cells, the doctors said. An elevated white blood cell count indicates an infection, and leukemia typically causes an overproduction of abnormal cells.

The influential Vatican-appointed Latin Patriarch, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, told The Associated Press that the region’s 2,000-year-old Christian community has come under increasing attack, with the most right-wing government in Israel’s history emboldening extremists who have harassed clergy and vandalized religious property at a quickening pace.

The uptick in anti-Christian incidents comes as the Israeli settler movement, galvanized by its allies in government, appears to have seized the moment to expand its enterprise in the contested capital.

“The frequency of these attacks, the aggressions, has become something new,” Pizzaballa said during Easter week from his office, tucked in the limestone passageways of the Old City’s Christian Quarter. “These people feel they are protected … that the cultural and political atmosphere now can justify, or tolerate, actions against Christians.”

Pizzaballa’s concerns appear to undercut Israel’s stated commitment to freedom of worship, enshrined in the declaration that marked its founding 75 years ago. The Israeli government stressed it prioritizes religious freedom and relations with the churches, which have powerful links abroad.

“Israel’s commitment to freedom of religion has been important to us forever,” said Tania Berg-Rafaeli, the director of the world religions department at the Israeli Foreign Ministry. “It’s the case for all religions and all minorities that have free access to holy sites.”

But Christians say they feel authorities don’t protect their sites from targeted attacks. And tensions have surged after an Israeli police raid on the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque compound set off outrage among Muslims, and a regional confrontation last week.

For Christians, Jerusalem is where Jesus was crucified and resurrected. For Jews, it’s the ancient capital, home to two biblical Jewish temples. For Muslims, it’s where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven.

The scorn heaped upon minority Christians is nothing new in the teeming Old City, a crucible of tension that the Israeli government annexed in 1967. Many Christians feel squeezed between Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Palestinians.

But now Netanyahu’s far-right government includes settler leaders in key roles — such as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who holds criminal convictions from 2007 for incitement of anti-Arab racism and support for a Jewish militant group.

Their influence has empowered Israeli settlers seeking to entrench Jewish control of the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, alarming church leaders who see such efforts — including government plans to create a national park on the Mount of Olives — as a threat to the Christian presence in the holy city. Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their hoped-for state.

“The right-wing elements are out to Judaize the Old City and the other lands, and we feel nothing is holding them back now,” said Father Don Binder, a pastor at St. George’s Anglican Cathedral in Jerusalem. “Churches have been the major stumbling block.”

The roughly 15,000 Christians in Jerusalem today, the majority of them Palestinians, were once 27,000 — before hardships that followed the 1967 Mideast war spurred many in the traditionally prosperous group to emigrate.

Now, 2023 is shaping up to be the worst year for Christians in a decade, according to Yusef Daher from the Inter-Church Center, a group that coordinates between the denominations.

Physical assaults and harassment of clergy often go unreported, the center said. It has documented at least seven serious cases of vandalism of church properties from January to mid-March — a sharp increase from six anti-Christian cases recorded in all of 2022. Church leaders blame Israeli extremists for most of the incidents, and say they fear an even greater surge.

“This escalation will bring more and more violence,” Pizzaballa said. “It will create a situation that will be very difficult to correct.”

In March, a pair of Israelis burst into the basilica beside the Garden of Gethsemane, where the Virgin Mary is said to have been buried. They pounced on a priest with a metal rod before being arrested.

In February, a religious American Jew yanked a 10-foot rendering of Christ from its pedestal and smashed it onto the floor, striking its face with a hammer a dozen times at the Church of the Flagellation on the Via Dolorosa, along which it’s believed Jesus hauled his cross toward his crucifixion. “No idols in the holy city of Jerusalem!” he yelled.

Armenians found hateful graffiti on the walls of their convent. Priests of all denominations say they’ve been stalked, spat on and beaten during their walks to church. In January, religious Jews knocked over and vandalized 30 graves marked with stone crosses at a historic Christian cemetery in the city. Two teenagers were arrested and charged with causing damage and insulting religion.

But Christians allege that Israeli police haven’t taken most attacks seriously. In one case, 25-year-old George Kahkejian said he was the one beaten, arrested and detained for 17 hours after a mob of Jewish settlers scaled his Armenian Christian convent to tear down its flag earlier this year. The police had no immediate comment.

“We see that most incidents in our quarter have gone unpunished,” complained Father Aghan Gogchian, chancellor of the Armenian Patriarchate. He expressed disappointment with how authorities frequently insist cases of desecration and harassment hinge not on religious hatred but on mental illness.

The Israeli police said they have “thoroughly investigated (incidents) regardless of background or religion” and made “speedy arrests.” The Jerusalem municipality is boosting security at upcoming Orthodox Easter processions and creating a new police department to handle religiously motivated threats, said Jerusalem deputy mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum.

Most top Israeli officials have stayed quiet on the vandalism, while government moves — including the introduction of a law criminalizing Christian proselytizing and the promotion of plans to turn the Mount of Olives into a national park — have stoked outrage in the Holy Land and beyond.

Netanyahu vowed to block the bill from moving forward, following pressure from outraged evangelical Christians in the United States. Among the strongest backers of Israel, evangelicals view a Jewish state as the fulfillment of a biblical prophecy.

Meanwhile Jerusalem officials confirmed that they’re pressing on with the contentious zoning plan for the Mount of Olives — a holy pilgrimage site with some dozen historic churches. Christian leaders fear the park could stem their growth and encroach on their lands. Jewish settlements home to over 200,000 Israelis already encircle the Old City.

The Israeli National Parks Authority promised buy-in from churches and said it hopes the park will “preserve valuable areas as open areas.”

Pizzaballa pushed back. “It’s a kind of confiscation,” he said.

Simmering tensions in the community came to a head over Orthodox Easter rituals as Israeli police announced strict quotas on the thousands of pilgrims seeking to attend the rite of the “Holy Fire” at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

Citing safety concerns over lit torches being thrust through massive crowds in the church, authorities capped Saturday’s ceremony at 1,800 people. Priests who saw police open gates wide for Jews celebrating Passover, which coincided this year with Easter, alleged religious discrimination on Wednesday.

These days, Bishop Sani Ibrahim Azar of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jerusalem said he struggles for answers when his congregants ask why they should even bear the bitter price of living in the Holy Land.

“There are things that make us worry about our very existence,” he said. “But without hope, more and more of us will leave.”

364,Philadelphia truck break-in ends in parking lot dime heist,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Thieves may not have been counting on finding a mountain of change when they broke into a truck filled with $750,000 in dimes, but they still made off with a chunk of the cargo and left coins scattered around a Philadelphia parking lot, authorities said.

Authorities say the thieves apparently fled with at least $100,000. It’s not yet known how they carted off the mounds of dimes.

The theft was reported around 6 a.m. Thursday. The tractor-trailer driver had picked up the dimes from the Philadelphia Mint on Wednesday, authorities said, and was planning to transport them to Florida on Thursday.

It’s not clear how many people may have been involved in the theft or if they knew what the truck contained. Responding police officers found hundreds of dimes scattered all over the parking lot, and authorities were still trying to determine how much money was stolen.

No arrests have been made.",0
365,Philippines tries to bring back small fish key to rural diet,"TANAUAN, Leyte, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines, a nation made up of thousands of islands, is home to about 1.6 million people who work in fisheries, and the majority of those fishers are small-scale harvesters who collectively catch almost half of the nation’s fish.

Years of market pressures, lack of fisheries management and unchecked overfishing from larger commercial fishers have led to a decline in small fish such as sardines that rural coastal communities in the country of about 110 million people depend on. Data is not available on the state of many fish stocks, but the conservation group Oceana has said more than 75% of the nation’s fishing grounds are depleted.

The problem of overfishing is especially detrimental to the country’s poorest people, many of whom earn their livings by fishing, said Ruperto Aleroza, an anti-poverty activist who has spent decades harvesting small fish like sardines and round scad from the waters around the archipelago. The small fish are important to the diet in parts of the Philippines where other sources of protein are not available, he said. The fish are used in traditional dishes such as kinilaw, a raw fish dish similar to ceviche.

“We fisherfolk are the second to the poorest in our country” behind only farmers, Aleroza said.

This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation. The AP is solely responsible for all content.

The challenge overfishing poses to people who earn their living from the sea and who count on fish for protein in their diet is being experienced throughout the world. As overfishing is impacting kinilaw in the Philippines, it’s effecting traditional dishes and ways of life in places such as the Bahamas, where scientists and government officials worry the commercial fishing of conch, a marine snail central to the diet and identify of the island nation, may soon no longer be feasible. And in Senegal, overfishing has largely wiped out white grouper, long the basis for the national dish of thieboudienne.

Aleroza blames years of poor fishing management and unsustainable fishing practices for taking away both a way of life and a key source of protein for some of his nation’s poorest people.

“It is threatening the local food source. We can’t feed our family. And it’s worsening poverty of artisanal fishers,” he said. “The overfishing worsens economic depression among us.”

Recently, the country has begun to make strides in rebuilding fisheries with spawning closures, said Mudjekeewis Santos, a scientist with the Philippines Department of Agriculture’s National Fisheries Research and Development Institute.

“And the communities are happy that happened, because their catch increased,” he said. “Fish don’t care about jurisdiction, and they’re being decimated.”

But there is much work left to be done, Santos said.

Non-governmental organizations such as the Environmental Defense Fund are working with the Philippines government to adopt science-based, sustainable fishing practices, said Edwina Garchitorena, who leads those efforts for EDF in the country.

The problem goes beyond small fish. The loss of small, ocean-going fish such as anchovies is also devastating for larger fish, which eat the small fish, she said.

Garchitorena and others blamed the over-exploitation of larger fish species to meet international demand, which she said increased fishing pressure on the smaller fish stocks that live closer to the coast.

“We’ve systematically reduced every type of fish in the ocean,” she said.",0
366,Chasing Horse's Nevada sex abuse trial on hold indefinitely,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The sexual abuse trial of a “Dances With Wolves” actor charged in Nevada with abusing Indigenous women and girls for more than a decade is on hold indefinitely, a state judge announced Wednesday.

Nathan Chasing Horse, 46, was originally set to stand trial May 1. He is charged with 18 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor, kidnapping, lewdness and child abuse.

Shortly after a grand jury in Las Vegas indicted him in February, Chasing Horse invoked his right to a trial within 60 days. But on Wednesday, his public defender, Kristy Holston, asked to put a pause on proceedings while they ask the Nevada Supreme Court to toss his indictment.

Clark County District Judge Carli Kierny said she would set a new trial date if the high court upholds her recent decision denying Chasing Horse’s request to dismiss the case. Chasing Horse and his attorneys argued that two women identified as his victims wanted to have sex with him.

Kierny, in her ruling issued Friday, said state prosecutors presented enough evidence for “a reasonable grand juror to conclude that the sexual assaults occurred.” While Kierny upheld the sexual abuse charges, she dismissed a drug trafficking charge, saying that there was no substantive testimony tying Chasing Horse to the psilocybin mushrooms investigators found while searching his home.

Holston and lead prosecutor Stacy Kollins declined to comment further after the hearing.

Kierny set a new hearing for May 10 to check on the status of Chasing Horse’s appeal to the high court, which had yet to be filed on Wednesday.

Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota and is widely known for his portrayal of Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costner’s 1990 film.

But police and prosecutors have said that in the decades since appearing in the Oscar-winning movie, Chasing Horse marketed himself to tribes nationwide as a medicine man with healing powers who could communicate with higher beings. They accuse him of using his position to lead a cult, gain access to vulnerable girls and women, and take underage wives starting in the early 2000s.

Chasing Horse’s indictment in state court stems from allegations made by two women — including one who says she was 14 when the sexual abuse began — but court records show authorities have identified at least four other victims in the U. S and in Canada.

The former actor’s arrest on Jan. 31 in Nevada sent shockwaves throughout Indian Country and led to more criminal charges in other jurisdictions, including in Canada and the U. S. District Court in Nevada, as well as on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana.

Chasing Horse is being held on $300,000 bail at a county jail in Las Vegas. If he posts bail, he likely would be turned over to federal authorities in Nevada.",0
367,"Makers of 'Elemental' explore family, tolerance and movement","MEXICO CITY (AP) — “Elemental” director Peter Sohn says his parents ignited the spark for the upcoming Disney and Pixar animated film.

Sohn invited his parents — who both had emigrated from Korea to the U. S. — to an event. Seeing them from the stage filled him with a deep appreciation for all they had done for their family.

“I saw them, and I was very emotional thanking them for all the sacrifices,” Sohn said in a recent video call interview for “Elemental,” a film about a family of fire elements who migrate to Element City, a place where there are also inhabitants of water, air and earth. The themes of family, tolerance and building connections run throughout the film debuting this summer.

The film centers on Ember, a fire element who loves working at her father’s store but has trouble controlling her explosive temper, especially around uncomfortable customers. Ember’s life in Firetown, a suburb with many inhabitants of fire, is turned upside down when, due to a plumbing accident, she meets Wade, a water element and inspector who lives in Element City. Ember and Wade get to know each other, and she enjoys being outside Firetown. They realize their differences — and elements — are not an impediment for friendship.

The production team faced a challenge in bringing the characters to life.

“We have been doing all sorts of different characters, from toys to cars... And that was another challenge,” said Spanish animator Jordi Onate. “We had to break all the rules that we knew from body mechanics...We did a lot of research on how the water behaves and how the fire behaves in certain situations and, on top of that, trying to make them talk.”

But the fact that they are elements also gave animators the ability to give the characters particular powers. For example, Ember’s a girl of fire. She can use that fire to remake broken glass and weld metal.

“This is one of the most complex projects I think we’ve worked on at Pixar, just because of that; we are used to animating humans or animals, and you have references for that, but in this case, we were trying to figure out how a character made of fire or water would move,” said Colombian animator Luis Uribe Córdoba. “We had like three or four weeks just to test out stuff and watch videos of slow-motion fire or water behavior.”

Development of the project began seven years ago. Mexican artist Paula Assadourian was one of the first to help Sohn find the essence of the characters and story. Assadourian, who began working on the film in 2019, was in charge of making the story board before production.

“I think “Elemental” is a very special film because it’s about Ember kind of coming to face (with) who she is and what she wants to do; if she wants to pursue her path or if she wants to kind of stay close to her roots and her family and what people expect her to be,” said Assadourian. “Wade changes Ember, or he kind of awakens her to say, ‘there’s so much more you can do with your life.’”

Sohn, who in addition to being a director is an animator, voice actor and artist, previously directed “The Good Dinosaur” and has collaborated on multiple Pixar films such as “Incredibles 2,” “Ratatouille,” “Finding Nemo,” “Up,” “Toy Story 3” and “WALL E.” But “Elemental” is the most personal story in which he has been involved.

The film shows that tolerance and empathy can combat evils such as xenophobia. Sohn says the “idea of xenophobia″ was a part of ”Elemental″ from the start.

“The idea of xenophobia was always in the story from the beginning (before the pandemic),” he said. “Because my father and mother experienced the same xenophobia, it wasn’t a new thing…(But) the idea of Asian hate that started happening in such boldface manners was really terrifying. I remember my mom calling me and saying don´t go out into San Francisco. She was terrified, and she had never been terrified to that level when we were growing up; it was a real fear.”

The film’s layers drew producer Denise Ream to collaborate with Sohn from the beginning of the project.

“The story had layers to it that I really appreciated, I just connected to it with the idea of thanking your parents, it really resonated a lot with me,” she said. “I really was excited about the visual and technical challenges, that really got me fired up. I knew (it) would be hard — it turned out to be a lot...harder than I thought it would be — but I like everything about it.”",0
368,First QB helmet designed to help reduce concussions approved,"The first quarterback-specific helmet designed to help reduce concussions has been approved for use by the NFL and NFLPA, the AP has learned.

The helmet, manufactured by Vicis, reduces severity of helmet-to-ground impacts, which league data says account for approximately half of quarterback concussions, including the one suffered by Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa last season when his head slammed violently against the turf during a Thursday night game against Cincinnati.

“We’ve now analyzed with our engineers and with the Players Association more than a 1,000 concussions on field, we have a pretty good database of how these injuries occur,” NFL executive Jeff Miller told the AP about the helmet-to-ground impacts. “This helmet performs better in laboratory testing than any helmets we have ever seen for those sorts of impacts.”

The helmet performed 7% better than the most popular helmet worn by quarterbacks last season, the league said in a memo sent to team executives on Thursday.

Jason Neubauer, an executive for Vicis, said the company began designing its Zero2 Matrix QB helmet in early 2022.

“The unique thing is that it has a deformal outer shell, which means when you take an impact in any location on that helmet, it will deform or basically dent in that location to absorb the impact,” Neubauer said. “What that means for us, as designers or engineers, as we’re looking to optimize it for different types of impacts, we’re able to change unique locations to try to optimize the impact mitigation in any one area.”

It’s unknown how many quarterbacks will switch to the new QB-specific helmet. The league and the players’ union share information from the helmet studies with teams so players make informed decisions on helmet choice. The only other position-specific helmet already approved is the Vicis Zero2-R Trench for offensive and defensive linemen.

The memo sent to teams also includes the results of the 2023 helmet laboratory testing study. Miller told the AP seven helmets the league highly recommended in 2020 have now been downgraded to prohibited as a result of new testing.

“That’s a great sign,” Miller said. “Hopefully we can continue to stimulate that either with position-specific helmets designed for each position group or for a general all-purpose helmet to be able to say to players: ‘Work with us, be willing to change helmets because better and better products are coming online every year.’”",0
369,"Williams back with Padres, won't coach for at least 4 weeks","SAN DIEGO (AP) — San Diego Padres third base coach Matt Williams already had baseball on his mind when the anesthesia was wearing off following colon cancer surgery two weeks ago.

“I woke up and I asked what time batting practice was. I let my brother know that I had to get to the ballpark so I could hit Croney grounders,” Williams said Thursday, referring to first baseman Jake Cronenworth. “I don’t know what that’s all about. My family has video of it so I’ll never live that one down. I was anxious to get back for sure.”

Williams won’t be hitting fungoes or coaching third base for at least four weeks while he continues to heal. But he’s back with the Padres and will watch games from the dugout. He has a follow-up appointment with his surgeon on Friday and hopes to be cleared to travel before the Padres’ next trip, which begins at Arizona next Thursday, when superstar Fernando Tatis Jr. is eligible to return from an 80-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug.

Williams, a five-time All-Star in a 17-year career spent mostly with the San Francisco Giants, was diagnosed during spring training and had surgery on March 31, a day after opening day.

“The surgery went really well. The doctor is confident she was able to get everything at the margin, which is good,” the 57-year-old Williams said before the Padres opened a series against the Milwaukee Brewers. “I feel great and happy to be back out here and do what I can to help.”

Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt has been coaching third in Williams’ absence.

“It’s a relief but there’s still a long way to go,” Williams said. “This diagnosis and this process is long-term. But I’m happy and I’m satisfied so far. I’ll take the next step when appropriate and go from there.”

Williams said his doctor is doing genetic tests, “which is really important for my family to know if it was a gene mutation or something. My children need to know that.”

Williams managed the Washington Nationals for two seasons and was the NL Manager of the Year in 2014. He was manager Bob Melvin’s third base coach in Oakland in 2018-19 and joined Melvin’s Padres staff last season.",0
370,Drama plagues bid to restrict changes to Ohio Constitution,"With an effort to enshrine abortion rights looming this fall, an influential mix of Republican politicians, lobbying organizations and business interests is positioning to try to make another change to the state’s founding document first. They’re pushing an amendment that would raise the threshold for passing future constitutional changes, including the abortion question, from the current 50%-plus-one to 60% of Ohio voters.

“This issue isn’t just about abortion,” said Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis, who represented a cross-section of conservative causes at recent strategy talks on the subject. “This is about family farming. This is about small businesses. This is around Second Amendment rights, setting the minimum wage.”

Despite that powerful line-up of conservative support, getting the 60% question to the ballot this August has been fraught with complications.

First, there’s the fact that Statehouse Republicans voted to eliminate most August special elections last year. GOP Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the state’s elections chief and a likely 2024 U. S. Senate candidate, was among the measure’s highest profile supporters, testifying: “These unnecessary ‘off-cycle’ elections aren’t good for taxpayers, election officials or the civic health of our state. It’s time for them to go!”

LaRose and powerful Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman, a fellow Republican, have now changed course, realizing the political stakes. Both favor reinstating August elections — at least, just this once — after lawmakers missed the deadline for a May vote. LaRose says a well-publicized statewide issue “is a very different thing” than the low turnout local ballot questions he opined against in December.

The swiftly timed reversal didn’t go over well with Republican Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens, who has struggled to conduct business with a fractured supermajority caucus.

“Let me be abundantly clear. I am and have always been 100% Pro-Life,” Stephens tweeted on March 24. “I will stand for life at every turn; however, I am not for changing the rules willy nilly at a whim when it comes to changing our constitution.” Among Stephens’ concerns were the burden and expense an August election would impose on already stressed local election officials.

Stephens has since called August “a possibility.” Those comments came the same day fellow Republicans launched an effort to thwart his authority and push the 60% threshold resolution directly to the House floor. The effort would prevent Stephens from delaying a vote past May 10, the deadline for a $20 million August election the resolution will reinstate.

“Republicans aren’t going to put it on the same ballot as the abortion issue,” said ex-House Constitutional Resolutions Committee Chair Scott Wiggam, whom Stephens ousted as chair after he worked at cross purposes to his own committee by signing the petition. “That’s because if they both pass with 50%-plus-one, then abortion would be protected by a 60% threshold into the future.”

That’s not to say it would even pass if it reaches the floor.

A lack of the necessary three-fifths majority tanked a similar resolution during last year’s lame duck session — and not just because minority Democrats and a large coalition of advocacy groups organized against it are opposed.

Among Republicans, some constitutional purists worry about the unforeseen consequences of changing a simple majority requirement in place since 1912. Others are concerned about opposition to the idea among GOP voters, particularly in rural areas that look unkindly on government overreach.

About a dozen sitting GOP lawmakers, for instance, supported the legislative version of a pending medical freedom amendment aimed at preventing COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Diana Smith, the conservative from Bradford in western Ohio who is gathering signatures for that effort, said it’s unfair to require its backers to win an additional 10% of the Ohio electorate.

“Whether you’re Republican or Democrat, we’re all citizens, we’re all one,” she said. “It’s been in our Constitution that one greater than 50% should be the majority, and I feel that it should stay that way, that we the people are the ones that should be in charge of our government.”

Rob Sexton, legislative affairs director for the Buckeye Firearms Association, is among the coalition of groups in the GOP-controlled state pushing for the 60% requirement. They are watching gun control or “right to food” amendments pass in other states with trepidation.

“Ballot issues, in general, have increasingly become almost completely influenced by whoever has the most money,” he said. “So when you’re talking about our state’s foundational document, then we believe it needs protection from large national organizations that may not have Ohio values but are able to bankroll multi-million ballot campaigns in our state.”

In Ohio, 59% of voters in last year’s midterm elections said abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of over 90,000 U. S. voters. Only 7% of Ohio voters said abortion should be illegal in all cases.

The way its Republican backers have overtly tied the 60% idea to sinking an abortion rights measure that could potentially prevail in Ohio otherwise appears to have weakened would-be support elsewhere.

Two of the state’s most powerful pro-business groups — the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Business Roundtable — have so far remained neutral on both amendments.

The Chamber hosted and the Roundtable attended the March strategy meeting with Gonidakis; state Rep. Brian Stewart, the resolution’s sponsor; Wiggam and others whose support for the higher threshold is unrelated to abortion. But the two heavy hitters — run by former Republican U. S. Reps. Steve Stivers and Pat Tiberi, respectively — generally don’t wade into social issues on which their corporate members, and the state, might be divided.

While the proposal’s immediate targets are abortion rights, recreational marijuana legalization, a minimum wage increase and redistricting reform, some conservatives recognize a 60% threshold could hurt their own future constitutional efforts.

The conservative American Policy Roundtable, which has backed a host of successful Ohio constitutional amendments over the years, is opposed, for example.

Across the U. S., states are declaring constitutional rights to own guns, to hunt and fish, and to farm. Meanwhile, in Wyoming just last month, the constitutional right to make one’s own healthcare decisions — added to constitutions in Ohio and elsewhere in a push by opponents of the federal Affordable Care Act — was used to protect abortion access. That could prompt conservatives to try to repeal it someday.",0
371,Ex-Theranos executive headed to prison after losing appeal,"Former Theranos executive Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani will be heading to prison later this month after an appeals court rejected his bid to remain free while he contests his conviction for carrying out a blood-testing hoax with his former boss and lover, Elizabeth Holmes.

After the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision refusing Balwani’s request, U. S District Judge Edward Davila on Friday ordered him to start his nearly 13-year prison sentence on April 20.

One of Balwani’s lawyers had filed a motion late Thursday seeking nearly two weeks to give Balwani time to make travel arrangements and make other preparations for a trip that will send him to a federal prison in Southern California.

The April 20 reporting date means Balwani will be heading to prison a week before Holmes, Theranos’ founder and CEO, is scheduled to begin a more than 11-year prison sentence after being convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy last year.

Holmes, 39, appeared before Davila last month along with her lawyers in an effort to persuade the judge to allow her to remain free while she pursues her own appeal. Davila hasn’t ruled on Holmes’ request yet.

Davila last month rejected Balwani’s request to remain free while he appeals his conviction on 12 counts of fraud and conspiracy and ordered him to report to prison March 16. Balwani then avoided having to report on that date by appealing Davila’s ruling against him.

But three judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded Balwani hadn’t provided enough compelling evidence to convince them that his conviction is likely to be overturned.

Balwani will serve his sentence in a prison near a harbor in San Pedro, California, located about 30 miles (50 kilometers) from downtown Los Angeles. The Terminal Island prison has incarcerated several other prominent figures, including gangster Al Capone in the 1930s, apocalyptic cult leader Charles Manson for an auto theft in the 1950s, and LSD evangelist Timothy Leary in the 1970s.

Although they had separate trials, Holmes and Balwani were accused of essentially the same crimes centered on a ruse touting Theranos’ blood-testing system as a revolutionary breakthrough in health care. The claims helped the company become a Silicon Valley sensation that raised nearly $1 billion from investors.

But its technology never came close to working like Holmes and Balwani boasted, resulting in Theranos’ scandalous collapse and a criminal case that shined a bright light on Silicon Valley greed and hubris.",0
372,Florida man sentenced for role in Jan. 6 Capitol attack,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Florida man was sentenced Thursday to eight months in federal prison for his role in the insurrection and storming of the U. S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Howard Adams, 62, of Edgewater, Florida, was sentenced in federal court in the District of Columbia, according to court records. He pleaded guilty in January to a felony charge of interfering with law enforcement officers during a civil disorder.

Adams was arrested in Edgewater in March 2021.

According to court documents, Adams joined with others in objecting to Democrat Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over then-President Donald Trump. A mob attacked the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying election results for Biden over the Trump, a Republican, authorities have said. Five people died in the violence.

According to the criminal complaint, Adams unlawfully approached the U. S. Capitol after rioters pushed through a line of United States Capitol Police officers. Adams eventually entered the Rotunda and then went through Statuary Hall, officials said. Prosecutors said Adams went to the House chamber doorway, where he joined a group chanting, “Break it down!” and “Stop the steal!”

Unable to break down the door, Adams returned to the Rotunda, investigators said. Adams ignored orders from law enforcement officers to exit the building and made contact with an officer who attempted to push him toward an exit door, officials said. Adams eventually left the building about an hour after entering.

Since Jan. 6, 2021, more than 1,000 people have been arrested in nearly all 50 states for alleged crimes related to the Capitol breach, officials said. More than 320 people have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.",0
373,Nebraska lawmakers advance bill to vastly restrict abortion,"LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday that would ban abortion once cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, which is generally around the sixth week of pregnancy and before most women even know they are pregnant.

Thirty-three lawmakers voted to end debate on the bill — just enough needed to set up an identical 33-16 vote to advance the bill. If just one other lawmaker had voted not to end debate, the bill would likely have been declared dead for the year. It must survive two more rounds of debate before the end of the 90-day session to pass.

The effort to pass the so-called heartbeat bill in the Republican-controlled state remains in question. An amendment floated by a Republican co-signer of the bill that would push the ban out to 12 weeks of pregnancy has yet to be considered. The amendment — and concerns expressed by at least one lawmaker who voted to advance the bill — could signal that a ban set very early in pregnancy may face pushback even from those who want further abortion restrictions.

Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner is also a co-sponsor of the bill, which includes exceptions for cases of rape, incest and medical emergencies that threaten the life of the mother. But she said during debate Wednesday that concerns shared with her by a couple of Nebraska doctors have given her pause on the current bill. She’s concerned, she said, that it doesn’t make allowances for fetal anomalies.

“I think we have to listen to both sides,” she said. “I do think the 12 week proposal would be a compromise.”

Ibach said she voted to advance the bill to allow for more debate on it this session.

The bill makes specific exceptions for ectopic pregnancies, IVF procedures, and allows for the removal of a fetus that has died in the womb. It also does not ascribe criminal penalties to either women who receive or doctors who perform abortions. Instead, it would subject doctors who perform abortions in violation of the measure to professional discipline, which could include losing their medical licenses.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, has been a vocal proponent of the bill and has said he will sign it if it passes.

Debate grew contentious at times Wednesday, with lawmakers for and against the bill accusing each other of spreading misinformation and using inflammatory rhetoric.

Supporters of the bill quoted Bible verses and extolled personal and religious beliefs that life begins at conception. Sen. Steve Halloran of Hastings who is white, claimed that the legalization of abortion in the U. S. had its roots not in choice for women, but in a racist plot to “kill off the Black race.”

Opponents of the bill said it would strip women of their right to bodily autonomy, put them at financial and medical risk, and drive medical professionals and others concerned about abortion access out of the state. While the bill doesn’t list any criminal penalties for women who get abortions and doctors who perform them, some lament that there is no specific language guaranteeing they won’t face charges.

“To be honest, a lot of doctors have their resignation letters ready to go,” said Omaha Sen. Megan Hunt, who introduced a failed amendment to indefinitely postpone the bill.

Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln referred to news reports in the past year of women and girls who were unable to get immediate abortion care following rapes or in the face of life-threatening complications because of their states’ abortion bans.

“Those are real things, and you’re bringing them to Nebraska,” she said.

Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who introduced the bill, said she understood there are strong opinions centered on abortion access.

“This bill is about babies with beating hearts, and they deserve to be protected,” she said.

The debate drew hundreds of people both for and against the bill to the Capitol, where dueling rallies by abortion rights and anti-abortion groups were held.

Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston introduced the amendment to push the ban to 12 weeks last month, saying he was concerned that the current proposal might not give women enough time to know that they’re pregnant. But he also voted Wednesday to advance the bill.

Nebraska has the only single-chamber, officially nonpartisan legislature in the United States. But each of its 49 lawmakers identify as Republican or Democrat and tend to propose and vote for legislation along party lines. Republicans hold 32 seats, while Democrats hold 17 seats. Although bills can advance with a simple majority, it takes a supermajority — 33 votes — to end debate to overcome a filibuster. So a single lawmaker breaking from the party line could decide whether a bill advances or dies for the year.

Omaha Sen. Mike McDonnell, a Democrat, voted Wednesday with Republicans to advance the bill. His reason, he said, is that he is a devout Roman Catholic who has always campaigned as an anti-abortion candidate.

The close divide in the Legislature played heavily in the defeat last year of a so-called trigger bill that would have automatically banned nearly all abortions in the state, even those resulting from rape and incest, as soon as the U. S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That bill fell two votes short.

That failure came as a surprise in a state that had a history as a leader in abortion restrictions. In 2010, Nebraska enacted the country’s first law banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on the disputed theory that a fetus at that point can feel pain.

But Nebraska anti-abortion advocates have watched in frustration as other GOP-controlled states have moved quickly to ban or restrict abortion access since the fall of Roe. Abortion is already effectively banned at all stages of pregnancy in more than a dozen states. That number would be higher, except that courts have blocked bans in another six states.

Dueling federal court decisions handed down last week have also thrown into question access to abortion pills.",0
374,"Myers helps Reds win 6-2 over Phillies, who drop to 4-9","CINCINNATI (AP) — Wil Myers hit a pair of run-scoring singles and the Cincinnati Reds beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-2 on Thursday night after getting swept in a three-game series at Atlanta.

Spencer Steer, Tyler Stephenson and Jose Barrero drove in runs for the Reds, who had lost six of seven after a 3-1 start — the last four all by one run.

“We had a meeting today,” Reds manager David Bell said. “The message was to fight for every pitch, kind of doubling down on who we are.

“The singles were big, the two out hits, the add on runs is what our offense did. Wil has been doing this for quite a while. He’s a good hitter and knows what he’s doing.”

Kyle Schwarber became the first left-handed batter to hit a home run off Nick Lodolo (2-0), a left-hander in his second major league season. The defending National League champions have lost three straight and are 4-9.

Lodolo allowed two runs and eight hits in five innings.

“It is a different type of satisfaction,” Lodolo said. “It was definitely a grind. It is not how you draw it up, but I’m happy with the result over all. I kept us in the game there and the bullpen was able to come in and throw the ball really well.”

Bailey Falter (0-2) gave up five runs and eight hits in in 4 2/3 innings.

“Guys were seeing the ball well,” Falter said. “I missed a couple of spots. The inning got away from me.”

Nick Castellanos put the Phillies ahead with an RBI single in the first but Jonathan India created the tying run in the bottom half when he doubled, stole third and continued home when third baseman Edmundo Sosa allowed catcher J. T. Realmuto’s throw past him into left field for an error.

Cincinnati took a 4-1 lead in the third with five singles, four of them in a row, all with two outs. Steer, Stephenson and Myers drove in runs.

“Two-out hitting is how you win ballgames,” Steer said,

Schwarber, who grew up about 25 miles north of Cincinnati in Middletown, Ohio, led off the fifth with his fourth home run, a 438-foot drive. He has 12 home runs and 26 RBIs in 40 games at Great American Ball Park.

Myers added an RBI single off Andrew Bellatti in the fifth and Barrero hit a run-scoring double in the sixth against McKinley Moore.

Phillies second baseman Bryson Stott needed to beat out a ninth-inning, two-out infield single to extend his career-high hitting streak to 13 games.

Philadelphia first baseman Alec Bohm singled with two outs in the third to extend to 13 his streak of games reaching base at least once, Philadelphia’s longest to start a season since Bryce Harper reached in the Phillies’ first 22 games of the 2020 season.

Moore hit Kevin Newman and India with pitches in the sixth. Both players stayed in the game.

Phillies: 1B Darick Hall’s surgery on Wednesday to repair a torn ligament in his thumb well, according to manager Rob Thomson.

Reds: INF/OF Nick Senzel was activated from the 10-day IL following left big toe surgery was went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. OF Will Benson was optioned to Triple-A Louisville.

Phillies RHP Taijuan Walker (0-1) is scheduled to face Reds RHP Connor Overton (0-0) on Friday.",0
375,Maine abortion bill has enough co-sponsors to ensure passage,"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Democratic Gov. Janet Mills’ bill to expand abortion access in Maine will generate emotional debate in coming weeks, but its eventual passage is virtually assured.

There were enough co-sponsors on her bill, formally introduced this week, to ensure passage with a majority. All told, there were 76 sponsors and co-sponsors in the House and 20 in the Senate, all Democrats or independents.

The governor’s bill would change the standard for women to get abortions later in pregnancy in Maine. It also would change reporting requirements and strengthen legal protections for medical providers.

“This bill will help make sure every person who needs abortion care in Maine can get the care they need, when they need it,” said Nicole Clegg, acting CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.

Maine’s current state law allows abortions until a fetus becomes viable outside the womb, at roughly 24 weeks, but there’s an exception allowing late abortions to preserve the life or health of the mother. The governor’s bill would change the exception to allow abortions after viability if it’s necessary in the professional judgment of a physician.

Republicans lashed out on Wednesday in a press conference, arguing that current law is sufficient and attacking the governor for reneging on a campaign vow to leave the state’s abortion law alone.

“This gives the word ‘extreme’ new meaning. It would allow the abortion of a baby up to full term, one that could survive outside the womb. That is extreme,” state Sen. Lisa Keim, R-Oxford, told reporters.

The bill’s printing came days after a federal judge in Texas issued a ruling that could make the nation’s most common drug for medication abortions unlawful. The Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone 23 years ago.

In pressing for the bill, the governor cited the example of a Maine woman who had to travel out of state to end her pregnancy after an ultrasound showed her son had a deadly condition. In this case, the mother’s life was not in peril so she couldn’t get an abortion in Maine, even though her doctor recommended an abortion because her son would’ve been unable to breathe.

“All medical care, including the very personal and private decision of abortion, is best determined in an office by patients and trusted health care providers focused on consensus, evidence-based medical decision-making,” said Dr. Erik Steele, president of the Maine Medical Association, which supports the governor’s bill.",0
376,US probes crash involving Tesla that hit student leaving bus,"DETROIT (AP) — U. S. road safety regulators have sent a team to investigate a crash involving a Tesla that may have been operating on a partially automated driving system when it struck a student who had just exited a school bus.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Friday that it will probe the March 15 crash in Halifax County, North Carolina, that injured a 17-year-old student. The State Highway Patrol said the driver of the 2022 Tesla Model Y, a 51-year-old male, failed to stop for the bus, which was displaying all of its activated warning devices.

Sending special investigation teams to crashes means that the agency suspects the Teslas were operating systems that can handle some aspects of driving, including Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving.” Despite the names, Tesla says these are driver-assist systems and that drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.

Tillman Mitchell, a student at the Haliwa-Saponi Tribal School in Hollister, had just exited the bus and was walking across the street to his house when he was hit, according to the Highway Patrol.

He was flown to a hospital with life-threatening injuries but was listed in good condition two days after the crash.

Messages left with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol were not immediately returned Friday. A spokesperson for WakeMed hospital in Raleigh did not immediately provide an update on the student’s condition or indicate whether he had been discharged.

NHTSA has sent investigative teams to more than 30 crashes since 2016 in which Teslas suspected of operating on Autopilot or “Full Self-Driving” have struck pedestrians, motorcyclists, semi trailers and parked emergency vehicles. At least 14 people were killed in the crashes.

In March the agency sent a team to a Feb. 18 crash in which a Tesla Model S hit a fire department ladder truck in Contra Costa County, California. The Tesla driver was killed, a passenger was seriously hurt, and four firefighters suffered minor injuries.

Authorities said the California firetruck had its lights on and was parked diagonally on a highway to protect responders to an earlier accident that did not result in injuries.

The probes are part of a larger investigation by NHTSA into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations.

NHTSA is investigating how the Autopilot system detects and responds to emergency vehicles parked on highways.

The agency wouldn’t comment on open investigations, but it has been scrutinizing Teslas more intensely in the past year, seeking several recalls.

Tesla and NHTSA need to determine why the vehicles don’t seem to see flashing lights on school buses and emergency vehicles and make sure the problem is fixed, said Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety in Washington.

“I’ve been saying probably for a couple of years now, they need to figure out why these vehicles aren’t recognizing flashing lights for a big starter,” Brooks said. “NHTSA needs to step in and get them to do a recall because that’s a serious safety issue.”

Earlier this month the agency revealed an investigation of steering wheels that can detach from the steering column on as many as 120,000 Model Y SUVs. It’s also investigating seat belts that may not be anchored securely in some Teslas.

NHTSA also has opened investigations during the past three years into Teslas braking suddenly for no reason, suspension problems and other issues.

In February, NHTSA pressured Tesla into recalling nearly 363,000 vehicles with “Full Self-Driving” software because the system can break traffic laws. The problem was to be fixed with an online software update.

The system is being tested on public roads by as many as 400,000 Tesla owners. But NHTSA said in documents that it can make unsafe actions such as traveling straight through an intersection from a turn-only lane, going through a yellow traffic light without proper caution or failing to respond to speed limit changes.

The U. S. Justice Department also has asked Tesla for documents from Tesla about “Full Self-Driving” and Autopilot.

377,Gov. DeSantis surrogates escalate tit-for-tat versus Disney,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees to Disney World’s governing board have launched a fresh salvo in the fight to control the resort, seeking to expand their authority after their Disney-controlled predecessors abdicated most powers to the company.

Supervisors of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District are floating a resolution saying the board has “superior authority” over all land development decisions for the 27,000 acres that make up Walt Disney World, including for two tiny Disney controlled cities in the district. The board is set to vote on the resolution next week.

The proposal comes two weeks after board members say their Disney-controlled predecessors pulled a fast one by stripping the new board of most powers before DeSantis’ hand-picked members could take their seats.

Five new supervisors were appointed by the Republican governor after the Florida Legislature overhauled Disney’s government in retaliation for the entertainment giant publicly opposing the state’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” legislation barring school instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.

The proposed resolution is likely a starting point for future legal tussles between the new board and Disney, said Richard Foglesong, a Rollins College professor emeritus who wrote a definitive account of Disney World’s governance in his book, “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.”

“A key question will be whether a board created by the Legislature and appointed by the governor can rescind the constitutionally granted authority of democratically elected local governments,” Foglesong said.

In taking on Disney, DeSantis advanced his reputation as a culture warrior willing to battle political opponents and wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals. It’s a strategy he’s likely to follow through his expected 2024 run for the White House.

The new supervisors replaced a board controlled by Disney for the previous 55 years, which operated as the Reedy Creek Improvement District. Among its last acts in February was giving Disney control over design and construction at the theme park resort. Reedy Creek board members also prohibited their successors from using the name “Disney” or any symbols associated with the theme park without the company’s permission, and barred the new board from using the likeness of Mickey Mouse, other Disney characters or other intellectual property.

An email seeking comment from Disney was sent on Wednesday.

Experts said the latest proposed resolution won’t impact the previous board’s agreement with Disney.

“This is about the district controlled by the governor’s appointees passing a law that its land development rules prevail over the rules of the cities, which are still controlled by popular vote (made up entirely of Disney voters),” Jacob Schumer, an Orlando attorney specializing in local government and land use, said in an email.

Two tiny cities fall within the Disney district. According to the 2020 census, Bay Lake had 29 residents and Lake Buena Vista had 24. The two municipalities were formed to support the legal framework of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which was established by the Florida Legislature in 1967.

The cities have elected city councils and mayors who contract with local law enforcement for police services at Disney World, and could be used to assert the company’s autonomy over the resort. The cities’ residents are employees, former employees or others with close ties to Disney.",0
378,Actor Drake Bell found safe after being declared missing,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Jared “Drake” Bell, an actor best known as a star of the Nickelodeon television show “Drake & Josh,” was found safe on Thursday, hours after authorities in Florida said he was “missing and endangered.”

Bell was in touch with police officers and wasn’t in danger, Daytona Beach Police Department spokesperson Carrie McCallister said in an email, without providing further details.

“At this time we can confirm law enforcement officials are in contact and Mr. Bell is safe,” McCallister said.

McCallister referred requests for further details to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office in Orlando, which didn’t respond to an emailed message.

Hours earlier, the police department put out a statement declaring Bell “missing and endangered” and asked the public for help in locating him.

Before being found mid-day Thursday, Bell was last seen Wednesday night near a Daytona Beach high school.

Representatives for the 36-year-old actor did not immediately reply to The Associated Press’ requests for comment.

Bell began acting as a child and was catapulted to fame as a teen with Nickelodeon’s “The Amanda Show” and later “Drake & Josh.” The Nickelodeon show starring Bell and Josh Peck ran from 2004 until 2007, and was accompanied by two movies. Since then, Bell has mostly worked as a voice actor in addition to roles in little-seen TV series and movies. He also launched a music career.

In 2021, Bell was charged with child endangerment relating to a girl who attended a 2017 concert of his in Cleveland when she was 15 and had met him online years before. He pleaded guilty to felony attempted child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles and was sentenced to two years’ probation. He was allowed to serve his probation and 200 hours of community service in California.",0
379,"Dairy farm explosion injures 1 person, kills 18,000 cattle","DIMMITT, Texas (AP) — An explosion at a dairy farm in the Texas Panhandle that critically injured one person and killed an estimated 18,000 head of cattle is the deadliest barn fire recorded since the Animal Welfare Institute began tracking the fires.

Castro County Sheriff Salvador Rivera has said the Monday fire and explosion at Southfork Dairy Farm near Dimmitt was likely caused by overheated equipment and would be investigated by state fire marshals.

“This would be the most deadly fire involving cattle in the past decade, since we started tracking that in 2013,” institute spokesperson Marjorie Fishman said Thursday.

The institute also tracks barn fires that kill other livestock, including poultry, pigs, goats and sheep.

“The deadliest barn fire overall since we began tracking in 2013 ... was a fire ... at Hi-Grade Egg Producers North, Manchester, Indiana, which killed 1 million chickens,” according to Fishman.

A 2022 report by the institute noted “several instances in which 100,000 to 400,000 chickens were killed in a single fire.”

A spokesperson for the state insurance department, which oversees the fire marshals’ office, said only that the fire is under investigation and referred questions to Rivera, who did not immediately return phone calls for comment Thursday.

Dimmitt is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Amarillo and 50 miles east of the New Mexico border.",0
380,"Wasted gas hurts climate, state revenue","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Louisiana lost more than $82 million worth of natural gas in 2019 due to leaks, venting or flaring at production sites, according to a study released Thursday by an environmental group and government watchdog organizations.

The Environmental Defense Fund’s report said state fossil fuel producers wasted more than 27 billion cubic feet (760 million cubic meters) of gas in 2019. It’s an economic loss for the state, the report said, estimating the tax and royalty revenue lost to state government that year at $2.5 million. The report also said it was an environmental hazard because methane, a major component of natural gas, is a contributor to climate change.

More than 81% of wasted gas was from leaks. Less than 1% was from purposeful venting, and 19% was lost by flaring. Releasing gas by venting small amounts or by burning it is done for a variety of possible reasons involving safety and economics.

“That’s enough lost gas to meet more than 2/3 of residential natural gas demand in the state for a year,” a statement accompanying the report said.

The research was done by Synapse Energy Economics Inc., a consulting firm that lists various environmental groups and municipal, state and federal agencies among its clients.

The report comes as the federal Environmental Protection Agency considers rules aimed at preventing gas releases, including inspection requirements for well sites. The state also is setting in motion a process for developing rules to deal with the issues, said Patrick Courreges, spokesperson for the state Department of Natural Resources.

That includes what other oil and gas producing states are adopting and seeing how those regulations might work in Louisiana. Courreges, while not commenting on the accuracy of the report’s figures, said reducing gas emissions is a department goal.

“We’d rather keep it in the pipes and send it somewhere doing work,” he said in a telephone interview.

State and federal authorities also have stepped up efforts to address leaks from “orphan wells” — non-producing, abandoned well sites that are still leaking contaminants.

Two watchdog groups joined the Environmental Defense Fund in calling for policies to address the issue.

“Outdated policies keep billions of dollars’ worth of natural gas from getting to market at a time when budgets are tight and energy security is important as ever,” Autumn Hanna, vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in a statement issued by the fund.

“When the industry is allowed to waste natural gas, it robs the state of important tax revenue, which then has to be made up through other taxes or else leave the state without the revenue it needs to fund critical programs,” added Jan Moller of the Louisiana Budget Project.",0
381,"Among U.S. Latinos, Catholicism still largest faith","NEW YORK (AP) — Catholics remain the largest religious group among Latinos in the United States, but the number of Latinos who identify as religiously unaffiliated continues to grow.

Those are among the key findings in a comprehensive report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center that surveyed 7,647 U. S. adults in Aug. 1-14 of last year.

The report, which uses the terms Latino and Hispanic interchangeably, found that Catholicism remains the largest faith among Latinos in the U. S., even as the number of Latino adults who identify as Catholic steadily declined over the past decade. The number went from 67% in 2010 to 43% last year.

Still, the survey said Latinos remain about twice as likely as U. S. adults overall to identify as Catholic, and less likely to be Protestant.

“Latinos, especially here in the U. S., are still very faith-centered,” said the Rev. Carlos Velasquez, pastor at St. Brigid, a majority Latino Catholic church in an area straddling Brooklyn and Queens in New York City.

“Faith is a big part of all of people’s lives in Latin America ... and when they come here, faith is what grounds them,” he said. The church helps with the difficult transition of emigration, when many are starting from scratch, he added.

Latinos who are religiously unaffiliated – describing themselves as atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular” – are now about 30% of the overall Latino population. That’s up from 18% a decade ago and 10% in 2010. The numbers of Latinos who are religiously unaffiliated is in line with U. S. adults overall, the report said.

The religiously unaffiliated — commonly known as the “nones” – are the fastest-growing group in surveys asking Americans about their religious identity.

“Even though Latinx Americans may be, like all other Americans, increasingly unaffiliated, that certainly doesn’t mean they’re non-religious,” said Elizabeth Drescher, an adjunct professor at Santa Clara University who wrote a book about the spiritual lives of the nones.

“They may not be engaged in institutional religion for a variety of reasons, but they may still have the kind of classic of religious measures of religiosity — like belief in God or a higher power,” she said.

The poll says the “demographic forces shaping the nation’s Latino population also have impacted religious affiliation trends.”

Among U. S. Latinos ages 18 to 29, 79% were born in the U.S. Nearly half (49%) in this age group now identify as religiously unaffiliated. But only about one-in-five Latinos 50 and older are unaffiliated. Most of these older Latinos (56%) were born outside the U.S.

Overall, 52% of Latino immigrants identify as Catholic and 21% are unaffiliated. U. S.-born Latinos are less likely to be Catholic (36%) and more likely to be unaffiliated (39%), according to a 2022 Pew survey of Latino adults.

Hispanic Americans are also strikingly underrepresented in Catholic schools and in the priesthood.

Nearly a quarter of all U. S. Hispanics are former Catholics: While about two-thirds of Hispanic adults (65%) say they were raised Catholic, 43% say they are currently Catholic, according to the survey.

“What’s happening to Catholic Latinos (in the U. S.) is what’s happening to Catholics across the world,” said the Rev. Felix Sanchez, pastor of St. Pius V, a majority Latino parish in New York City’s Jamaica, Queens.

“People are attending church less,” he said. Young people are participating less in their parishes. He cautioned against presenting Latinos as a monolithic group, though.

“It’s not the same to talk about an Argentine than an Ecuadorean, or a Mexican. And it’s not the same a first generation versus a third generation,” Sanchez said. “They all have different histories, traditions. What unites us is that we understand each other because we share the same language, but each one has its own cultural richness. — and we have to respect that.”

Protestants are the second-largest faith group after Catholics, the report says. They account for 21% of Hispanic adults — a number that has remained relatively stable since 2010 — with 15% of Latinos identifying as evangelical Protestants.

“Latino evangelicals have received national attention recently due to the political activism of some evangelical churches,” the survey says.

“The interest in Latino evangelicals comes as white evangelicals have become a bulwark of support for Republican candidates in U. S. presidential elections, and after elections in which a rising share of Latino voters have supported Republican candidates.”

Republican candidates across the U. S. are seeking to expand recent gains the party has made with Hispanic voters from Florida to California. What seems to be driving them are bread-and-butter issues, including crime, struggling schools, as well as food and gas prices creeping beyond their paychecks’ reach.

The report says 28% of Hispanic Republicans identify as evangelical Protestants compared to 10% who identify as Democrats.

Latino immigrants are slightly more likely than U. S.-born Latinos to be evangelical (19% vs. 12%). “Evangelicalism is especially prevalent among Latinos with Central American origins, mirroring a pattern seen in those countries. Roughly three-in-ten Central Americans (31%) say they are evangelical Protestants,” the report says.

Among evangelical Protestants who are Latino, half identify with the Republican Party or are independents who lean toward the GOP; and 44% are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents.

Among Latino Catholics, by contrast, 72% identify as Democrats.

Religiously unaffiliated Latinos are also mostly Democratic (66%).

Most U. S. Latinos (65%) also say they were raised Catholic. Far fewer say they were raised Protestant (18%) or religiously unaffiliated (13%).

Older Latinos and those born outside the U. S. are especially likely to say they were raised Catholic, the report says.

“Like all Americans, many Latinos switch away from their childhood religion,” it says, adding that one-third of Latino adults said their current religion is different from their childhood faith.

The poll’s margin of error, for the full sample of respondents, is plus or minus 1.7 percentage points.

382,Military hospital chided for shift in Catholic pastoral care,"The management of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center has drawn criticism from a prominent archbishop — and some members of Congress — by choosing not to renew a contract for Franciscan priests to provide pastoral care, and instead hiring a secular firm to oversee provision of those services going forward.

For nearly two decades, priests from the Holy Name College Friary in Silver Spring, Maryland, had ministered to service members and veterans hospitalized at Walter Reed, a renowned medical facility in nearby Bethesda.

Walter Reed said it notified the Franciscans in March that their contract would not be renewed, and that another bidder for the new contract had been selected — secular defense contractor Mack Global LLC.

The medical center said it issued a cease-and-desist order on April 4 — in the midst of Holy Week — when Franciscans continued to provide pastoral services after their contract expired on March 31.

The events dismayed Timothy Broglio, who is president of the U. S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and also is archbishop for the Military Services.

“I fear that giving a contract to the lowest bidder overlooked the fact that the bidder cannot provide the necessary service,” Broglio said in a statement last week. “

On Wednesday, Broglio provided an updated response to The Associated Press.

“The Archdiocese has been assured that the situation will be rectified and waits to learn of the outcome of the efforts to ensure appropriate care so that the First Amendment rights of patients and staff at the Medical Center will be respected,” he said.

Walter Reed, in a lengthy statement of its own, said it “honors and supports a full range of religious, spiritual, and cultural needs.”

The statement said the new contract offered to Mack Global “is under review to ensure it adequately supports the religious needs of our patients and beneficiaries.”

For now, the medical center said, an active-duty Army priest on its staff is providing Catholic pastoral services, supplemented as warranted by other priests in the region.

The medical center declined to say whether it was dissatisfied in any way with the services provided by the Franciscans. It also declined to provide any monetary figure for the new and previous contracts.

Asked for comment, the Franciscans provided a statement Wednesday expressing pride in the services they had provided to Walter Reed.

“While this is certainly disappointing after 20 years of service – after building trust and so many wonderful relationships and friendships – the Franciscan Friars of Holy Name Province respect the process,” the statement said. “It has been an incredible privilege – and, really, a very powerful ministerial experience – for the Franciscan Friars to be invited into the lives of these true American heroes who have sacrificed so much for our country.”

Walter Reed is one of many U. S. military medical centers whose pastoral care lies within the Archdiocese for Military Services, headed by Broglio.

The statement issued by Broglio’s office last week was stinging: “The refusal to provide adequate pastoral care while awarding a contract for Catholic ministry to a for-profit company that has no way of providing Catholic priests to the medical center is a glaring violation of service members’ and veterans’ Right to the Free Exercise of Religion.”

The developments have drawn the attention of several Republican members of Congress who criticize Walter Reed’s action. Among them was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who tweeted that the decision was “incredibly embarrassing and wrong.”

Eleven other members of Congress, including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Roger Marshall of Kansas, sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin inquiring why the contract was awarded to a secular contractor “which cannot fulfill the statement of work.”

“We have made promises to our service members and veterans that if they take care of us, we will take care of them,” the letter said. “This extends to not just providing quality healthcare at our nation’s military medical facilities, but by also providing the ability to freely practice their religion to those under the care at these facilities.”

Tony nominations will be announced May 2.

DeBose is a theater veteran, with roles in “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” “Hamilton,” “A Bronx Tale,” “Pippin,” “Motown the Musical,” “Bring It On: The Musical” and “Company.” She won an Oscar for her role in Steven Spielberg’s remake of “West Side Story” and can be seen in the new season of “Schmigadoon!” on Apple TV+.

“A Strange Loop” took the best new musical crown at the last Tony Awards. Joaquina Kalukango won for best leading actress in a musical, and Myles Frost moonwalked away with the award for best lead actor in a musical for playing Michael Jackson.

At that Tonys, DeBose broached the subject of diversity and representation on Broadway, saying it was becoming “more reflective of the community that adores it.” She noted the season was full of Black creative voices both on and offstage, and that two Broadway theaters were being renamed for the great Black performers James Earl Jones and Lena Horne. And she quipped that she sees the phrase “The Great White Way,” as Broadway has long been called, to be a nickname — “as opposed to a how-to guide.”

She received some backlash on social media after performing an original rap in honor of the female nominees at the Feb. 19 BAFTA Awards show in London. Her performance mixed a high-energy medley of Eurythmics‘ “Sisters Are Doin’ It for Themselves” and Sister Sledge’s “We Are Family” with a rap number that named-checked famous actors like Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Jamie Lee Curtis.

“I had a blast,” she said later.",0
384,"Syria, Saudi Arabia move toward restoring embassies, flights","BEIRUT (AP) — Syria and Saudi Arabia said Thursday they were moving toward reopening embassies and resuming flights between the two countries for the first time in more than a decade.

The joint statement followed a visit by Syria’s top diplomat to the kingdom, the first since Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic relations with Syria in 2012.

Syria was widely shunned by Arab governments over Syrian President Bashar Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters in a 2011 uprising that descended into civil war. The breakdown in relations culminated with Syria being ousted from the Arab League.

However, in recent years, as Assad consolidated control over most of the country, Syria’s neighbors have begun to take steps toward rapprochement. The overtures picked up pace since the massive Feb. 6 earthquake in Turkey and Syria, and the Chinese-brokered reestablishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had backed opposing sides in the Syrian conflict.

Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mikdad, at the invitation of Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, arrived in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for talks about bilateral relations, state media in the two countries reported. Saudi state media said Mikdad was received by the kingdom’s Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji.

The meeting focused on the steps needed to reach a “comprehensive political settlement of the Syrian crisis that would ... achieve national reconciliation, and contribute to the return of Syria to its Arab fold,” the joint statement said.

Saudi Arabia is hosting the next Arab League summit in May, when Syria’s membership is widely expected to be on the table. Some members, mainly Qatar, have opposed Damascus’ return to the organization.

Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, reiterated his country’s longstanding position in an interview with state TV late Thursday.

“There were reasons for suspending Syria’s membership in the Arab League and for participating in boycotts of the Syrian regime at that time, and those reasons still exist as far as we are concerned,” he said. “Our decision, as an individual state, has been to not take any steps (toward normalization) without political progress or a political solution to the Syrian crisis.”

But Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said she believes “prospects are high that Syria will be readmitted to the Arab League soon,” noting that even Qatar has softened its rhetoric.

“Even if several countries have expressed their opposition to normalization with Assad, it’s not likely that they would go against Riyadh and block Syria’s re-entry,” she said.

The Syrian and Saudi officials also discussed “enhancing security” and ″cooperation in combating drug smuggling and trafficking,” according to the statement. Syria is a primary producer of the amphetamine-based drug Captagon, which is largely smuggled into Gulf Arab markets for sale.

Syria may be hoping the rapprochement with a regional heavyweight will help end its political isolation, improve its flagging economy and potentially bring in reconstruction dollars. Meanwhile, incentives for Saudi Arabia to make a deal are less clear.

Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute, said Saudi Arabia — and specifically Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — may be looking for a way to rehabilitate the kingdom’s image. That image was tarnished by the kingdom’s involvement in the war in Yemen and by the 2018 slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to have been at the prince’s orders.

Brokering an Arab consensus on Syria, would feed into Prince Mohammed’s “desire to portray himself as a regional statesman” and “underline the Saudi ability to lead the region,” Ulrichsen said.

Jacobs said the kingdom’s rapprochement with Syria may be part of its strategy on Iran, which is “two-pronged and focused on both containment and diplomacy,” as opposed to the Trump administration’s maximum pressure approach.

As for Syria, Ulrichsen pointed out that U. S. sanctions on Damascus would still stand as an obstacle to any major investments in the Arab country, even with Syria normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia and its readmission to the Arab League.

Mikdad’s visit to Saudi Arabia came after Syria announced on Wednesday that it will reopen its embassy in Tunisia, which cut off relations in 2012. Tunisian President Kais Saied said earlier this month that he had directed the foreign ministry to appoint a new ambassador to Syria.

His move was reciprocated by the Syrian government, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.",0
385,Threats to dictionary publisher land man a year in prison,"A California man who made violent anti-LGBTQ-related threats against dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster Inc. over its updated gender definitions was sentenced Thursday to a year in prison.

The sentence imposed on Jeremy Hanson, 35, by a federal court in Massachusetts also included 30 days of home confinement, three years of probation and mental health treatment.

Hanson pleaded guilty last year to interstate transmission of threatening communications in connection with threats made to the Springfield, Massachusetts-based dictionary publisher and to the president of the University of North Texas.

In court documents, prosecutors said the Rossmoor, California, man has a history of making “threatening communications, nearly all of which were motivated by ... biases based upon race, gender, gender identity, and/or sexual orientation.”

Those other communications were directed at the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Land O’ Lakes Inc., Hasbro, a nonbinary rabbi and others, prosecutors said.

In a remote hearing Thursday, prosecutor Steven Breslow asked for an 18-month prison sentence, in part to serve as a deterrent to others at a time when violent rhetoric is becoming more common.

Hanson’s defense attorney, Marissa Elkins, asked that her client be sentenced to the time he has already served, citing his history of emotional and behavioral issues, including anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

More time behind bars could negatively affect his mental health, she said.

Judge Mark Mastroianni in U. S District Court in Springfield acknowledged Hanson’s medical history and said he had no intent or capacity to carry out his threats, but called his actions “disturbing and terrifying.”

He noted that Merriam-Webster management was “fearful that Hanson would come to their office and cause harm,” and said internal company communications referenced the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo offices in France, where terrorists killed 12 people who worked for the satirical weekly newspaper.

Hanson sent Merriam-Webster threatening messages and comments between Oct. 2 and Oct. 8, 2021 using the website’s “contact us” function, where he commented on word entries such as “girl,” “woman,” and “female,” prosecutors said.

“It is absolutely sickening that Merriam-Webster now tells blatant lies and promotes anti-science propaganda,” Hanson wrote, according to prosecutors. “There is no such thing as ‘gender identity.’ The imbecile who wrote this entry should be hunted down and shot.”

Twice he threatened to shoot and bomb company headquarters, prompting Merriam-Webster to close offices in Springfield and New York City for several days, prosecutors said.

Hanson also wrote an email to the president of the University of North Texas in 2022 that said “You ought to be shot in the head and have your offices set on fire,” for supporting transgender students, prosecutors said.

Hanson, who appeared at the hearing remotely from a California jail, declined to address the court when given the opportunity.",0
386,"Torrential storms batter South Florida, close key airport","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Nearly a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell in a matter of hours in Fort Lauderdale – causing widespread flooding, the closure of the city’s airport and the suspension of high-speed commuter rail service for the Broward County region.

The city of Fort Lauderdale released a statement Wednesday evening urging residents and visitors to stay off the roads until the water has subsided.

“Police and Fire Rescue continue to answer calls for service,” the statement said. “Public Works staff are clearing drains and operating pumps to mitigate the water as quickly as possible.”

The National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for Fort Lauderdale and other areas will run into pre-dawn hours Thursday as the chance of thunderstorms continued across the region, warning: “This is a life-threatening situation. Seek higher ground now!”

There have been no immediate reports of injuries or deaths.

Up to 14 inches had fallen across the area through Wednesday and the National Weather Service said another 2 to 4 inches were possible as a warm front continued to push northward, bringing a chance of thunderstorms.

Hollywood Mayor Josh Levy told CNN that the area already had seen days of rain. “The ground was already saturated so there is extensive flooding all over our city and throughout South Florida. Many roadways are impassable. Lots of vehicles got stuck and left abandoned in the middle of our roadways,” Levy said. “I’ve lived here my whole life. This is the most severe flooding that I’ve ever seen.”

More than 22,000 customers in Florida were without electricity Wednesday night, according to poweroutage.us.

All Broward County Public Schools with be closed Thursday, the district tweeted, adding “All afterschool activities, events, and extracurricular activities are also cancelled tomorrow.”

Wednesday’s relentless showers prompted the airport, one of the largest in the region, to suspend all arriving and departing flights, the airport tweeted around 4:15 p.m.

At around 5 p.m., the airport announced it shut down ground transportation shuttle service in response to recurring tornado warnings and ongoing heavy rainfall.

The main roadways entering and exiting the airport were flooded and impassable, the airport said around 5:15 p.m.

“Please do not attempt to enter or leave the airport at this time,” it warned.

It said airport operations would restart once the weather improves in the Fort Lauderdale area.

The heavy rains also prompted South Florida’s high-speed commuter rail service to shut down. Brightline posted on Twitter Wednesday evening that train service between Miami and Fort Lauderdale was suspended.

The National Weather Service in Miami declared a flash flood emergency around 8 p.m. Wednesday for Fort Lauderdale, along with the areas around Hollywood and Dania Beach. A short time later, forecasters issued a tornado warning for nearby Davie, Plantation and Lauderhill.

Video taken by witnesses showed water coming in the door at an airport terminal and a virtual river rushing down the tarmac between planes.

On Broward Boulevard, a man was seen swimming to the curb on the flooded street at rush hour as cars rolled by.

Drivers recorded themselves rolling through streets where brown, swirling water was up to the wheel wells or nearly to the hood of cars.",0
387,Novel treatment shows promise against rare cancer in kids,"A novel treatment using supercharged immune cells appears to work against tumors in children with a rare kind of cancer, researchers reported Wednesday.

Nine of 27 children in the Italian study had no sign of cancer six weeks after the treatment, although two later relapsed and died.

The treatment — called CAR-T cell therapy — is already used to help the immune system fight leukemia and other cancers in the blood. This is the first time researchers have achieved such encouraging results in solid tumors, experts in the field said, and raises hopes that it can be used against other kinds of cancers.

It’s too soon to call it a cure for neuroblastoma, a nerve tissue cancer that often starts in infancy in the adrenal glands near the kidneys in the abdomen.

Standard treatment can be intense, involving chemotherapy, surgery and radiation, depending on the cancer’s stage and other factors. The children in the study had cancers that had come back or were particularly hard to treat.

Eleven children were alive when the three-year study ended, including some who only partially responded to treatment and got repeat doses of the modified cells.

“Those kids were all destined to die without that therapy,” said University of Pennsylvania’s Dr. Carl June, a pioneer of CAR-T therapy who was not involved in the new research.

“No one’s ever had patients responding like this before, so we just don’t know what it’s going to look like a decade from now,” June said. “For sure, there are going to be more trials now based on these exciting results.”

CAR-T cell therapy harnesses the immune system to create “living drugs” able to seek and destroy tumors. T cells from the patient’s blood are collected and strengthened in the lab, then returned to the patient through an IV where they continue to multiply.

Six CAR-T cell therapies have been approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for blood cancers. Some early patients have been cured.

But success in solid tumors has been elusive. The latest study was done by researchers at the Vatican’s Bambino Gesu pediatric hospital in Rome.

“They seem to have found a unique combination” to get the modified cells to multiply initially, then last a long time to continue their cancer-killing work, said Dr. Robbie Majzner of Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new study.

Study co-author Dr. Franco Locatelli said they also added a safety switch to eliminate the cells if a patient had a severe reaction. When one patient had problems, they flipped the safety switch, showing that it worked, although later they determined the patient’s problem was caused by a brain bleed unrelated to the CAR-T cells.

Many of the children had a side effect that is common with CAR-T therapy — an immune overreaction called “cytokine release syndrome.” It can be serious, but was mild in most, the researchers reported.

They concluded that CAR-T therapy was “feasible and safe in treating high-risk neuroblastoma.”

388,FAA says it has sent 250 cases of unruly passengers to FBI,"Federal officials said Thursday they have referred more than 250 unruly airline passengers to the FBI for possible criminal prosecution since late 2021, including one as recently as last month, when a man tried to stab a flight attendant with a broken-off spoon.

The pace of the criminal referrals is slowing, however. The Federal Aviation Administration identified 17 cases it has sent to the FBI in the first three months of this year — mostly for incidents that happened last year but took time to investigate.

Airlines have reported fewer cases of unruly passengers since last April, when a federal judge struck down a requirement that people wear masks on planes and public transportation. Before that ruling, about two-thirds of all incidents on planes involved disputes over masks.

The FAA can levy civil fines but lacks authority to file criminal charges, so it asks the FBI to step in for the most serious cases.

“If you act out on a plane, you should just stay at home because we will come after you with serious consequences,” acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said in a statement. “We have zero tolerance for unruly behavior.”

The FBI did not say how often it acts on the FAA referrals. Assistant Director Luis Quesada said the bureau is “committed to investigating all incidents that fall within FBI jurisdiction aboard commercial flights,” but did not provide numbers.

The FAA announcement about came as lawmakers push legislation to create a new no-fly list for people convicted or fined for interfering with flight crews. A similar proposal backed by airline unions failed to gain ground last year in the face of opposition from conservatives and civil libertarians. The current FBI no-fly list is aimed at people suspected of terrorism ties.

The 17 cases that the FAA has referred this year include allegations of assaults against flight attendants and fellow passengers, attempts to open airplane exits during flights, and trying to break into the cockpit.

In the most recent case, passengers helped subdue a man who, prosecutors say, tried to open an emergency door and attempted to stab a flight attendant with a broken metal spoon during a flight from Los Angeles to Boston.",0
389,Lebanese judge lifts travel ban for central bank governor,"BEIRUT (AP) — A Lebanese judge on Thursday rescinded a travel ban she had placed on the country’s embattled central bank governor, clearing the way for him to travel to Paris for a scheduled hearing with French prosecutors next month.

Judge Ghada Aoun issued a travel ban against Riad Salameh in January 2022, against the backdrop of a lawsuit accusing him of embezzlement and dereliction of duty during the country’s financial meltdown.

The ban could have prevented Salameh from traveling to Paris to appear at a scheduled hearing on May 16 before French prosecutors, who have opened their own investigation into alleged money laundering involving the governor.

Aoun had told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she planned to rescind the ban. On Thursday, a judicial official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, confirmed that she rescinded the ban and that the General Security agency, responsible for border control, had been notified.

Salameh’s lawyer in France and a spokesperson for the Lebanese central bank did not immediately respond to inquiries as to whether Salameh had been notified that the travel ban was lifted and whether he would travel to France for the scheduled hearing.

A delegation of European investigators from France, Germany, and Luxembourg arrived in Beirut in January to interrogate Salameh and others from Lebanon’s financial and banking sector, some of them his close associates, in a money laundering investigation of some $330 million. The investigators are slated to return to Lebanon later this month.

In March last year, authorities in the three countries froze more than $130 million in assets linked to the investigation.

Salameh — who has been in office for nearly three decades, with his term set to expire in July — was once touted as the guardian of Lebanon’s monetary stability and praised for steering the country’s finances through post-war recovery and bouts of unrest. But he has come under intense scrutiny since the small Mediterranean nation’s economic meltdown began in late 2019, with many experts now questioning his monetary policies.

The Lebanese pound, which was for many years pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1,500 pounds to $1, now trades at close to 100,000 pounds for $1 on the black market, which is the operational exchange rate for conducting most business, while the official rate is set at 15,000 pounds to the dollar.",0
390,Challenge to Biden 'Cost of Carbon' policy dismissed,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A lawsuit that Louisiana and other Republican-leaning states filed challenging figures the Biden administration uses to calculate damages from greenhouse gasses was dismissed Wednesday by a federal appeals court.

The unanimous decision by three judges on the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans was the latest defeat for states challenging the Biden “cost of carbon” policy. It leaves the administration to continue using a damage cost estimate of about $51 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions as it develops environmental regulations. That estimate is under review by the administration and could increase.

The Biden cost estimate had been used during former President Barack Obama’s administration. President Joe Biden restored it on his first day in office after the administration of former President Donald Trump had reduced the figure to about $7 or less per ton.

A federal judge in Louisiana had ordered a halt to the administration’s approach early last year after the states filed a lawsuit. The states said the policy threatened to drive up energy costs while decreasing state revenues from energy production.

The 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans blocked the judge’s order and the Supreme Court declined to intervene.

On Thursday the appeals court dismissed the case, saying the challenging states had no standing to sue because they had not shown that the regulations caused the economic harms their lawsuit cited.

“Plaintiffs contemplate harms that are several steps removed from — and are not guaranteed by — the challenged Executive Order,” wrote Judge Jacques Wiener, appointed to the court by former President George H. W. Bush, on behalf of a panel that also included Obama appointee Stephen Higginson and Trump appointee Cory Wilson.

The $51 per ton estimate was established in 2016 and used to justify major rules such as the Clean Power Plan — former President Barack Obama’s signature effort to address climate change by tightening emissions standards from coal-fired power plants — and separate rules imposing tougher vehicle emission standards. However, the Clean Power Plan never took effect after being blocked by federal courts.

Now, the administration is reviewing the $51 per ton estimate. The Environmental Protection Agency in September proposed a cost roughly four times higher than the Obama figure.

Researchers have said for years that the damage done by every ton of carbon dioxide that comes out of a smokestack or tailpipe far exceeds $51. A study last year in the journal Nature concluded the price should be $185 per ton — 3.6 times higher than the U. S. standard.

A 2017 report from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said current carbon pricing calculations were inadequate. Researchers began calculating damages from carbon emissions in the 1980s and before 2017, the last updates to the modelling were in the early to mid 1990s.

The other states whose officials sued are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.

391,Bill would let parents 'opt out' of school mask mandates,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama lawmakers on Wednesday advanced legislation aimed at letting parents bypass requirements for students to wear face masks in school.

The House Health Committee approved the legislation that harkens back to disputes over public health orders during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill says parents of a student at a K-12 school have the right to “opt his or her child out” of any policy for students to wear a face covering at school, at a school function, on a school bus or at a school bus stop. The bill now moves to the full Alabama House of Representatives for debate.

“This is a parental rights bill,” Republican Rep. Chip Brown, the sponsor of the bill, told the committee. “It’s a bill that basically says, as a parent, that I should make the health decisions for my children, not the state.”

Alabama had a statewide mask requirement during the pandemic, but the order expired on April 9, 2021, and the decision then was left to local school officials. Mask requirements have largely gone by the wayside as COVID-19 case numbers fell. And legal battles have played out in Florida and other states over who has the authority to ban mask mandates in schools.

Democratic Rep. Pebblin Warren questioned the impact on other children and their families if a child without a mask spread an illness.

“I’m just trying to be fair to all the parents. If my child gets sick because your child carried a virus, what rights do I have to deal with that situation?” Warren said.

Bart Reeves, assistant executive director of the Alabama Association of School Boards, said the bill would strip decision-making authority from local school officials who were either elected or appointed by elected officials.

“This sends a concerning message to our communities that individual preferences can override the collective decisions made through the democratic process,” Reeves said during a public hearing on the bill.

The co-founder of a group that opposed mask and vaccine mandates spoke in favor of the bill during the public hearing.

“During the last few years we saw the rights of parents obliterated through the forced masking of their children,” Kaycee Cavender told the committee.",0
392,Florida executes 'ninja killer' for couple's 1989 death,"STARKE, Fla. (AP) — Florida executed a man known as the “ninja killer” on Wednesday for the 1989 slayings of a couple visiting the state from New Jersey.

Louis Bernard Gaskin, 56, was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. after receiving a lethal injection, the governor’s office said. He was convicted of killing Robert Sturmfels, 56, and Georgette Sturmfels, 55, on Dec. 20, 1989, in their Flagler County winter home on Florida’s northeastern coast.

Gaskin woke up at 4:45 a.m. Wednesday and had his last meal at 9:45 a.m., Department of Corrections spokesperson Kayla McLaughlin Smith said during a news conference. The meal included BBQ pork ribs, pork and turkey neck, Buffalo wings, shrimp fried rice, french fries and water.

Gaskin was visited by his sister Wednesday, but he did not meet with a spiritual adviser, McLaughlin Smith said. No relatives of the victims had arranged to be in the witness room during the execution, which was scheduled for 6 p.m. and started without delay.

When asked if he had any final statement, Gaskin said: “Justice is not about the crime. It’s not about the criminal. It’s about the law.”

He then referred to the legal proceedings surrounding his case and the appeals and finished his statement saying, “Look at my case.”

Gaskin began receiving the lethal cocktail of drugs at 6:02 p.m., causing him to breathe heavily as his chest rose and fell under a white sheet. The prison’s warden went to check on whether Gaskin was still conscious at 6:05 p.m. He didn’t respond. Gaskin’s breathing appeared to stop at 6:07 p.m. A doctor entered the death chamber at 6:14 p.m. to examine Gaskin and declared him dead a minute later.

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has been signing death warrants at a rapid pace this year as he prepares his widely expected presidential campaign. He oversaw only two executions in his first four years in office, both in 2019.

Gaskin’s execution came six weeks after Donald Dillbeck, 59, was put to death for the 1990 murder of Faye Vann, 44, in Tallahassee, and three weeks before the scheduled execution of Darryl B. Barwick for slaying Rebecca Wendt, 24, in 1986 in Panama City.

Barring any stays for Barwick, it will be the shortest period that three executions have been carried out in Florida since three were put to death within 36 days in 2014 under former Gov. Rick Scott, also a Republican.

Gaskin’s death marked the state’s 101st execution since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. There are an additional 297 people on Florida’s death row, which is located at Florida State Prison, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Jacksonville.

Gaskin, who was dubbed the “ninja killer” because he wore all-black ninja clothing during the crimes, shot his victims with a .22-caliber rifle, investigators said. He was convicted of first-degree murder.

Property that he stole from the Sturmfels’ home — a clock, two lamps and a videocassette recorder — was found at his residence and were intended to be Christmas gifts for his girlfriend, according to investigators. He was also convicted of armed robbery, burglary and the attempted murder that same night of another couple who lived nearby.

Local media reported at the time that Gaskin quickly confessed to the crimes and told a psychologist before his trial that he knew what he was doing.

“The guilt was always there,” Gaskin said. “The devil had more of a hold than God did. I knew that I was wrong. I wasn’t insane.”

Jurors voted 8-4 in 1990 to recommend the death sentence, which the judge accepted. Florida law now requires a unanimous jury vote for capital punishment, although the Legislature could send DeSantis a bill this week that would allow 8-4 jury recommendations for capital punishment.

The state and U. S. supreme courts rejected appeals Gaskin filed since his death warrant was signed. The latest denial came Tuesday.

393,India’s push for 24/7 clean energy from dams upends lives,"KINNAUR, India (AP) — The pickup truck jostled away from the roaring Sutlej River and up the steep mountain path flanked by snow-capped Himalayan peaks, some nearly 7,000 meters (22,965 feet) high. The nine passengers, farmers-turned-activists campaigning to prevent more dams from being built, were traveling to the remote Kandar hamlet in India’s Kinnaur district.

The few-dozen Indigenous residents were forced to relocate after falling boulders destroyed most of their previous homes in 2005. And villagers believe tunneling for dams was to blame, although authorities deny it.

Indigenous activists like Buddha Sain Negi, 30, went there to learn more about the continued struggles faced by Kandar. Sitting atop a steep slope overlooking a 19-year-old dam, the activists heard residents speak of ways India’s hydroelectric push had upended their lives and led to nearly two decades of protest. Some families took shelter in sheds, and more lives were lost because of falling boulders before they got compensation to build new homes, although it wasn’t enough to mend livelihoods.

For villagers like Raj Kumari, 48, the fear of that night remains. The farmer said her husband was out when the boulders began rolling down. “My daughter said that we’ll get left behind and die, and only her father would survive,” she said.

A favorite initiative of Indian governments, the push for dams has skyrocketed as the nation looks for round-the-clock energy that doesn’t spew planet-warming emissions. Hydropower commonly is produced when fast-moving water spins turbines to generate electricity.

But natural water systems have been altered by dams in this region that receives little rainfall, and farmers are struggling to irrigate their orchards. Spring waters from melting glaciers they’ve historically relied on also are drying up with climate change.

Farmers found themselves turned into activists fighting against more dams, with thousands protesting last August after a fatal landslide in the district. Carving mountains to build tunnels that funnel river water has made deadly landslides more common — a risk scientists and locals have flagged, although authorities say they take precautions.

India’s federal ministries for renewable energy and environment didn’t respond to an email request for comment.

“This is a fight for our survival,” said Buddha Sain Negi, the activist-farmer.

Dam opponents point to other impacts: Thousands of trees, including the rare Chilgoza pine whose nuts are prized and provide valuable income for local communities, are being cut to make way for construction. The Sutlej River is now dry in patches, meaning some families struggle to immerse the ashes of cremated loved ones. And some residents fear thousands of migrant workers, coming to work on the dam, could overwhelm them.

The district, home to around 100,000 people, already produces 4,000 megawatts of clean energy — the equivalent of four nuclear power plants, said Jiya Lal, a farmer who is part of an advocacy group for environmental justice in the mountains. He said locals here have been asked in the “national interest” to reconsider their objection to dams. He asked a question echoed across the Himalayas: “How much more can be demanded of us?”

The federal government aims to increase India’s electricity output from dams to 70,000 megawatts by 2030 — an increase of 50% that could account for 8.5% of India’s entire capacity. It also wants to add 18,800 megawatts of pumped-storage dams, which act as giant batteries that store energy by pumping water from one reservoir to another that’s elevated then releasing it through turbines to produce power.

Only China and the U. S. have more dams than India’s over 4,400. The country hopes dams can help solve the clean energy puzzle: How to keep the grid running on renewables when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that electricity generated by dams in Himachal Pradesh state would generate profits and jobs. “The wealth of water and forest in tribal areas is priceless,” he said in October.

But recent disasters, including a holy town sinking in January, have resulted in “question marks” over the focus on dams as a way of ensuring round-the-clock clean power, said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

About a tenth of India’s power comes from the sun or wind, and large dams provide the “backbone” by allowing it to balance the grid when there are sharp changes in demand, said Ammu Susana Jacob, a scientist at the think tank Center of Study of Science, Technology and Policy.

To wean itself off dirty fuels and meet its 2030 goals, India needs to increase its energy storage capacity to 41 gigawatts, according to government estimates.

Bhanu Pratap Singh, director of the hydropower company Shree Bhavani Power Project, rued that dams hadn’t received the same kind of governmental boosts that solar or wind had, but said this was changing.

Delays due to legal challenges of getting land meant that private companies were less keen to build large dams, Singh said. And with rising concerns about the risks of building dams in the fragile mountains, he said that those opposing dams and those building dams needed to be in “consistent and transparent dialogue”.

While dams, unlike battery storage, aren’t reliant on expensive imports, they are still costly. Land needed to build them is scarce, and communities are often displaced. Cascading environmental impacts trigger local protests, like the one in Kinnaur, which add to costs. This helps make hydropower more expensive than solar or wind in India.

With global battery prices plummeting since 2017 and likely to get cheaper, India is faced with the “tricky” question of whether it makes sense to lock billions of dollars into new dams when other technologies are getting more viable, said Rahul Walawalkar, who heads the India Energy Storage Alliance, an industry group.

The sheer scale of India’s energy transition — demand for electricity will grow more than anywhere else in the next 20 years — means there are limited options if the country wants to restrict imports. “It’s a necessary risk,” Walawalkar said.

In Kinnaur, the costs of India’s answer to this question looms large for Shanta Kumar Negi, a local politician who says people in the higher reaches of the mountains buy water to irrigate fields, with dams exacerbating the water crisis triggered by global warming.

“If I don’t fight to stop the wrong being done to us — how will I answer my children?” he asked.

Experts say the ongoing protests in Kinnaur and elsewhere underline the risks of pushing dams without thinking through potential impacts on the environment and the resulting financial costs. In 2019, at least 37 dams were delayed, and there were another 41 where construction hadn’t begun for reasons ranging from financial problems to protests, according to a parliamentary report.

Signs of tensions over dam construction are visible on the national highway in Kinnaur: There are warnings about loose boulders on mountain walls, and ancient trees are painted with red crosses marking them for felling.

The situation reflects India’s “siloed approach” to building big projects, such as dams, that don’t take into account climate realities, said Abinash Mohanty, who heads climate change and sustainability at the global development organization IPE Global. The Himalayas are a more fragile ecosystem than others, disrupted by climate extremes and intense human activities — yet whether the environment had reached its tipping point wasn’t taken into account.

Mohanty compared it to people trying to lift heavier weights than they can handle. “You’ll either hurt yourself or drop it,” he said.

Climate change is exacerbating threats. Over a fifth of 177 dams built close to Himalayan glaciers could be at risk of flooding if glacial lakes burst, according to a 2016 study. Five years later, a flood made worse by melting glaciers smashed two dams, killing at least 31 people.

Even some dams listed in government documents as designed to pump water to help store power aren’t actually doing so. A 25-year-old dam in Gujarat doesn’t pump water because of an engineering issue, while a second reservoir is still being built for another 17-year-old dam, according to the India Energy Storage Alliance.

India has drafted guidelines for boosting use of pumped-storage dams that suggest doing away with environmental assessments and public hearings for some projects.

But Walawalkar of the industry alliance said governments need to be careful about choosing the right locations to build dams. “Blanket environmental clearances could be a double-edged sword,” he said.

394,Members of Congress on TikTok defend app's reach to voters,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Jeff Jackson of North Carolina has used it to explain the complex fight over raising the debt limit. Rep. Robert Garcia of California has used it to engage with members of the LGBTQ+ community. And Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania has used it to give an overview of Election Day results.

As pressure against TikTok mounts in Washington, the more than two dozen members of Congress — all Democrats — who are active on the social media platform are being pushed by their colleagues to stop using it. Many defend their presence on the platform, saying they have a responsibility as public officials to meet Americans where they are — and more than 150 million are on TikTok.

“I’m sensitive to the ban and recognize some of the security implications. But there is no more robust and expeditious way to reach young people in the United States of America than TikTok,” Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota told The Associated Press.

Yet the lawmakers active on TikTok remain a distinct minority. Most in Congress are in favor of limiting the app, forcing a sale to remove connections to China or even banning it outright. The U. S. armed forces and more than half of U.S. states have already banned the app from official devices, as has the federal government. Similar bans have been imposed in Denmark, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand, as well as the European Union.

Criticism of TikTok reached a new level last week as CEO Shou Zi Chew testified for more than six hours at a contentious hearing in the House. Lawmakers grilled Chew about the implications of the app for America’s national security and the effect on the mental health of its users. And the tough questions came from both sides of the aisle, as Republicans and Democrats alike pressed Chew about TikTok’s content moderation practices, its ability to shield American data from Beijing and its spying on journalists.

“I’ve got to hand it to you,” said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, as members questioned Chew over data security and harmful content. “You’ve actually done something that in the last three to four years has not happened except for the exception of maybe (Russian President) Vladimir Putin. You have unified Republicans and Democrats.”

While the hearing made plain that lawmakers view TikTok as a threat, their lack of first-hand experience with the app was apparent at times. Some made inaccurate and head-scratching comments, seemingly not understanding how TikTok connects to a home Wi-Fi router or how it moderates illicit content.

Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., who is active on the app and opposes a nationwide ban, called the hearing “cringeworthy.”

“It was just so painful to watch,” he told the AP on Friday. “And it just shows the real problem is Congress doesn’t have a lot of expertise, whether it be social media or, for that matter, more importantly, technology.”

Garcia, who said he uses TikTok more as a consumer, said most of his colleagues who are proposing a nationwide ban told him they had never used the app. “It gets hard to understand if you’re not actually on it,” the freshman Democrat said. “And at the end of the day, a lot of TikTok is harmless people dancing and funny videos.”

“It’s also incredibly rich educational content, and learning how to bake and learning about the political process,” he said.

Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N. Y., who has more than 180,000 followers on the app, held a news conference with TikTok influencers before the hearing. He accused Republicans of pushing a ban on TikTok for political reasons.

“There are 150 million people on TikTok and we are more connected to them than Republicans are,” Bowman said. “So for them, it’s all about fear-mongering and power. It’s not TikTok, because, again, we’ve looked the other way and allowed Facebook and other platforms to do similar things.”

Critics of TikTok in Congress say their opposition is rooted in national security, not politics. TikTok is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd., which appoints its executives. They worry Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over TikTok data on American users, effectively turning the app into a data-mining operation for a foreign power. The company insists it is taking steps to make sure that can never happen.

“The basic approach that we’re following is to make it physically impossible for any government, including the Chinese government, to get access to U. S. user data,” general counsel Erich Andersen said during an interview with the AP on Friday at a cybersecurity conference in California.

TikTok has been emphasizing a $1.5 billion proposal to store all U. S. user data on servers owned and maintained by the software giant Oracle. Access to U.S. data would be managed by U.S. employees through a separate entity run independently of ByteDance and monitored by outside observers.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina took the unusual step of releasing a public statement urging all members of Congress to stop using TikTok, including from his home state — seemingly a jab at Jackson, who is one of the more active members with more than 1.8 million followers.

“I was just saying if we’re having a discussion about TikTok then I think we ought to at least reduce the pull factor by elected officials who can simply come off of it,” Tillis said this week, when asked about his statement. “I don’t have a TikTok account. So that was an easy separation for me.”

Loud warnings about TikTok have also been coming from President Joe Biden’s administration. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and FBI Director Christopher Wray have told Congress in recent weeks that TikTok is a national security threat. Blinken told lawmakers the threat “should be ended one way or another.”

But some members are unconvinced.

“It’s like turning your cell phone off on an airplane. You’re supposed to do. And if it was super dangerous, I don’t think we will be allowed to have the phone on the plane,” Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, said Wednesday, “So if it was super dangerous for members of Congress to have this app on their phone, you have to imagine the administration or our government would say absolutely not.”

He added, “You can’t have it on a government phone, and that’s good.”

Concerns about what kind of content Americans encounter online, or how their data is collected by technology companies, also aren’t new. Congress has been wanting to curtail the amount of data tech companies collect on consumers through a national privacy law, but those efforts have stalled repeatedly over the years.

Supporters of TikTok on Capitol Hill are urging their colleagues to educate themselves about social media as a whole so Congress can pass legislation that deals with broader issues of data privacy, instead of hyper-focusing on a ban of TikTok, which could risk political backlash and a court fight over the reach of the First Amendment.

“We are uninformed and misinformed. We don’t even understand how social media works. We don’t know anything about data brokers and how data brokers sell our data to foreign countries and foreign companies right now,” Bowman said. “So ban TikTok tomorrow, this stuff is still going to be happening.”

395,NCAA lifts restrictions on athletes' official visits,"Prospects no longer will have limits on the number of schools they can officially visit during their college selection process.

The NCAA announced Thursday that its Division I Council approved the policy change that will take effect on July 1. Prospects previously could make official visits to five schools. Official visits are defined as visits that are paid for by the college.

Prospects can make one official visit to each school, unless that program has a head coaching change. In that case, a prospect could make a second official visit to the same school.

In men’s basketball, prospects will be permitted to make two official visits to the same school, as long as the visits don’t occur in the same academic year.

“For young people considering where to go to college, visits to campus — both official and unofficial — are an integral part of the decision-making process,” Lynda Tealer, executive associate athletics director at Florida and chair of the Division I Council, said in a statement. “This was an opportunity to modernize NCAA rules in a way that provides greater and more meaningful opportunities for prospects going through the recruitment process.”

Official visits can’t last longer than a two-night stay. Schools are allowed to pay for transportation, meals and what the NCAA defines as “reasonable entertainment” for up to two family members accompanying the prospect on that visit. ___",0
396,"Yankees INFs LeMahieu, Torres dealing with leg injuries","CLEVELAND (AP) — New York Yankees infielders DJ LeMahieu and Gleyber Torres are dealing with leg injuries that kept them out of Wednesday’s starting lineup for the series finale against the Cleveland Guardians.

LeMahieu’s quadriceps tightened Tuesday night while he was running the bases in New York’s 11-2 win and Torres was pulled in the ninth inning with a hip flexor.

Yankees manager Aaron Boone doesn’t think either injury is serious, but he’s not taking any chances. He characterized LeMahieu’s injury as day to day and said both he and Torres could be options off the bench in Wednesday’s game.

Boone said there are no plans for LeMahieu to undergo testing. Boone doesn’t think the quad injury is related to the 34-year-old compensating for a chronic toe condition he’s dealt with for a few seasons.

Boone said LeMahieu’s quad tightened while he was running the bases during the middle innings. LeMahieu reached base three times, scored twice and finished the game. Boone intended to play him Wednesday before LeMahieu reported lingering tightness.

“It’s not something we want to mess with,” Boone said.

A three-time All-Star, LeMahieu led the AL in batting in 2020 with a .364 average.

Torres went 1 for 4 with walk on Tuesday, leaving the game for a pinch runner after a ninth-inning single.

With LeMahieu and Torres out, rookie shortstop Anthony Volpe is batting leadoff for the first time. The 21-year-old Volpe has gotten off to a slow start, batting just .129 (4 for 31) with 12 strikeouts.",0
397,French investigative site claims Depardieu groped extras,"PARIS (AP) — A French investigative news website claims that actor Gérard Depardieu has been accused of harassing, groping or sexually assaulting 13 young women, mainly extras.

Most of the claims reported by the Mediapart website relate to film shoots between 2004 and 2022.

None of the women has filed a complaint. Depardieu himself has denied any criminal behavior.

Depardieu, 74, is among France’s most well-known stars. He was placed under investigation in December 2020 for rape and sexual assault, reportedly at his Paris home, following claims by an actress in 2018. The investigation is ongoing.

Mediapart, which is regarded as a reliable website, published the accusations in an article on Tuesday. They feed into the long-standing stereotype of an industry full of dirty secrets where silence is golden.

The incidents allegedly took place in public places, mainly on film sets.

In a Manhattan cabaret for the filming of the 2015 movie “Big House,” Depardieu allegedly tried to fondle three non-French extras. One of them, then aged 24, recounted to Mediapart, “I felt his fingers trying to slip in to get to my knickers.”

The wardrobe assistant for the 2015 movie “Big House,” Isabel Butel, told Mediapart of her shock at the reaction on set. “It was kind of ‘Oh that’s Gérard, he’s a bit mischievous!’” she was quoted as saying.

Another extra, identified as Hélène Darras, then 26, went to the police last year, 14 years after Depardieu allegedly kept grabbing her buttocks during filming of the 2008 comedy “Disco.” Darras stayed silent at the time, not wanting to “make an enemy of casting directors.” She eventually gave her account to police because “the film world is full of Gérards and we have to speak up,” she said.

Those interviewed, be they actresses, location assistants or others, said they complained about Depardieu’s vulgar remarks, groans and straying hands but drew only silence, or laughs, from others.

“People are afraid,” Mediapart quoted one casting director as saying. She said her colleagues and friends unanimously reacted to her decision to talk to Mediapart by saying, “Are you crazy?”

Lawyers for Depardieu, from the law firm Temime, “formally deny all allegations that (could) concern criminal law,” Mediapart wrote, and called the allegations a “veritable indictment” to which the actor has no intention of responding.

Depardieu, who has appeared in 200 films over six decades, is one of only a few French actors who have made a name for themselves in Hollywood. He won a Golden Globe for his performance in “Green Card,” a 1990 English-language romantic comedy co-starring Andie MacDowell.

Depardieu’s first big hit in France was “Les Valseuses,” (“Going Places”), Bertrand Blier’s classic farce about two wandering thugs.

Before crossing the Atlantic to star in “Green Card,” Depardieu played an array of roles, ranging from Jean Valjean, the thief-turned-saint in “Les Misérables,” to Christopher Columbus.

In 2014, he played the leading role in “Welcome to New York,” the film inspired by the life of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former director of the International Monetary Fund who was accused in 2011 of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. The charges against Strauss-Kahn were later dropped.",0
398,Indiana Senate GOP not supporting school voucher expansion,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A major expansion proposed for Indiana’s private school voucher program would be axed under the state budget plan advanced Thursday by state Senate Republicans.

That voucher expansion supported by House Republicans will be among several points of contentions as House and Senate budget leaders work to reach an agreement on a new two-year state budget before the end of April.

The Senate GOP plan also drops a House push to speed up planned cuts to the state’s personal income tax rates that were approved last year.

Senate Republicans proposed increasing general K-12 school funding by about 4.6% in each of the next two years. That $1.1 billion boost is less than the House endorsed in February, but House Republicans would direct more than $500 million to the voucher program expansion, or nearly one-third of their total proposed school funding increase.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ryan Mishler said the Senate proposal would keep the current family income limits to qualify for state money toward private school tuition.

The House plan centers on raising the family income limit from the current 300% of income eligibility for the federal free or reduced-price meals program to a 400% cap. That would boost the income limit for a family of four from the current $154,000 to $220,000. It would also continue a major program expansion that Republican lawmakers started in 2021 by raising that family size’s maximum income for a full voucher payment from the $48,000 cap previously in place.

The broader eligibility provisions were projected to grow the voucher program from the current 53,500 students to some 95,000 students in two years— and nearly double the state money spent on the program.

That higher cost is the Senate’s top concern, said Mishler, a Republican from Mishawaka.

“I don’t think there’s an issue whether we have vouchers or not, I mean we’re fine with that,” Mishler said. “I think we just have to figure out is it the 300% or the 400%, what should the eligibility be?”

Several hundred teachers attended a Statehouse rally on Thursday calling for increased school funding, and their cheers and chants could be heard inside a meeting room as the Senate committee voted to endorse the budget plan outlined by Mishler.

The state’s teachers’ unions and other public school organizations have opposed the voucher expansion, arguing that it drains money from traditional public schools and hurts efforts to boost Indiana’s lagging teacher pay.

“Ninety-plus percent of all Hoosier families send their students to our traditional public schools and we have to make sure that they’re funded properly,” Indiana State Teachers Association President Keith Gambill said. “With the cost-of-living changes that have occurred the past couple of years, we’re going to have people going backwards if we’re not careful.”

Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said he would continue pushing for the expansion proposal, arguing that more families in the state should be eligible for the voucher payments.

“They’re paying income taxes, they’re paying property taxes, I mean, they’re paying all these taxes and we just think it’s appropriate,” Huston said.

The Senate plan also includes a request from Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb to eliminate school material and textbook rental fees charged to families — a step estimated to cost about $120 million a year. School organizations had opposed the House proposal that prohibited charging those fees but did not provide specific funding to school districts for covering that cost.

Indiana is among a handful of states still allowing such textbook fees, which Democrats and many education advocates have long criticized as an unfair extra cost to families.

Senate Republicans continue resisting the House GOP push for speeding up individual income tax rate cuts approved a year ago. Under the House plan, current rate of 3.15% would go to 3.0% next year and 2.9% in 2026 — three years earlier than currently scheduled.

While House Republican budget leaders say they believe state tax collections have remained solid enough to move up the rate cuts, Mishler said he wanted to, instead, direct more money toward paying off future teacher pension obligations that now cost the state about $1 billion a year.

“If we pay that down, that’s a billion dollars a year,” Mishler said. “I think it gives us flexibility for something more transformational.”",0
399,Scientists challenge US wildlife director's qualifications,"ALBUQUERQUE, N. M. (AP) — Dozens of scientists from universities and environmental groups are pushing for the removal of the head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, claiming she lacks the educational background required to run the agency despite securing Senate confirmation last year.

The concerns over the credentials of service Director Martha Williams were outlined in a letter from 100 scientists sent Wednesday to President Joe Biden and U. S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.

Williams is an attorney who majored in philosophy, and her critics claim she does not have the science-based education that federal law says is required for the position. Government attorneys have rejected allegations she’s not credentialed, but they have not disputed her lack of a science degree.

There was no discussion of Williams’ educational qualifications during her Senate confirmation hearing. She was confirmed on a voice vote in February 2022 with bipartisan support.

She worked as an attorney at the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks for more than two decades, then led the state agency for three years before being named principal deputy director at the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service following Biden’s election. During the Obama administration, she was a deputy solicitor at the Interior Department for two years.

The call for her resignation or dismissal comes as Biden faces growing pressure from some wildlife advocates who contend the administration has not done enough to protect endangered plants and animals from extinction.

Many of the scientists named in the letter also have been involved in efforts to retain federal protections for threatened grizzly bears in Western states and gray wolves across most of the nation.

Williams came to the Biden administration from Montana, where hunting wolves is legal. She said during her confirmation hearing that the grizzly bear population around Yellowstone National Park has recovered, putting her at odds with wildlife advocates.

The battle over her qualifications has simmered since she was announced as Biden’s pick in late 2021. The Interior Department’s solicitor and inspector general dismissed complaints over the matter, but still pending in federal court is a lawsuit that focuses on the educational requirements outlined by Congress when it overhauled the wildlife agency in 1974.

Federal law says only someone with “scientific education and experience” can be appointed director of the service.

Williams has a bachelor’s in philosophy from the University of Virginia and a law degree from the University of Montana, according to congressional records and the Department of Interior.

The Fish and Wildlife Service did not respond to multiple emails about her qualifications. Interior spokesperson Melissa Schwartz declined to comment on the letter, and the White House did not respond.

Attorneys for the Biden administration said in court filings that the law requires Williams’ education to be considered “cumulatively” with her experience.

“She clearly has the requisite background,” they wrote.

A spokesperson for Montana Sen. Steve Daines said Wednesday that the Republican lawmaker stood by his vote for Williams.

Montana U. S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, said that since her confirmation, Williams “has brought collaborative, science-based solutions to the tough problems facing our wildlife and public lands.”

Other than resigning or being fired by the president, impeachment is the only mechanism for removing Senate-confirmed civil officers such as Williams, according to Katherine Scott, associate historian in the U. S. Senate Historical Office.

The scientists calling for her ouster say they’re concerned the administration is setting a precedent by sidestepping the scientific education requirement.

They claim Williams is serving in contradiction to the administration’s own policies and ethics rules. They pointed to an assessment done by Biden’s Scientific Integrity Task Force that suggests executive branch positions should be filled by candidates with appropriate credentials and that violations of scientific integrity policies should be taken as seriously as violations of ethics rules.

The scientists include Dave Parsons, who led government efforts to reintroduce the endangered Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest; two board members and a scientist with Silver Spring, Maryland-based Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility; well-known biology professors Paul and Anne Ehrlich at Stanford University; and wolf experts William Ripple and Robert Beschta from Oregon State University.

With the exception of Williams, every director since the agency was overhauled in the 1970s had a scientific education, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.

“I see this appointment as a tipping point, where politics will forever override statutory credentials,” said Parsons, who authored the letter.

In the lawsuit challenging her confirmation, Illinois lawyer Robert Aland claimed decisions made by Williams would be “contaminated” since she was appointed illegally. Wildlife “could suffer the most serious adverse consequences” as a result, he said.

A judge dismissed the case over jurisdictional issues and did not address the dispute over education. Aland has appealed.

Aland previously sued the agency over its attempts to lift protections for grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region of Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Federal judges restored protections in both instances, but a new proposal to lift protections is under consideration by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The agency is planning a new rule that could lift protections for gray wolves in early 2024.

Some of the scientists in Wednesday’s letter said the decisions on bears and wolves are up to Williams. They said her qualifications could be used as an argument in future litigation over the species.

Williams is not the first to have her qualifications questioned. Under former President Donald Trump, political appointee Greg Sheehan oversaw Fish and Wildlife for more than a year as the agency’s deputy director at a time when no director was in place.

Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke unsuccessfully sought to make Sheehan acting director, but government officials said he did not have the science degree required for the position under federal law. Sheehan stepped down in 2018 and was never formally nominated.

Before Trump nominee Aurelia Skipwith was confirmed for the post in 2019, environmental groups objected in part because she had studied molecular biology and not wildlife specifically. The Center for Biological Diversity called her an “industry shill” because of Skipwith’s past work with the chemical company Monsanto.

Center for Biological Diversity government affairs director Brett Hartl said the group knew about Williams’ lack of a degree, but decided nevertheless to support her.

He said his group believed having “an outside person” serve as director would offer a better opportunity to solve deep cultural issues that have plagued the agency over the years. Hartl agreed that the law requires a science degree but said the Senate has the ultimate authority to decide who’s qualified.

Despite the early support for Williams, Hartl said his group has been disappointed with the Biden administration’s failure to replace a Trump-era rule that weakened protections for many species.

“To me, that’s the stuff she should be evaluated on,” he said. “We’ve been fairly underwhelmed thus far at her tenure.”",0
400,2 ex-LA sheriff's deputies face federal civil rights charges,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two former Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies are accused of violating the civil rights of a skateboarder in 2020 and perpetrating a coverup, federal prosecutors said Thursday.

A grand jury handed down the indictment last month, and both ex-deputies surrendered to authorities Thursday when it was unsealed.

Miguel Vega and Christopher Hernandez are accused of throwing the skateboarder — identified as “J. A.” in court papers — in the back of their cruiser and detaining him without cause in 2020 in Compton. He was still in the patrol vehicle when they then engaged in a pursuit and crashed the car, injuring the skateboarder. Prosecutors say the duo then conspired to coverup the then-23-year-old man’s unlawful detention.

Vega, 32, and Hernandez, 37, are charged with conspiracy, deprivation of rights under color of law, witness tampering and falsification of records. Vega is charged with another falsification of records count. Their attorneys did not respond to an emailed request for comment Thursday.

The same ex-deputies were involved in the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old man later that year during a foot chase. Authorities say Vega shot Andres Guardadofive times in the back after the deputies chased him on foot. Guardado’s killing sparked protests, and his family settled a lawsuit with the county for $8 million.

The federal indictment was first reported Thursday by the Los Angeles Times. Vega and Hernandez are scheduled to be arraigned Thursday afternoon.

The deputies remained on active duty until December 2020, the LA Times reported.

“The indictment alleges that these two deputies violated a young person’s constitutional rights by willfully and illegally detaining him without just cause,” U. S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a news release. “Officers who abuse their power must be held accountable, and my Office is committed to prosecuting violations of civil rights by those who violate their oaths and victimize those who they were sworn to protect.”

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department did not immediately have a comment after the indictment was unsealed.

On April 13, 2020, Vega and Hernandez approached two young Black men outside a Compton skatepark. J. A., who was inside the enclosed park, yelled at the deputies to leave the men alone.

The deputies pulled J. A. through an opening in the fence and threw him into the back of the cruiser, prosecutors said.

“Vega and Hernandez did not handcuff J. A., did not secure J.A.’s seatbelt, did not tell J.A. that J.A. was under arrest, and did not inform J.A. of J.A.’s rights at any time,” according to the indictment.

Vega, the driver, told J. A. that they would drop him off in gang territory as Hernandez, from the passenger seat, told the skateboarder that he’d be beaten, prosecutors said. Then Vega — with J.A. still in the backseat — began pursuing a bicyclist down an alley, where the deputy crashed the vehicle.

J. A. suffered a cut above his right eye in the collision, according to the indictment. Vega pulled him out of the cruiser and told him to leave, but the deputy later reported that a suspect with a gun — describing J.A.’s clothes — had fled the area. Neither deputy said the skateboarder had been inside the patrol vehicle during the crash.

Vega then told a sergeant that J. A. was suspected of being under the influence of a controlled substance, prosecutors said. They said Hernandez later directed another deputy to write him a citation for being under the influence of methamphetamine after J.A. was taken to the hospital for his cut.

Prosecutors also allege that Vega and Hernandez falsified incident reports later in the month, inaccurately claiming, among other things, that J. A. had threatened to harm people in the skatepark.",0
401,Virgin Orbit seeks bankruptcy protection after mission fail,"Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after a failed mission this year and increasing difficulty in raising funding for future missions.

The company laid off most of its staff on Friday and told the U. S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in a filing Tuesday that it was looking to sell its assets.

Virgin Orbit said that it has secured $31.6 million in debtor-in-possession financing from Branson’s Virgin Investments Ltd.

Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said that once the financing is approved by the bankruptcy court, the funds are expected to provide Virgin Orbit with the necessary liquidity to continue operating as it attempts to sell the company.

“While we have taken great efforts to address our financial position and secure additional financing, we ultimately must do what is best for the business,” Hart said.

The Long Beach, California, company said in its bankruptcy filing that it has between 200 and 999 estimated creditors. It had approximately $243 million in total assets and $153.5 million in total liabilities as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.

Last week Virgin Orbit said that it was cutting 675 jobs, about 85% of its workforce. Shortly before the announcement, the company said that it was pausing all operations amid reports of possible job cuts. At the time Virgin Orbit confirmed that it was putting all work on hold, but didn’t say for how long.

In January, a mission by Virgin Orbit to launch the first satellites into orbit from Europe failed after a rocket’s upper stage prematurely shut down. It was a setback in the United Kingdom which had hoped that the launch from Cornwall in southwest England would mark the beginning of more commercial opportunities for the U. K. space industry.

The company said in February that an investigation found that its rocket’s fuel filter had become dislodged, causing an engine to become overheated and other components to malfunction over the Atlantic Ocean.

Virgin Orbit, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, was founded in 2017 by British billionaire Branson to target the market for launching small satellites into space. Its LauncherOne rockets are launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes, allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using fixed launch sites.

Shares of Virgin Orbit Holdings Inc., which traded above $10 about two years ago, tumbled 24% before the opening bell Tuesday, to about 15 cents.",0
402,"Met premieres Blanchard's `Champion,' an `opera in jazz'","NEW YORK (AP) — When Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones” proved a sell-out hit at the Metropolitan Opera in 2021, general manager Peter Gelb wasted no time lining up the composer’s other opera for the current season.

And that set the clock ticking for Blanchard and his collaborators to adapt a relatively small-scale work to the vast resources of the nation’s premiere opera house.

“We knew we had only a year and a half, so we immediately went to work,” recalled Michael Cristofer, who wrote the libretto. “We had an opportunity to enhance and expand not just story points but also certain scenes. And you want to use all of what the Met is capable of. We were a bit like kids in a candy shop.”

“Champion,” which Blanchard calls “an opera in jazz,” premiered at Opera Theatre of St. Louis in 2013. It’s based on the troubled life of prizefighter Emile Griffith, who knocked out Benny Paret in a welterweight title bout in 1962. Paret never regained consciousness and died 10 days later.

Griffith was haunted by guilt, his feelings complicated by the fact that Paret had humiliated him by calling him a “maricón,” (a derogatory Spanish term for homosexual) during their weigh-in. Later in Griffith’s life, he was savagely beaten after leaving a gay bar.

Blanchard, who in addition to writing operas is known as a jazz trumpeter and composer of film scores, said he was inspired by Griffith’s own words, rephrased for poetic effect in Cristofer’s libretto: “I killed a man and the world forgives me; I love a man and the world wants to kill me.’”

“To me, ‘Champion’ is about redemption and Emile forgiving himself for what happened in the ring,” Blanchard said.

The original production was directed by James Robinson, the artistic director in St. Louis, who said it was “kind of a chamber piece.” There were just 18 people in the cast plus a four-piece jazz combo that plays along with a traditional orchestra.

For the Met, Robinson devised what he calls a “supersized version” that now brings close to 80 people on stage. Besides the soloists, there are 12 dancers, 10 actors and a chorus of 46. The new production also adds choreography by Camille A. Brown, who created a sensation with her work on “Fire.”

And Blanchard made significant changes to his score, adding new material and rewriting some sections to accommodate the different voice types of his lead singers.

“I’d say maybe 15 to 20 percent has been revised, but the more I think about it, it’s probably a lot more than that,” Blanchard said. There are new chorus parts and two new arias, one for Paret and one for Griffith’s trainer, Howie Albert.

The role of Griffith’s mother, Emelda, was originally written for mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. At the Met, it will be sung by soprano Latonia Moore, prompting substantial alterations, like moving her first aria, “Seven Babies in the Sun,” up by an interval of a fourth.

And Blanchard has kept making changes even during rehearsals, as Moore recounted at a panel discussion at the Guggenheim Museum last month:

“One day he came up to me and said, ‘I feel this scene is a bit too low for you. Mind if I take it up?’”

“I said sure, fantastic,” she added. “I thought he’d come back in a couple days. Less than 30 minutes later, he had completely rewritten the scene. Within half an hour you had new music coming from the composer! This is something I wish I could ask Verdi and Puccini to do.”

Bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green, who stars as the young Emile, was initially skeptical when Gelb asked him to take on the role.

“I had been offered it before and when I looked at the score I thought, ‘This is a little bit too high for me,’” Green said. “I like to sing high notes occasionally, but my voice doesn’t want to sit up there.”

Gelb persuaded him, saying, “Speedo, that’s the beauty of having a living composer. Things can change.”

And change they did, often subtly, with a note here and there taken down a few tones. In one passage shortly after Emile’s first entrance, Blanchard originally called for high G’s, which now have been lowered to B’s, one step below middle C.

In one instance, however, Green went in the opposite direction. For the climax of the aria “What Makes a Man a Man,” he told Blanchard, ″Man, I really want to take it up to create more drama.” So the original D-flat has now been raised to F.

By now, Blanchard’s place as the first Black composer to have an opera performed at the Met is widely known. But with “Champion,” he’s making another kind of history: He’s the first living composer in about 75 years to have different operas performed at the Met in back-to-back seasons. (The last was Richard Strauss with “Der Rosenkavalier” in 1947-48 and “Salome” in 1948-49.)

“Get outa here!” Blanchard said with a laugh when a reporter informed him of that distinction. “That’s crazy.”

And he’s quick to note that his streak will soon be extended, since the Met is reviving “Fire” next season.

And what about a third opera?

“Oh we have some ideas floating about,” Blanchard said. “But we’re just kind of biding our time. Rehearsals have been going so well, that’s where our focus has been.”

Says Robinson, “I told him, ‘You can’t just write two operas.’ But with Terence, it has to be the right story.”

“Champion,” which opens April 10 for nine performances, also stars bass-baritone Eric Owens as the older Emile, tenor Paul Groves as his trainer, mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe as Kathy Hagen, owner of a gay bar, and baritone Eric Greene as Paret. Yannick Nezet-Seguin, the Met’s music director, conducts. The matinee on Sat., April 29, will be shown live in HD in movie theaters worldwide.

This story was first published on April 6, 2023. It was updated on April 12, 2023 to correct the years when a living composer last had two different operas staged in consecutive seasons at the Met. That was Richard Strauss’ “Der Rosenkavalier” in 1947-48 and “Salome” in 1948-49, not the 1943-44 and 1944-45 seasons as the story stated.",0
403,Kenya opposition to resume anti-government protests,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenya’s opposition announced Thursday that anti-government protests will resume after the holy month of Ramadan despite an agreement on talks with the ruling party.

Veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, attending a town hall meeting in the capital, said a resumption date would be announced after Ramadan, which is due to end on Friday.

A rally is scheduled for Sunday at the historic Kamukunji grounds in the capital where the push for multi-party politics was made in the 1990s.

The opposition had previously organized protests twice a week that left four protesters dead and businesses within the capital’s central business district shut down.

During the series of protests, places of worship in Odinga’s stronghold of the Kibera slums and private property belonging to the former president’s family were torched.

The demonstrations were aimed at urging the government to bring down the cost of living and persuading the electoral commission to open to the public the computer servers that handled the 2022 general election — which the opposition has questioned despite the supreme court upholding the result.

President William Ruto, who was declared the victor in those elections, in a state address on April 2 urged the opposition to call off the demonstrations and allow for talks.

Odinga did call off the demonstrations and both sides have since nominated a team of politicians who are to deliberate on issues raised by the opposition.

But the opposition has in recent days accused the government side of not being committed and serious about the talks, questioning the selection of individuals by the ruling party that includes defectors from the opposition.

Odinga now says the protests will continue alongside the talks.

The opposition has been calling for the involvement of other stakeholders, including civil society, in the talks, but the ruling party says it should remain a parliamentary process.

Western diplomatic envoys and civil society groups had called for restraint and dialogue during the series of protests.",0
404,Hundreds forced from Indiana homes as plastics fire burns,"RICHMOND, Ind. (AP) — An evacuation order affecting more than 1,000 people remained in place Wednesday night around a large industrial fire in an Indiana city near the Ohio border where crews worked to douse piles of burning plastics.

Multiple fires that began burning Tuesday afternoon were still burning within about 14 acres of various types of plastics stored inside and outside buildings at a former factory site in Richmond, 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Indianapolis, Fire Chief Tim Brown said.

He said the fire was contained but not under control. Brown said his goal was to finish dousing flames by Saturday morning but “that’s a guess.”

“We are attempting to put the fire out. We are not letting it burn. Evidently there’s some misinformation out there that we’re letting it burn,” he said.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 people who live within a half-mile (0.8 kilometer) of the plant were told to leave after the fire began, said David Hosick, spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security.

The evacuation order remained in place Wednesday night. People outside the half-mile radius who live downwind of the fire were advised to keep windows closed and pets inside.

Brown said the fire’s cause remained under investigation and the only injury had been a firefighter who suffered a minor ankle injury overnight Tuesday.

Some Richmond residents took shelter at Oak Park Pentecostals, after families picking up children from the church’s daycare learned they could not return home, said executive pastor Jesse Arthur. He was expecting the church’s expansive gym — with bathrooms, showers and the daycare — to fill up.

“I think most everybody was exhausted. Long day. Traumatic. Everything’s up in the air,” Arthur told The Associated Press.

State and federal regulators were at the scene to monitor air quality and other environmental impacts. The site, which has been used to store plastics and other materials for recycling or resale, has been the target of enforcement action in recent years.

In 2020, a judge affirmed a cleanup order against Cornerstone Trading Group by Richmond’s Unsafe Building Commission. Inspectors had found fire sprinklers missing and what they cited as “excessive plastic materials” considered to be a fire hazard.

It wasn’t clear what, if any, work had been done since the 2020 court ruling. Messages seeking comment from the city were not immediately returned.

“The nature of my business is I’m a commodities dealer. We gather scrap materials,” Seth Smith of Cornerstone Trading told the commission in 2019, according to meeting minutes. He said that each of the boxes represents 150-200 pounds in scrap. “When we process it inside my facility, that same box will weigh 1,500 pounds and we load them onto the containers that go out to 29 different countries around the world,” he said.

Terry Snyder Jr. spent a restless night at a church Tuesday with his parents, who were worried about their home. All three were coughing from the smoke: Snyder and his mother, Wendy, have asthma, while his father, Terry Snyder Sr., has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

“I didn’t sleep all night. I was nervous,” Wendy Snyder said. “I’ve never been displaced from my home.”

Aaron Stevens, a police officer who lives six blocks from the site, remained at home despite the evacuation order and watched ash fall on his deck and yard.

Jason Sewell, the on-scene coordinator for the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency was sampling air outside the evacuation area and into part of Ohio, but no toxic compounds had been detected.

He stressed, however, that residents in the city of 35,000 should avoid the smoke.

President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and offered his support and any additional federal assistance needed to respond to the fire, the White House said.

EPA Administrator Michael Regan said a team would be collecting debris samples in the area to determine whether anything containing asbestos may have left the site.

“So we’re following the situation very closely and will continue to provide the community with any assistance that they need,” Regan said.

Because of smoke still wafting from the fire, Indiana’s environmental agency issued an air quality advisory for two counties, Wayne and Randolph, warning that forecasts call for elevated levels of fine soot particles.

State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said residents need to get away from smoke plumes, especially elderly people with respiratory problems.

“There’s a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they’re on fire. And so it’s concerning,” Jones said.

Pastor Ken Harris at Bethesda Worship Center in Richmond said his church housed about 20 people Tuesday night before they moved to a larger facility.

“We gave them a safe space to breathe and collect their thoughts,” Harris said as dark gray smoke billowed through the blue sky beyond the church’s windows.

405,Juror says Texas Gov. Abbott's rush to pardon shooter a 'travesty',"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — An alternate juror in the trial of a U. S. Army sergeant convicted of murder said Wednesday that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s rush for a pardon is an “egregious overreach” to wipe aside the jury’s unanimous decision over a 2020 shooting during a Black Lives Matter protest.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Jere Dowell said prosecutors put on a convincing case against Daniel Perry, who was in his car working as a ride-share driver when he shot 28-year-old Garrett Foster, who had been legally carrying an AK-47 while marching with demonstrators through downtown Austin.

As an alternate, Dowell did not have a vote in convicting Perry but said she was in the room for deliberations and she agreed with the verdict handed down Friday.

“I just think it’s a travesty,” Dowell said of Abbott already seeking a pardon.

Her comments are the first time a juror has spoken publicly since Abbott, a Republican, announced Saturday he would use the power of his office and seek to wipe away the verdict. Legal experts have called the governor’s move highly unusual and prosecutors condemned it as troubling.

Abbott made his intentions known on Twitter less than 24 hours after the verdict and amid outrage from conservative voices on social media and television over the conviction.

“I just thought it was an egregious overreach of power,” Dowell said. “It’s undermining due process. It’s undermining democracy. I was upset, honestly.”

Perry, who was on active duty at the time of the shooting, is still awaiting sentencing from a judge. He faces up to life in prison.

Dowell, who said she has not previously supported the three-term governor politically, said she worried that Abbott wading into the case could cause other jurors to second-guess their decisions. She said the verdict was strictly based on evidence, following 17 hours of deliberation, and politics did not factor in.

“If your governor is coming out and saying you made the wrong decision, that may make you think twice about what you said or what you felt,” she told AP.

The AP has attempted to reach all jurors who served during the weeklong trial in Austin. Others have declined to speak about the case or not returned messages.

Spokespersons for Abbott did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday.

The trial had received little national attention prior to Friday’s verdict and Abbott had not previously commented on the case publicly. He has has not elaborated on how he reached his conclusion about Perry’s case, and his office on Monday referred questions to his statement on Twitter.

The encounter leading up to the shooting began when Perry turned onto a street and into one of the demonstrations that swept the country after Minneapolis police killed of George Floyd.

In video that was streamed live on Facebook, a car can be heard honking amid the downtown crowd. Then, several shots ring out, and protesters begin screaming and scattering.

Perry drove off, later calling police to report the shooting, and officers arrived to find Foster shot. What led up to the gunfire was a core question in the trial that resulted in Perry’s conviction.

Dowell said her confidence in the verdict was based in part on testimony that Foster’s gun was pointing up — close to his ear — moments before the shooting and that Foster was at least a foot away from Perry’s car.

She said prosecutors also presented text messages between Perry and a friend, exchanged prior to the shooting, discussing other cases in which protesters had been shot and whether it amounted to self-defense.

Witnesses testified that Foster never raised his rifle at Perry, and prosecutors said the sergeant could have driven off rather than opening fire with a handgun. Perry didn’t testify. But his defense attorneys have said Foster pointed his gun at the driver and that the shooting was self-defense.

“I look forward to approving the Board’s pardon as soon as it hits my desk,” Abbott tweeted Saturday.

Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza, whose office prosecuted the case, said Wednesday in an interview on CNN that it appeared clear that neither Abbott nor his staff had watched the trial. Garza, who ran as a progressive when he was elected in 2020, has previously been a target of criticism from the governor.

The district attorney said he did not know why Abbott was pushing for the pardon: “I don’t know what’s in the governor’s mind.”

Garza has requested to meet with the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles and present evidence. The board did not immediately respond to questions emailed Wednesday.

Clint Broden, Perry’s attorney, has said they did not petition the governor for a pardon prior to Abbott’s tweet. He has also filed a motion seeking a new trial.

406,Metallica returns with '72 Seasons'; band not slowing down,"NEW YORK (AP) — Zoom has been credited for keeping students and teachers connected, the judicial system working and fitness classes jumping. You can add a Metallica album to that list.

The hard rockers met weekly over their computers to stay connected during the pandemic, a standing get-together that eventually became a songwriting factory. The first step was an acoustic version of their song “Blackened.”

“It proved to us that, yes, we can at least do something remotely while we’re all still separated,” says guitarist Kirk Hammett. “That grew into trying to get riffs together for the new album though Zoom.”

Six or seven of those song sketches ended up on “72 Seasons,” the band’s 12th full-length album, out Friday. It’s the sound of a band not slowing down, despite singer and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich turning 60 this year and Hammett already on the other side of that milestone. Bassist Robert Trujillo is the baby, at just 58.

“It ended up working really fantastic,” says Hetfield. “I know what we do. I know what we do best. I know what we’ve done before. But there’s also an artist in me that wants to keep evolving and trying to do different stuff.”

The album is a typical Metallica album — fast and furious with superb artistry — and lyrics that poke at the scab of pain and alienation. Yet there are some shoots of hope, as when Hetfield snarls, “Without darkness/There’s no light.”

“Darkness is easy to talk about for me. So, so easy. And I wanted to offer a little more light in it,” says Hetfield, who has been frank with his battles with addiction.

The title refers to the first 18 years of a person’s life and the album explores the cruelty of youth and the dangers of growing up.

“I wish I knew then what I know now — you can take that sentence, and apply it to the whole concept of this album,” says Hammett. “It’s a real provocative sort of concept that’s somewhat challenging and somewhat introspective.”

Noteworthy is “Screaming Suicide,” with a nasty inner voice taunting the singer. While far from the first time the band has tackled the issue, this time Hetfield drives into it, singing “Don’t ever speak my name/Remember you’re to blame/Keep me inside/My name is suicide.”

“That was some delicate territory to navigate. But in the words of Mister Rogers, ‘If it’s a human experience, we should be able to talk about it,’” says Hetfield. “I’ve had those thoughts. Who hasn’t had those thoughts? If you say you haven’t, maybe you’re fooling yourself a little bit.”

Hammett is full of admiration for Hetfield’s lyrics and hopes the songs can help listeners get a better understanding of themselves.

“The topics are dark. The topics are taboo. But what he’s doing is shining light on them. He’s bringing awareness to them and saying this is a real issue that people need to deal with.”

“72 Seasons” also sees Hetfield experimenting with vocal effects and styles, like ghostlike chanting on “You Must Burn!” and an almost languid, glam vibe on “Crown of Barbed Wire.”

“As far as vocals go, I really wanted to just explore some different stuff. I have a fear that all the songs kind of end up sounding the same. So I like giving them a little more character with different things,” he says.

Another change is that on “72 Seasons,” Hammett and Trujillo were given writing credits on more than half the album, a return to the way previous albums came together, like “Death Magnetic” and “St. Anger.”

“All four guys were on the floor when we were writing, which is new for us. Usually it’s just Lars and I sitting out there hashing it out. It felt really great to have the energy of all four,” says Hetfield. “There’s a lot more democracy on this album. Lars and I gave up the steering wheel a little more than usual.”

Hammett agrees: “It was much more collaborative. The attitude was just more open. There is less limitations on everyone’s creativity and I think that shows.” His favorite song and riff on the album were supplied by Trujillo.

The band has lately gotten a popular bounce from TV show “Stranger Things.” In the season four finale, fan-favorite character Eddie Munson heroically rocks out to Metallica’s “Master of Puppets” in the Upside Down, a sequence Hammett calls “the Metallica music video that was never made.” The song even reached No. 40 the Billboard Hot 100.

“‘Stranger Things’ definitely took ‘Master of Puppets’ to another level and it feels like fans of ours that maybe grew up with this are now in positions of power,” says Hetfield. “You know, it’s like, ‘Hey, I’m a fan of Metallica. Why can’t we put this in there?’ So I’m super-grateful.”

The album closes with “Inamorata,” a sprawling song that uncoils with snarling riffs as Hetfield sings, “Misery, she needs me/Oh, but I need her more.” It clocks in at 11:10, making it one of Metallica’s longest songs.

“I hate long songs. I really do. I try to write shorter songs and Lars keeps making them longer. And that’s our kind of constant battle,” says Hetfield, who is a fan of Motorhead, Misfits and the Ramones.

“I’m never concerned about what the number is at the end of the song as long as it does its purpose,” he adds. “We’re not out to prove anything and we’re not out to set records like, ‘Hey, this is our longest song ever. How great!’ You know, there’s no mission there whatsoever. The song wrote itself.”

Fans may hope to hear many of the new songs on the band’s upcoming European and North American stadium tour but not everyone will have the same experience. Metallica plans to hit cities with two concerts per stop and promise two completely different setlists.

“We kind of need to be challenged because we’ve been playing these songs for so long and we need to change them around to still make them interesting and fun for us,” says Hammett. Hetfield agrees: “It’s fun for us and hopefully fun for the fans. And if they want to come to both shows, that would be fantastic.”",0

408,Inmate who escaped by faking death back in S. Africa,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A man serving a life sentence for murder and rape who escaped from a top-security prison with help from guards by faking his own burning death was brought back to South Africa early Thursday after going on the run with his girlfriend.

The couple were arrested in Tanzania last weekend.

State broadcaster SABC showed video of Thabo Bester being driven from Johannesburg’s Lanseria Airport in a police vehicle with bars across the windows. Heavily-armed police put the girlfriend, celebrity doctor Nandipha Magudumana, into a separate white van at the airport.

Magudumana was expected to be charged with murder as part of the elaborate jailbreak plot, which involved getting a dead body into the prison where Bester was incarcerated to help him stage his own death in a fire and escape.

A prison guard and Magudumana’s father already were charged with murder in connection with the body of a man found burned beyond recognition in Bester’s cell. The unidentified man died of blunt force trauma to the head before the fire, police said.

Police and officials from South Africa’s Ministry of Justice confirmed Bester and Magudumana were back in the country and said more arrests were expected.

Bester was convicted on one count of murder and two counts of rape and sentenced in 2012. He escaped from Mangaung Correctional Centre in Free State province nearly a year ago, when he was formally declared dead by suicide after the fire in his cell.

Details were only made public and pieced together in the past three weeks. Critics allege officials intentionally covered up the story.

Lawmakers held an hours-long parliamentary hearing Wednesday into security failures that played a role in the breakout. They questioned senior officials from the prison and British private security company G4S, which has a long-term contract to run it.

Three prison employees, the night supervisor and two guards who worked in the security camera control room, were fired due to suspicion they helped Bester escape amid the confusion of the predawn blaze in his cell on May 3, 2022.

Although one was charged with murder, lawmaker Glynnis Breytenbach said she suspected more guards and officials were bribed to get the body into the cell and help Bester escape.

“How many palms were greased?” Breytenbach asked during the hearing. “Are you honestly telling us this escape of Hollywood proportion was done with the assistance of only three people?”

The prison and G4S officials conceded under questioning that a TV cabinet big enough to possibly hide a dead body in was brought into the prison in an unauthorized vehicle hours before Bester broke out around 4 a.m. the following morning. Neither the cabinet nor the vehicle was searched.

They also said top prison officials gave Bester permission to be transferred to a single-occupant cell three days before his escape. The cell was situated next to a fire exit, which he’s believed to have used to flee.

Lawmaker Xola Nqola said it was “not a coincidence” that Bester was moved to that cell.

An internal investigation by G4S found the prison’s security camera recording system had a “power interruption” around the time of the escape.

Bester was a renowned criminal known as the “Facebook rapist” for using the social media site to lure his victims to meetings. He was found guilty of murder for stabbing his girlfriend, a model, to death in 2011 and raping two other female models.

For months after Bester’s escape, he and Magudumana, whom police identified as his “accomplice,” lived in a mansion in a wealthy suburb of Johannesburg, driving luxury cars while running a company that allegedly defrauded businesses out of hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to media reports.

Authorities only announced publicly last month that Bester did not die in his cell and had escaped after South African news organization GroundUp reported that the charred body found in the cell wasn’t Bester’s, according to findings from the autopsy.

The news and heightened public interest in the case appeared to have spurred Bester and Magudumana to flee the country. It also produced heavy criticism against authorities for failing to warn the public that a dangerous criminal was on the loose.

The parliamentary hearing focused on the initial prison failures and continued Thursday. More hearings were scheduled on what police, the Department of Corrections and South Africa’s Ministry of Justice knew about Bester’s escape and when they found out about it.",0
409,Breakaway group aims to save boxing's Olympic status,"LONDON (AP) — American and British boxing officials are among the leaders of a breakaway group launched Thursday with the aim of saving boxing’s place at the Olympics.

The new federation, to be called World Boxing, is a rival to the 77-year-old International Boxing Association, which has been suspended from organizing the sport at the Olympics amid longstanding concerns about fair judging and the IBA’s ties to Russia.

“Amateur, Olympic-style boxing was facing elimination from the Olympic Games,” said USA Boxing president Tyson Lee, who is on the interim board of the new organization. “I can speak for the United States and many other national federations. We have a vested interest in maintaining a pathway to the Olympic movement and somewhere along the line that turned out to not be a priority for IBA.”

World Boxing will be based in Switzerland and have a board consisting of athletes and officials, including Lee and GB Boxing chief executive Matthew Holt. Lauren Price of Britain, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and silver medalist Richard Torrez Jr. of the United States are on the board as athlete representatives.

Elections for a president and a new board are planned for November.

“This is about the future of the sport,” Holt said. “Our status on the Olympic program is on life support and we, as an organization, need to breathe new life into it. We want to operate in the best interests of the boxers.”

A standoff between the IBA and the International Olympic Committee meant boxing was left off the initial program for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. Boxing is part of next year’s Paris Olympics, but it will be organized by the IOC.

The IOC suspended the IBA in 2019 after years of concerns about its finances, governance and claims that fights at the 2016 Olympics were manipulated. Current IBA president Umar Kremlev took over in 2020, bringing financial backing from Russian state gas company Gazprom.

The IOC wants Russians to compete as neutral athletes in Olympic sports following the invasion of Ukraine, but Kremlev’s IBA has allowed them to fight at the world championships with national flags and anthems, drawing another rebuke from the IOC.

The United States and Britain were among more than 10 countries that announced boycotts of the recent women’s world championships and upcoming men’s world championships because of Russia’s position and wider concerns about the IBA. Kremlev said officials who backed a boycott were “worse than hyenas and jackals.”

World Boxing interim secretary general Simon Toulson said the new organization was operating with a budget of 900,000 euros ($994,000) this year, without naming any specific funding sources. That’s a small fraction of the resources at the IBA, which offers up to $200,000 for gold medalists at the traditionally amateur men’s world championships and $100,000 at the women’s world championships.

The new organization says it is reaching out to national boxing bodies around the world but is not taking on members yet. None of the national bodies whose members are involved have quit the IBA, they said.

Toulson added that “we’ve had no contact with the IOC regarding the setting up of this organization” but hoped to soon. The IOC told The Associated Press in a statement that it “takes note of the latest developments.”

The World Boxing board also includes Dutch official Boris van der Vorst, who challenged Kremlev for the IBA presidency last year but was barred from the vote for “prohibited collaboration” in his campaign. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that it had been wrong to bar him, but no new vote was held.

In response, IBA secretary general and chief executive George Yerolimpos said “rogue world governing bodies and orchestrated coups are nothing new to sport, and like any well-governed organization, there are mechanisms put in place to protect the organization, its members, and in the end, the athletes.”

Yerolimpos said in the IBA’s statement that participants in the new group could face IBA sanctions.

“For those involved in the creation of the rogue international boxing organization and the nations who claim to be members of it, there is no doubt that the IBA will reserve its rights to claim damages from any person who is harming the IBA’s activities and reputation, and/or trying to achieve exclusion of the IBA from the Olympic family,” he said.

The signing took place on the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing, where a gunman killed three students and injured five others two months ago. Flanked by students and gun safety advocates, Whitmer, a graduate of MSU, told the more than 100 people in attendance to “buckle up, we’re going to continue this work.”

“Gun violence is a scourge that is unique to this country,” Whitmer said. “We don’t have to live like this and today, we are showing we are not going to anymore.”

The legislation is part of a sweeping 11-bill gun safety package that was introduced in the weeks following the MSU shooting but was predominately drafted after the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in which four students were killed. The bills saw little movement at the time with Republicans in control of the Legislature.

Gun safety advocates, who poured into the state Capitol on Thursday afternoon, cheered loudly from the gallery above the House chamber as Democrats voted to approve red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. The Senate passed the measures in March but will need to give final approval on several amendments before the bills are sent to Whitmer. The Democratic governor has said she would sign the package if and when it gets to her desk.

Extreme risk protection orders are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior to stop them from hurting themselves or others. An Associated Press investigation last year found that many U. S. states barely use the red flag laws.

Under the legislation signed Thursday, criminal background checks will be required for anyone buying a rifle or shotgun, which had previously only been required for purchases of pistols. The safe storage bills will require gun owners to keep unloaded firearms in a locked storage box or container when it is “reasonably known that a minor is or is likely to be present on the premises.” The laws will go into effect next year.

Safe storage requirements gained momentum after Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 years old at the time, killed four classmates and wounded seven other people at Oxford High School. Afterward, he admitting using a gun that was not locked in a box at home and had been purchased for him by his father. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter for the acts of Ethan, who has pleaded guilty to terrorism and first-degree murder charges.

Supporters have also said the safe storage requirements will protect teenagers from using firearms in suicide attempts.

Calling gun violence a “uniquely American problem,” Whitmer drew attention to mass shootings across the country during her remarks Thursday, specifically referencing recent shootings in Nashville and Louisville.

Numerous state legislatures across the country are debating ways to address gun violence. A shooting in downtown Louisville this week was the 15th mass killing of the year in the U. S. in which four or more people were killed other than the perpetrator. That is the most during the first 100 days of a calendar year since 2009.

The U. S. is sharply divided over what steps, if any, to take in the face of violence that involves firearms. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected Republican presidential candidate who visited Michigan last week, signed a bill this month that allows people in his state to carry concealed firearms without a permit, and without training or a background check. It takes effect July 1.",0
411,Irish rally driver Craig Breen killed in accident,"MUNICH (AP) — Rally driver Craig Breen was killed in an accident Thursday during a test event ahead of a world championship race in Croatia, his team said.

Police were investigating the full circumstances of the 33-year-old Irish driver’s death, which was attributed to “skidding off track,” Daniel Šaškin, president of the organizing committee of the Croatia Rally, said at a news conference.

Hyundai Motorsport said it was “deeply saddened to confirm” Breen’s death “following an accident during the pre-event test” for the Croatia Rally.

“Co-driver James Fulton was unharmed in the incident that occurred just after midday local time,” the team said in a statement. “Hyundai Motorsport sends its sincerest condolences to Craig’s family, friends and his many fans. Hyundai Motorsport will make no further comment at this time.”

Breen had competed in World Rally Championship events since 2009 for various teams. The event in Croatia was scheduled to start next week.

“On behalf of the FIA, I wish to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Craig Breen following his passing during a private testing accident in Croatia,” said Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of governing body FIA. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones and the entire Rally community at this difficult time.”

Breen was the son of a former Irish national rally champion and began his career in karting. He won several rally titles at various levels of national and international competitions, and was a regular podium finisher in the World Rally Championship. In 2012, he was involved in an accident at a rally in Italy in which his co-driver, Gareth Roberts, was killed.

“The Irish motorsport community is numbed by this tragic news,” Motorsport Ireland president Aidan Harper said in a statement. “Craig was a world class driver and a world class person.”",0
412,Mississippi getting designated burn center again,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — After the October closure of Mississippi’s only accredited burn center threatened to upend access to care, the state’s next designated burn center will be housed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, the state Department of Health announced Tuesday.

State officials approved the hospital’s application months after the facility rolled out its new burn unit in January. The unit was established in response to the closure of the burn center at Merit Health Central, which had Mississippi’s only accredited burn center. Some burn patients were initially redirected to hospitals in other states.

“We are pleased that the University of Mississippi Medical Center has been deemed qualified to provide the level of multidisciplinary care required for burn treatment,” Dr. Peter Arnold, chief of the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, said in a news release. “The depth of medical skills and resources of an academic medical center make UMMC uniquely qualified and an ideal location for burn treatment in the state.”

Merit Health Central, a South Jackson hospital, said the COVID-19 pandemic and staffing challenges made operating their burn unit too difficult. Ahead of the closure, UMMC said it would help fill the void.

The UMMC news release said the hospital’s care team for burn patients would include specialists in emergency medicine and trauma surgery, as well as several sub-specialties in plastic surgery, critical care, laboratory medicine, mental health, occupational therapy and physical therapy.",0
413,"On India's shore, rising salinity means daily water struggle","KOCHI, India (AP) — Anthony Kuttappassera’s family has lived in the same house at the edge of the Arabian Sea for more than a century. He grew up drinking water from the pond and the well outside his home.

But 60 years ago, that water became too salty to drink. Then it grew too salty for bathing or washing clothes. Now, the pond is green, buggy and nearly dry — just like the rest of the wells and ponds in the Chellanam area of Kochi, a city of about 600,000 people on India’s southwestern coast.

Rising seas from climate change are bringing saltwater into the fresh water of places like Chellanam, rendering unusable what had been a vital part of everyday life. And frequent breaks in the pipelines that bring fresh water from inland exacerbates the misery for residents in this village of about 8 square kilometers (3 square miles), requiring water to be trucked in.

Each truckload of water has to be poured into barrels and buckets and carried by hand to the village’s 600 households.

“We do not have clean water for even cleaning ourselves. We are surrounded by water but we do not have any consumable water,” the 73-year-old Kuttappassera said. “When this pond was in usable condition there was no such issue and we had enough water for everything. There was no need for any other source. But now we are using packed water for everything.”

EDITOR’S NOTE: This article is part of a series produced under the India Climate Journalism Program, a collaboration between The Associated Press, the Stanley Center for Peace and Security and the Press Trust of India.

Although saltwater invasion of crucial groundwater supplies is a climate change problem around the world, richer nations can adapt more easily. It hits harder in countries like India, expected to surpass China as the world’s most populous nation this year. India is still regarded as a developing nation even as it has grown into one of the world’s largest economies.

India is the world’s third-highest emitter of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming. The nation is increasingly prioritizing a transition to clean energy, with ambitious targets for renewables, a green hydrogen initiative to make clean fuel and a program encouraging individual citizens to live more sustainably.

But that shift will take time. Meanwhile, rising seas, changing ocean patterns, extreme storms, overuse of wells and over-development all contribute to the growing salinity problem in the Kochi region, scientists said. And that challenge in coastal areas comes in a nation where access to freshwater was already an issue. Less than half of India’s population has access to clean drinking water, according to UNICEF.

“People are suffering because the aquifers are getting salinized,” said Bijoy Nandan, dean of marine sciences at Cochin University of Science and Technology. Salinity has increased by 30% to 40% since the first studies of water in the area in 1971, he said.

S. Sreekesh, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, studied the worsening threat in the Kochi area looking at satellite, tide gauge and other data from the 1970s through 2020. He found seas rising by about 1.8 millimeters (0.07 inch) a year.

Getting water in Chellanam is always difficult, but the pipeline breaks make it even harder. The daily struggle could be seen during a recent outage that lasted about a month. Bringing the water in by truck — or rowed in via small boats — was only a start in a game of going from bigger pots of water to smaller.

Four giant trucks carrying 36,000 liters of water made it as far as a church parking lot, but couldn’t go any farther due to narrow winding streets. Their water was transferred into smaller tankers: 6,000 liters, 4,000 liters and even a toy-like 1,000-liter truck.

Those smaller trucks then made their way toward deliveries along one of the wider roads, stopping every few meters (yards) where large blue barrels were set up. The truck driver would hop out, connect a tube and turn a spigot to slowly fill barrel after barrel. Residents then dipped silvery aluminum 5- and 6-liter pots into the barrels.

Maryamma Pillai, 82, is among residents who wait on a truck nearly every day to get clean water. With no tap at home, she has to either buy water — about 40 rupees, or almost $0.50, for 5 liters — or wait for the government tanker truck to get it for free.

A heart condition makes it particularly difficult for Pillai to carry her seven pots and buckets the 100 meters back to her home. She has to take breaks as her chest grows heavy.

“I don’t have water for anything at home, not even washing my face, so I try to gather water in as many sources – buckets, pots and tumblers — to take back home,” she said, thumping her chest to ease the tightness that often comes when she carries heavy objects.

Pillai said water scarcity is getting worse ever year as summers become more extreme.

“This was not the case earlier when we used to know how to plan for which season with more water availability but now everything is unknown, unpredictable and unreliable,” she said.

Another resident, Karni Kumar, lives far enough away from the main road that it’s more convenient to use a wooden boat to cross a small stretch of backwater to get fresh water from the neighboring district of Alleppey. But so many other Chellanam families do the same thing that it can more than double the demand on a single tap in Alleppey — leading to long waits and occasional conflicts with Alleppey residents.

The Rev. John Kalathil, vicar of St. George Church in South Chellanam, said the area’s residents have to pay 100 to 200 rupees (about $1.21 to $2.42 per day) for the water they need to drink, cook and wash. That can be around 15% of their daily income.

Almost all the wage-earners in his parish are fishermen, with a deep connection and love for the sea that is a source of life for them.

“They call it Kadalamma, which means they look at sea as their mother,” he said. “But the situation is very terrible for them because of climate change, weather, change in sea and water sources.”",0
414,Average long-term US mortgage rate drops a 5th straight week,"The average long-term U. S. mortgage rate inched down for the fifth straight week, positive news for potential home buyers and a real estate market that’s been chilled by the Federal Reserve’s series of interest rate hikes the past year.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate ticked down to 6.27% from 6.28% the previous week. The average rate last year at this time was 5%.

The average long-term mortgage rate hit 7.08% in the fall — a two-decade high.

The recent decline in mortgage rates is good news for prospective homebuyers, many of whom were pushed to the sidelines during the past year as the Federal Reserve raised its main lending rate nine straight times in a bid to beat back stubborn, four-decade high inflation.

Though supply remains low, home prices are retreating slightly, another development that could lure buyers back into the market. The national median home price slipped 0.2% from February last year to $363,000, marking the first annual decline in 13 years, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Rising borrowing costs can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for homebuyers and cooled off a red-hot housing market. Before surging 14.5% in February, sales of existing homes had fallen for 12 straight months to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years.

In 2022, existing U. S. home sales fell 17.8% from 2021, the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since the housing crisis began in 2008, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier this year.

In their latest quarterly economic projections, Fed policymakers forecast that they expect to raise that key rate just once more — from its new level of about 4.9% to 5.1%, the same peak they had projected in December.

While the Fed’s rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investor expectations for future inflation, global demand for U. S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.

Treasury yields have fluctuated wildly since the collapse of two mid-size U. S. banks last month. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, was at 3.41% Thursday but had been above 4% early in March.

The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, fell this week to 5.54% from 5.64% last week. It was 4.17% one year ago.",0
415,Twins put Farmer on injured list after hit in face by pitch,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Minnesota Twins placed shortstop Kyle Farmer on the 10-day injured list on Thursday, the day after he was hit in the face by a pitch and needed surgery to reset his bottom four teeth and suture lacerations around his lower lip.

The Twins made the move before their game against the New York Yankees. They already had four regular position players on the injured list.

“The scar is probably going to be there. It’s significant,” manager Rocco Baldelli said. “His bottom four teeth were pushed back.”

The Twins had quite the scare when the 32-year-old Farmer was knocked to the dirt by a 92 mph fastball that got away from Chicago White Sox pitcher Lucas Giolito in the fourth inning of Minnesota’s win on Wednesday. Farmer avoided any fractures to his jaw, which Baldelli said was “probably some sort of miracle.”

“I don’t anticipate there being a timeline any time soon,” Baldelli said. “We may have a general rough idea and then there’s the build back once he heals up. ... He’s not going to be eating solid food for at least a little while, things like that that we’re going to have to work through.”

Outfielder Kyle Garlick was promoted from Triple-A St. Paul to take Farmer’s spot. Outfielder Gilberto Celestino was transferred to the 60-day injured list so Garlick could be added to the 40-man roster.",0
416,Lauder family pledges $200M to its Alzheimer's research work,"NEW YORK (AP) — The sons of cosmetics giant Estée Lauder, along with her four grandchildren, pledged $200 million Tuesday to the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation, a nonprofit the family founded to support research into finding a cure for the disease.

Leonard and Ronald Lauder founded the organization in 1998 in honor of their mother, who had Alzheimer’s as did other members of her family, said Mark Roithmayr, the CEO of ADDF.

“They have collectively made this family gift to see through the work of the next 10 to 15 years to finish off what Estée started,” said Roithmayr.

Starting with a $100 million gift from their mother, the Lauder sons chose to invest in early research of potential treatments using what they called “venture philanthropy,” meaning any returns on their investments were put toward future research. The family also pledges to cover the organization’s expenses so all outside donations go entirely to funding research, Roithmayr said.

The ADDF will receive the pledged $200 million over the next ten years and is expected to distribute them in grants over the next 15 years. The commitment will also allow the Lauders to continue to cover ADDF’s expenses, Roithmayr said.

More than 50 million people worldwide have Alzheimer’s, which gradually attacks areas of the brain needed for memory, reasoning, communication and daily tasks. Scientists don’t yet know exactly how Alzheimer’s forms, but one theory is that the buildup of a protein called amyloid plays a key role.

The FDA has approved two drugs that target the buildup of amyloid, though the 2021 approval of Biogen’s Aduhelm garnered controversy after the agency overruled its own independent scientific advisers. Legembi, a second drug, approved in January, is the first that’s been convincingly shown to slow the decline in memory and thinking that defines Alzheimer’s by targeting the disease’s underlying biology.

“The need to invest in research is paramount,” said Heather Snyder, a vice president of the Alzheimer’s Association. “Investing in research is how we’re going to understand the underlying biology and translate that to treatment and interventions that will benefit all individuals.”

She said there is a sense of momentum in Alzheimer’s research, in part because of the approval of the new drugs — even though they are not currently covered by Medicaid and Medicare, meaning that many will not have access to them.

Her organization currently funds $320 million in research projects that span from studying the biology of aging to diagnostic tools, clinical trials and care for patients with dementia, as well as investing in advocacy around federal funding for Alzheimer’s research.

Roithmayr said the Lauder family wants to accelerate the timeline for when research will yield treatments by making investments where pharmaceutical companies and the federal government are not.

“Our idea is to take our funding, put it into these translational science, kind of in this valley of death where you’ve got good ideas, but they’re very risky,” he said.

417,"Syria's rapprochement advances with Tunisia, Saudi Arabia","BEIRUT (AP) — Syria will reopen its embassy in Tunisia, state media reported Wednesday, as Syria’s top diplomat visited Saudi Arabia seeking to restore ties that have been severed for more than a decade.

Tunisia has become the latest Arab state to reestablish diplomatic ties with Syria, after cutting off relations in 2012. Tunisian President Kais Saied announced earlier this month that he had directed the country’s foreign ministry to appoint a new ambassador to Syria.

His move to appoint a new ambassador to Syria was reciprocated by the Syrian government, a joint statement from the two countries’ foreign ministries said Wednesday, according to Syrian state news agency SANA.

The announcement was the latest in a regional trend of rapprochement with the war-torn country, which has picked up pace since the massive Feb. 6 earthquake in Turkey and Syria, and the Chinese-brokered reestablishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

Syria was widely shunned by Arab governments over Syrian President Bashar Assad’s brutal crackdown on protesters and later civilians in an uprising turned civil war that began in 2011. The breakdown in relations culminated with Syria being ousted from the Arab League. Tunis shut down its embassy in Damascus in 2012.

Earlier this year, Assad visited Oman and the United Arab Emirates, two nations that had backed fighters trying to topple his government. The Syrian government is reportedly in talks with Saudi Arabia to reopen their embassies in Damascus and Riyadh.

A delegation headed by Syria’s foreign minister arrived in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday for talks about bilateral relations between the two countries, Syrian state media reported, the first such visit since 2012.

Saudi state media reported that Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mikdad was received by the kingdom’s Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji. The meeting focused on “efforts to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis that preserves Syria’s unity, security and stability, facilitates the return of Syrian refugees to their homeland and secures the delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected areas in Syria.”

Saudi Arabia is hosting the next Arab League summit in May, where most states hope to restore Syria’s membership, the league’s secretary-general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, has said.",0
418,Romance novel model gets prison for Jan. 6 attack on police,"A Michigan pipelayer who modeled for covers of romance novels was sentenced on Thursday to three years in prison for assaulting police at the U. S. Capitol during a mob’s attack.

Logan Barnhart joined one of the most brutal clashes between rioters and police on Jan. 6, 2021. He grabbed an officer by his neck and torso and dragged him into the crowd of rioters on the Capitol’s Lower West Terrace. Minutes later, he returned to a police line and swung a flagpole at officers.

Barnhart, 42, of Holt, Michigan, said he didn’t recognize himself on a video, shown in court, that captured him assaulting the officer.

“The way I was acting seems so foreign to me,” he told U. S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras.

Contreras also sentenced Barnhart to three years of supervised release after his prison term and ordered him to pay a $3,688 fine and $2,000 in restitution. Contreras said anybody who “directly and brazenly” attacks police is inherently dangerous to the public.

“He ran to the fight,” the judge said.

Earlier on Thursday, a former Capitol police officer avoided a prison sentence for trying to help a Virginia fisherman avoid criminal charges for storming the building his law enforcement colleagues defended on Jan. 6. U. S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Michael Angelo Riley to two years of probation and four months of home detention.

Riley, a 25-year police veteran, was on duty when a mob attacked the Capitol, injuring more than 100 officers. Riley’s voice cracked as he lamented how his “awful judgment” cost him his career, tarnished his reputation, ended friendships in the department and traumatized his family.

“The amount of regret and remorse I have over this situation is unimaginable,” Riley told the judge.

In Barnhart’s case, federal prosecutors had recommended a prison term of five years and three months. Barnhart has been on home detention while awaiting his sentencing. The judge ordered him to remain on home detention until he reports to prison at a date to be determined.

Barnhart has worked as a pipelayer and heavy machine operator for construction companies. NBC News reported that Barnhart has modeled for covers of romance novels, including “Stepbrother UnSEALed: A Bad Boy Military Romance.” Internet sleuths using facial recognition technology found photographs of Barnhart from his modeling career, NBC reported.

Defense attorney Michelle Peterson said Barnhart drove alone to Washington, D. C., to attend the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6 because he wanted to support then-President Donald Trump and believed the baseless claims that Democrats stole the election from the Republican incumbent.

“Now two years away from the chaos of that day, he is deeply remorseful and cannot understand how he acted so foolishly,” Peterson wrote.

Barnhart was charged with several other riot defendants in the same indictment.

Barnhart and co-defendants Jack Whitton and Jeffrey Sabol dragged a Metropolitan Police Department officer away from a police line, down stairs and into the crowd, where co-defendants Peter Stager and Mason Joel Courson beat the officer with a flagpole and a baton, according to prosecutors.

Barnhart was arrested in August 2021 and pleaded guilty in September 2022 to assaulting the officer with a dangerous weapon.

“He threw that officer to the wolves,” prosecutor Benet Kearney said.

Barnhart wrote an apology letter addressed to the officer. He said he was ashamed of his behavior on Jan. 6.

“I hope one day we can all put aside our petty differences that seem to be tearing our beautiful country apart,” Barnhart wrote.

In the case against Riley, the former Capitol police officer, prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of two years and three months.

The judge said Riley’s actions were “shocking conduct for any member of law enforcement.”

“You knew exactly how bad January 6th was,” she added. Jackson also ordered him to pay a $10,000 fine and perform 150 hours of community service.

On Jan. 6, 2021, Riley investigated a report of an explosive device at Republican National Committee headquarters and helped an injured officer. The following day, he posted a Facebook message calling for federal charges against anybody who assaulted police, damaged property or breached the Capitol.

“If we don’t send a message it will surely happen again,” he wrote.

Less than two hours later, Riley read a Facebook post by Jacob Hiles, a fisherman he knew from YouTube videos. Hiles wrote about his own participation in the riot and posted a video of rioters clashing with police.

Riley, 51, of Maryland, privately messaged Hiles and identified himself as a Capitol police officer who agreed with his “political stance.”

“Take down the part about being in the building they are currently investigating and everyone who was in the building is going to be charged. Just looking out!” Riley wrote.

They continued to exchange friendly messages until Hiles told Riley that the FBI was “very curious” that they had been communicating.

“They took my phone and downloaded everything,” Hiles wrote.

Riley immediately deleted all of their private messages, according to prosecutors.

Riley was charged with two counts of obstruction of justice. In October 2022, a jury convicted him of one count but deadlocked on the second.

Riley described his actions as “stupid and reckless” but said he didn’t think he was breaking the law.

“It certainly doesn’t excuse my lapse in judgment,” he said.

Hiles pleaded guilty in September 2021 to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Jackson sentenced him in December 2021 to two years of probation and ordered him to complete 60 hours of community service.

More than 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 riot. Over 600 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted after trials decided by a jury or judge. Over 450 of them have been sentenced, with over half getting terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.",0
419,Report criticizes Dutch authorities over risky emissions,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Businesses and local governments in the Netherlands must do more to protect residents who live near large industrial plants against the damaging effects of emissions, an independent report concluded Thursday.

The investigation by the Dutch Safety Board was launched amid long-standing concerns that residents were being exposed to potentially dangerous emissions and anger that companies and local authorities were not responsive.

The probe initially focused on a Tata Steel plant in the North Sea coastal town of Ijmuiden. It was later expanded to include a Chemours chemical plant in Dordrecht and an asphalt manufacturer in Nijmegen.

The Tata Steel plant has long been a source of concern for local residents. Dutch prosecutors last year opened a criminal investigation into alleged “intentional and unlawful introduction of hazardous substances into the soil, air or surface water.” In addition, the probe targets Harsco Metals Holland, a company that also operates at the Tata Steel plant in Ijmuiden.

“Local governments and environmental services must make better use of the current system of licensing, supervision and enforcement to protect the health of local residents,” the Dutch Safety Board said in its report.

“Due to a lack of knowledge, capacity and sense of urgency, the government often acts reactively. This means that harmful emissions can continue for a long time,” the board said.

Tata said in a reaction on its website that the investigation’s conclusions “speak for themselves.”

“We embrace the conclusion that there needs to be a better picture of the effect of industry emissions on the environment and that even more efforts need to be made to reduce these effects,” the company said.

In a reaction, Chemours said it continued “to invest in measures that significantly further reduce our emissions. In doing so, we work as closely as possible with the government in setting and achieving ambitious environmental goals. We also actively seek dialogue with the people around us.”",0
420,Judge admonishes Fox lawyers over evidence gap in libel case,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — The judge presiding over a defamation case against Fox News admonished its attorneys Wednesday for potentially withholding evidence and said he is inclined to order an independent review by a special master that could lead to sanctions.

The move by Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis came amid a burst of fresh revelations in the $1.6 billion defamation case filed by Dominion Voting Systems against the conservative network and its parent company, Fox Corp.

The judge expressed anger and frustration during a pretrial hearing after learning that Fox only recently turned over recordings of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo talking with two lawyers for then-President Donald Trump, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani. That came after the disclosure a day earlier that Fox lawyers had withheld critical information about the role company founder Rupert Murdoch, who is chairman of Fox Corp., played at Fox News.

“I am very concerned that … there have been misrepresentations to the court,” Davis said.

The judge had expressed his displeasure at the late disclosure regarding Murdoch and became even more perturbed Wednesday when he was told that Fox also did not reveal the recordings made by a former producer for Bartiromo. The recordings were of conversations the host had with Giuliani and Powell before and after her show. Their existence surfaced in a lawsuit the former producer, Abby Grossberg, has filed against Fox alleging that the network’s attorneys forced her to give misleading deposition testimony in an effort to protect the company in the defamation case.

In one pre-show conversation on Nov. 8, 2020, just days after the presidential election, Bartiromo asked Giuliani whether he had information about Dominion’s software, which some people had alleged could be manipulated.

“That’s a little harder. It’s being analyzed right now,” Giuliani responded.

A week later, Giuliani said on Bartiromo’s show that the software had been developed by a company founded by Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez and had been used to cheat in elections in South America.

Colorado-based Dominion alleges that Fox damaged the company by repeatedly airing false allegations that its machines and the software they used rigged the 2020 presidential election to prevent Trump’s reelection. Records produced as part of the lawsuit show many executives and hosts didn’t believe the claims, but aired them anyway.

There was no indication that the recent developments would delay the trial, which is scheduled to start Thursday with jury selection, but they dealt additional blows to Fox in a lawsuit that already has embarrassed the network. In part, it has revealed how Fox used the false election claims to win back viewers who were angered after the network correctly called Arizona for Joe Biden on election night.

The judge on Wednesday said he was considering asking a special master to investigate actions taken by Fox attorneys after they had certified to the court in December that they had complied with their obligations to produce documents. That could include Fox failing to disclose the Grossberg recordings and a Bartiromo email.

Dominion attorney Davida Brook told the judge that Dominion only recently learned that Powell had forwarded to Bartiromo an email Powell received in November 2020 from a woman who described a wide range of conspiracy theories, including those involving claims of election fraud.

In her deposition, Bartiromo said she didn’t know if she even saw the email. “It’s not anything I looked at or considered real,” she said under oath.

But on Wednesday, the judge was shown an email confirming that Bartiromo not only read Powell’s email, but apparently discussed its contents with Trump’s son, Eric Trump, and sent a reply to Powell: “I just spoke to Eric & told him you gave very imp info,” Bartiromo wrote Powell.

Davis said he would allow Dominion to question Bartiromo under oath again, at Fox’s expense, though there was no immediate indication from Dominion that it would do so.

The judge said he also was likely to ask a special master to investigate how Fox attorneys handled the issue of Rupert Murdoch’s role at Fox News.

Fox Corp. had asserted since Dominion filed its lawsuit in 2021 that Murdoch had no official role at Fox News. In its filings, it had listed Fox News’ officers as Jay Wallace, Joe Dorrego and Suzanne Scott, who is the network’s chief executive officer. But on Sunday, Fox disclosed to Dominion’s attorneys that Murdoch also is “executive chair” at Fox News.

The judge Wednesday ordered Fox attorneys to collect and preserve all internal communications regarding the matter. Earlier in the day, he denied Dominion’s request to hold separate trials based on the new information about Murdoch’s roles — one for Fox News and another for the network’s parent company.

Murdoch’s role and those of other top Fox executives are at the heart of Dominion’s defamation case.

421,Norway expels 15 Russian diplomats suspected of spying,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Norway’s government said Thursday that it was expelling 15 Russian diplomats from the country, saying they were suspected of spying while working at the Russian Embassy in Oslo.

Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said the move was “an important measure to counter and reduce the scope of Russian intelligence activities in Norway, and thereby secure our national interests.”

The Russians declared persona non grata “must leave Norway within a short time,” Huitfeldt said, adding: “We will not grant visas to intelligence officers who apply for a visa to Norway.”

The minister declined to say whether the government was acting in response to a specific incident, referring questions to Norway’s domestic security agency PST for details. The government said the activities of the expelled diplomats were “incompatible with their diplomatic status.”

“We are not talking about regular diplomats, but intelligence officers under diplomatic cover. Their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests,” Huitfeldt said.

Norwegian newspaper VG described Thursday’s expulsions as the most the Scandinavian country has ordered at one time involving Russian diplomats.

The Russian Embassy in Norway called the Norwegian government’s decision “an extremely unfriendly step” and promised Moscow would take “retaliatory measures,” which in such a case typically involve in-kind expulsions.

Huitfeldt reacted during an afternoon news conference, saying: “Russia has no reason to respond. We have Norwegian diplomats stationed in Russia, but none of them are undercover intelligence officers.”

She called Russia “an unpredictable neighbor” and “many European countries in the past year have expelled hundreds of Russian intelligence officers under diplomatic cover.”

At the same time, she stressed that the government in Oslo wants “normal diplomatic relations with Russia, and that Russian diplomats are welcome in Norway”

“We do not want people who claim they are diplomats and who are actually are intelligence officers,” she said. “We cannot accept that.”

NATO-member Norway has a 198 kilometer-long (123-mile) border with Russia in the Arctic.

VG said that including the expelled diplomats, Russia had about 40 people working at its missions in Norway, which include the embassy in Oslo and consulates in Kirkenes and Barentsburg.

Barentsburg, located on the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, is a Russian coal-mining town of about 500 people. Under a 1920 treaty, Norway has sovereignty over the archipelago, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) north of the Norwegian mainland, but other signatory countries have rights to explore its natural resources.

A year ago, Norway expelled three Russian diplomats it identified as intelligence officers.

A man whom the Norwegian Police Security Service alleged used a false name and identity while actually working for one of Russia’s intelligence services also was arrested last year. He is awaiting trial in Norway.",0
422,"1st moon crew in 50 years includes woman, Black astronaut","NASA on Monday named the four astronauts who will fly around the moon late next year, including the first woman and the first African American assigned to a lunar mission.

The first moon crew in 50 years — three Americans and one Canadian — was introduced during a ceremony in Houston, home to the nation’s astronauts as well as Mission Control.

The four astronauts will be the first to fly NASA’s Orion capsule, launching atop a Space Launch System rocket from Kennedy Space Center no earlier than late 2024. They will not land or even go into lunar orbit, but rather fly around the moon and head straight back to Earth, a prelude to a lunar landing by two others a year later.

The mission’s commander, Reid Wiseman, will be joined by Victor Glover, an African American naval aviator; Christina Koch, who holds the world record for the longest spaceflight by a woman; and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen, a former fighter pilot and the crew’s lone space rookie. Wiseman, Glover and Koch have all lived on the International Space Station. All four are in their 40s.

“This is a big day. We have a lot to celebrate and it’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,” Glover said.

This is the first moon crew to include someone from outside the U. S. — and the first crew in NASA’s new moon program named Artemis after the twin sister of mythology’s Apollo. Late last year, an empty Orion capsule flew to the moon and back in a long-awaited dress rehearsal.

“Am I excited? Absolutely,” Koch said to cheers from the crowd of schoolchildren, politicians and others. “But my real question is: ‘Are you excited?’ ” she said to more cheers.

The Canadian Space Agency snagged a seat because of its contributions of big robotic arms on NASA’s space shuttles and the space station. One is also planned for the moon project.

Hansen said he’s grateful that Canada is included in the flight.

“We are going to the moon together. Let’s go!” he said.

During Apollo, NASA sent 24 astronauts to the moon from 1968 through 1972. Twelve of them landed. All were military-trained male test pilots except for Apollo 17′s Harrison Schmitt, a geologist who closed out that moonlanding era alongside the late Gene Cernan.

Provided this next 10-day moonshot goes well, NASA aims to land two astronauts on the moon by 2025 or so.

NASA picked from 41 active astronauts for its first Artemis crew. Canada had four candidates. Almost all of them took part in Monday’s ceremony at Johnson Space Center’s Ellington Field, a pep rally of sorts that ended with Wiseman leading the crowd in a chant.

Congratulations streamed in from retired astronauts, including Apollo 11’s Buzz Aldrin and Scott Kelly, the first American to spend close to a year in space. “Huge risks, huge commitment, eternal benefits for all. What a crew!” tweeted Chris Hadfield, the first Canadian commander of the space station a decade ago who performed David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” from orbit.

President Joe Biden spoke with the four astronauts and their families on Sunday. In a tweet Monday, Biden said the mission “will inspire the next generation of explorers, and show every child — in America, in Canada, and across the world — that if they can dream it, they can be it.”

423,"Decade on, Boston Marathon bombing echoes","BOSTON (AP) — She didn’t even know the Boston Marathon was going on when she wandered out for a walk along Boylston Street. Nor could she understand why someone would run 26.2 miles for “a statement necklace and a banana.”

The ballroom dancer was standing next to the second of two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded among the spectators watching the finish of the 2013 race. Three were killed and nearly 300 others wounded. Seventeen people lost limbs in the blast. Haslet was one of them.

She relearned to walk with a prosthetic left leg and vowed to return to dancing. She also set a goal that surprised friends and family who knew her as someone who didn’t like to sweat in public: She would return to the course, this time as a runner.

Haslet completed the race for the first time in 2016, and she is back in the field for Monday’s 127th Boston Marathon as the city, the country and fans of the cherished sporting event mark 10 years since the finish-line attacks. In the decade since, the streets and sidewalks have been repaired, and memorials at the sites of the explosions remember those who died: Krystle Campbell, Lu Lingzi, Martin Richard.

And, for many, the race itself is an important part.

Bombing survivors with no previous interest in distance running make it a bucket-list goal; for others, friends and family enter on their behalf. Doctors and first responders and others affected by the attacks are also drawn back to the race on the Massachusetts holiday of Patriots’ Day that commemorates the start of the Revolutionary War.

“We would say in the Navy, ‘Like a fire in the gut,’” says Eric Goralnick, an emergency medicine physician who helped treat the wounded in 2013 and ran the following year.

“I just felt it in my gut. It was something I had to do,” Goralnick says. “I wanted to feel like this is our city, and this is our event, and it’s the people’s marathon. And I wanted to participate in it and demonstrate that we’re not going to live in fear of terrorists.”

The Boston Marathon might look like a sporting event up in front, where the world’s fittest athletes compete for a prize purse approaching $1 million and the right to claim one of sports’ most treasured titles.

But it isn’t just a race.

Or, at least, not just one race.

Following the elite runners from Hopkinton to Boston’s Back Bay on the third Monday in April are 30,000 others who are not in it to win it, or maybe not even to achieve a personal best. They are happy simply to endure, to raise some money for charity, to check a box on some emotional or athletic to-do list.

“That’s the cool thing about these races, that everybody on the start line has a story,” 2018 women’s winner Des Linden says. “That’s so inspirational. And I think so many of those stories came out of that, the bombing year.

“It’s very moving,” she says. “And I think it is to the point: We’re going to get up, and keep pressing forward.”

Since the bombing, the field also includes many who were not marathoners — or even runners — but were drawn to the race as part of the healing process. The Boston Athletic Association waives qualifying for those who were “personally and profoundly impacted” by the attack, including the wounded, their families, and the charities associated with the victims and survivors. This year, 264 One Fund participants will participate.

Dave Fortier, who was hit by shrapnel from one of the bombs, was planning to be a “one and done” when he entered in 2013 as a charity runner on behalf of a friend with leukemia. He has returned every year since.

“It became a ‘take back the finish line’ kind of a piece,” Fortier says. “You’re here to say: ‘Not me. Not us.’”

Fortier, who created the One World Foundation to help connect survivors of terrorist attacks and mass shootings with peers from other traumatic events, has another reason for running again in 2014.

“I don’t remember finishing the first one,” he said.

Bill and Denise Richard were steps away from one of the backpack bombs when it exploded. Their son, Martin, 8, died. Jane, his sister, lost her left leg. Denise Richard was blinded in one eye. Bill Richard’s eardrums were blown out and he was hit by shrapnel in his legs.

Henry Richard, Martin’s brother, returned to Boylston Street to run the race in 2022, raising his arms in triumph as he crossed the finish line and then collapsing into the arms of his family. He was presented with his finisher’s medal by 2014 winner Meb Keflezighi.

“It was definitely a personal accomplishment that I thought about for a very long time,” says Henry Richard, who is 21 now and running again this year. “It was a very special day for myself and for my family to finally watch me cross the finish line. I waited years to do it, and I’m glad that it happened and I can continue to do it.”

Keflezighi’s victory a year after the bombing ended a three-decade championship drought for the Americans and a year of anxiety in anticipation of the race’s return. Fears of another attack loomed. Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans struggled to find the middle ground between making everyone feel safe and turning the event into an “armed camp.”

And he knew he would not be able to run in the race, snapping a 25-year streak.

“It’s tough to watch. But I knew I had to,” he says in his memorabilia-filled office at Boston College, where he is now the police chief. “I knew my responsibility was putting that race back together.”

Chris Tarpey entered in 2014 when the BAA invited back those affected by the attacks and has returned every year until the pandemic broke his streak in 2020. Each time, he raised his middle finger when he passed the sporting goods store where one of the bombs sent shrapnel into his right knee — his own message to the bombers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

“I say, ‘Screw you, Tsarnaev brothers,’” Tarpey says. “I could never understand. What was their point? What was their message? What was their cause? What were they trying to prove?”

Answers have proven especially hard to come by for Tarpey: His daughter, Liz, died in Hawaii in a hiking accident two months after the attack. “I think of the marathon bombing is minor compared to what happened with my daughter,” he says.

But both taught him the same lesson: Everything can change in an instant.

424,"Mario, Mariah, Madonna added to National Recording Registry","WASHINGTON (AP) — Mario, Madonna and Mariah have entered the national audio canon.

Madonna’s star-making 1984 album “Like a Virgin,” Mariah Carey’s 1994 holiday perennial “All I Want For Christmas Is You” and the original 1985 theme from Super Mario Bros. are now in the U. S. National Recording Registry as part of “the defining sounds of the nation’s history and culture,” the Library of Congress announced Wednesday.

In all, 25 albums, singles and other sound artifacts spanning more than a century are being inducted into the registry, from the first known recording of mariachi music in 1908 and 1909 by Cuarteto Coculense, to 2012′s “Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra” by composer Ellen Taaffe Zwilich.

The Super Mario Bros. music, officially known as the “Ground Theme,” written by young Nintendo composer Koji Kondo, becomes the first music from a video game to enter the registry, which called it in a news release “the most recognizable video game theme in history.” The tune has appeared in countless Mario-related incarnations, including in the new megahit “ Super Mario Bros. Movie.”

Queen Latifah becomes the first female rapper with a recording in the registry with the inclusion of her 1989 album “All Hail the Queen,” whose songs include the feminist anthem “Ladies First.”

Other full albums getting recognition include 1970′s “Déjà Vu” by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, 1983′s “Synchronicity” by the Police, and 1985′s “Black Codes (From the Underground)” by jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.

Other singles making the list include Bobby Gentry’s “Ode to Billie Joe” (1967), John Lennon’s “Imagine” (1971), Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” (1971), John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads” (1971), and Jimmy Buffett’s “Margaritaville” (1977).

Those recordings are joined by a pair of 1980s standards: “Flashdance...What a Feeling” by Irene Cara (1983) and “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” by Eurythmics (1983).

The inductees include two non-musical entries, astronomer Carl Sagan’s recording of his book about humanity’s place in the universe, “Pale Blue Dot,” and NBC radio reporter Dorothy Thompson’s commentaries and analysis from Europe during the runup to World War II in 1939.

The Library of Congress selects the titles for preservation for their cultural and historic importance to the American soundscape.

Artists with recordings added to the registry in recent years include Janet Jackson, Louis Armstrong and Dr. Dre.",0
425,Michigan researchers find 1914 shipwrecks in Lake Superior,"CHICAGO (AP) — Michigan researchers have found the wreckage of two ships that disappeared into Lake Superior in 1914 and hope the discovery will lead them to a third that sank at the same time, killing nearly 30 people aboard the trio of lumber-shipping vessels.

The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society announced the discoveries this month after confirming details with other researchers. Ric Mixter, a board member of the society and a maritime historian, called witnessing the discoveries “a career highlight.”

“It not only solved a chapter in the nation’s darkest day in lumber history, but also showcased a team of historians who have dedicated their lives towards making sure these stories aren’t forgotten,” Mixter said.

The vessels owned by the Edward Hines Lumber Company sank into the ice-cold lake on Nov. 18, 1914, when a storm swept through as they moved lumber from Baraga, Michigan, to Tonawanda, New York. The steamship C. F. Curtis was towing the schooner barges Selden E. Marvin and Annie M. Peterson; all 28 people aboard were killed.

The society’s team found the wreck of the Curtis during the summer of 2021 and the Marvin a year later within a few miles of the first discovery. The organization operates a museum in Whitefish Point and regularly runs searches for shipwrecks, aiming to tell “the lost history of all the Great Lakes” with a focus on Lake Superior, said Corey Adkins, the society’s content and communications director.

“One of the things that makes us proud when we discover these things is helping piece the puzzle together of what happened to these 28 people,” Adkins said. “It’s been 109 years, but maybe there are still some family members that want to know what happened. We’re able to start answering those questions.”

Both wrecks were discovered about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Grand Marais, Michigan, farther into the lake than the 1914 accounts suggested the ships sank, Adkins said. There was also damage to the Marvin’s bow and the Curtis’ stern, making researchers wonder whether a collision contributed, he said.

“Those are all questions we want to consider when we go back out this summer,” Adkins said.

Video footage from the Curtis wreckage showed the maintained hull of the steamship, its wheel, anchor, boiler and still shining gauges — all preserved by Lake Superior’s cold waters, along with other artifacts.

Another recording captured the team’s jubilant cheers as the words “Selden E. Marvin” on the hull came into clear view for the first time on a video feed shot by an underwater drone at the barge wreck site.

“We’re the first human eyes to see it since 1914, since World War I,” one team member mused.",0
426,"Jeremy Renner attends premiere, months after snowplow crush","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jeremy Renner attended the premiere for his new series Tuesday, capping a remarkable recovery less than four months after the “Avengers” star was nearly killed in a snowplow accident.

Renner was surrounded by family and supporters at the “Rennervations” premiere in Los Angeles, where he posed for photos and did interviews, at times making use of a cane and a knee scooter. At one point he flashed photographers a thumbs up sign while moving down the carpet.

Renner was crushed by his 7-ton snowplow on New Year’s Day while trying to help free a relative’s car at his Nevada home. The actor has said he broke numerous bones and suffered a collapsed lung and pierced liver in the accident.

“Rennervations,” which premieres on Disney+ on Wednesday, follows Renner as he transforms large vehicles into community spaces for young people in India, Mexico, Chicago and Nevada. The purposes range from serving as a mobile music studio to a water filtration truck for a community in India.

Renner said his aim was to give young people access to things they might not already have and present opportunities they might not know existed.

Renner wrote the theme song for the show, something he did while working on another show.

“I use music and piano to write songs and use it like therapy for me,” he said.

Construction and music have been creative outlets for Renner, who is best known for playing the superhero Hawkeye in the Marvel “Avengers” films and his own spin-off TV series.

Marvel co-star Anthony Mackie appears in the show, and Renner said the secret to their friendship is they “laugh a lot.”

Renner, a two-time Oscar nominee, told Diane Sawyer in an interview that aired that while he thought he might die from his injuries, he refused to be “haunted” by the accident.

427,"Fishing regulators need more transparency, ocean groups say","MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — Some regional fisheries management organizations that were set up by the United Nations to measure and conserve fish populations — but are difficult to hold to account — need to be more transparent about how they make their rules and regulations if fish species are to be protected and maintained for people reliant on healthy fish stocks for their livelihoods, conservation agencies and fishing industry players say.

The 50-some regional fisheries management organizations worldwide bring together local, coastal states and bigger international players to regulate how companies and countries can fish in waters worldwide in a way that best conserves populations of fish and other ocean species based on scientific evidence.

For years, these regional regulators have been accused of undemocratic practices that favor large, industrial fishers but now several conservation groups are banding together to renew calls for a culture change.

A coalition of conservationists and market players like Accountability. Fish, the Ocean Foundation, the Global Tuna Alliance and others have endorsed more open access to fisheries organizations’ proceedings so that more members of the public can participate in conservation efforts.

The U. N. Food and Agriculture Organization — the parent body of regional fisheries management organizations — said it “supports and promotes transparency in fisheries and notes that transparency in ocean governance is becoming a greater priority in global and regional processes.”

For local and non-commercial fishers who rely on well-managed fish stocks, it’s unclear if more open measures will make a difference.

“I only hear of meetings on fisheries, but I have no idea what it is they discuss there. I have never been invited,” said Kassim Abdalla, a fisher on Kenya’s coast, who’s part of a cooperative group of fishers. “In any case it is always a meeting of unequals. How can I compete with the well-financed fishing fleets from the developed nations and all I have is an outrigger canoe?”

The concern among environmentalists and smaller-scale fishers is that large fleets are permitted by fishery organizations to use practices that are only accessible to vessels big enough to go far into the open ocean, depleting fish stocks for those more confined to the coasts or forcing them to travel into choppy, more dangerous waters their smaller boats aren’t fit for.

Many industrial fishing fleets rely on a highly-effective scooping method called purse seining — a two-kilometer-long (1.2-mile) net positioned around schools of fish by a smaller support vessel, explained Frederic Manach, a marine scientist with the ocean conservation group Bloom. “The seine is then closed from below with a sliding system, allowing the entire school to be caught” which makes it difficult to sustain populations, he said.

The European Union, a prominent actor in eight regional fisheries management organizations worldwide, including Abdalla’s Indian Ocean, has been accused of using these fish-aggregating devices as well as pressuring coastal states in order to secure privileged access to regional fishery management organizations.

The EU Commission denied the claims, saying the bloc is not suppressing Global South countries or other actors for more favorable access. It also previously said that it would stop using fish-aggregating devices if the science backed up a ban, adding that “it is essential that science is the backbone” of decision-making at regulatory bodies.

How its decided how much fish each party is able to catch is what fishery regulatory bodies need to be more open about, said Manach.

“There is absolutely no transparency regarding how quotas are allocated and who gets them,” he said.

Ryan Orgera, the global director of Accountability. Fish, an organization that calls for greater awareness in fishery management said that’s the result of the makeup of regulatory bodies, made up mostly of industrial fishers.

“We seek to reduce the power of industrial fishers in regional fisheries and balance out the space with market players and non-governmental organizations,” including artisanal and small boat fishers, Orgera said.

Regulations for the high seas — the world’s deep oceans — and the marine life that lives there have for a long time been patchwork and it’s been hard to reach a global consensus on how best to protect them.

Then last month, the long-awaited worldwide framework to protect the high seas was finally approved. The U. N. high seas treaty will create a new body to manage conservation of ocean life globally and establish marine protected areas in the world’s oceans.

But even with the treaty, Orgera said, “if industrial fishers are given a green light by the fisheries management organizations to overfish for, say five years, the effects on the oceans could become irreversible.”

The hope for conservation groups is that even before the creation of marine protected areas in the oceans, which could take a few years, fishery bodies involve more and varied stakeholders — no matter the size of their fleet — in open discussion and decisions about conserving fish populations.

Abdalla, the Kenyan fisher, said knowledge-sharing programs in other regions of the world, like China, the Seychelles and among Pacific Ocean states are a better model for those reliant on the same fish stocks to communicate and preserve populations.

Orgera said the key is transparency.

“No nation on earth benefits from mismanaged oceans, especially developing states,” said Orgera. He added that more openness can make sure that “societies have access to what happens to our collective resources.” ___

428,Cavs' defensive stopper Okoro likely to return vs. Knicks,"INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) — The Cleveland Cavaliers will likely have their defensive stopper back for their first-round playoff matchup against the New York Knicks.

Isaac Okoro, who missed the final six games of the regular season with a sore left knee, took part in some contact portions of practice on Thursday and it appears he’ll be ready for Game 1 on Saturday.

Okoro is Cleveland’s best perimeter defender, and his presence will be more needed than ever against a New York team that likes to get players in offensive isolation matchups — especially on the wings.

Coach J. B. Bickerstaff remained vague about Okoro’s availability, saying only “we’ll see” when asked if he was encouraged by his progress the past two days.

However, Bickerstaff was very clear about what the 22-year-old small forward does for the Cavs, who are one of the league’s top defensive teams.

“There’s an energy that he supplies the group when he’s doing Isaac things, and you go back and just watch film and you marvel at the way he can just keep himself in position and is always in the play,” Bickerstaff said. “There’s no screening action. There’s no misdirection that can get him out of position and it’s fun to watch and he’s elite at it.”

Okoro got in some extra shooting practice Thursday as the Cavs had a lighter workout than the previous day in hopes of staying fresh for what they hope is a lengthy postseason run.

Okoro last played on March 26, when he was on the floor for just nine minutes as the Cavs beat Houston to lock up their first playoff spot since 2018. The team has been somewhat secretive about Okoro’s injury.

Okoro missed the March 31 game against the Knicks — New York star Julius Randle was also out with a sprained ankle, and his status for the series remains unknown — and Knicks guard Jalen Brunson erupted for a career-high 48 points.

The Cavs are counting on the 6-foot-5 Okoro to at least slow Brunson.

“It’s one of Isaac’s strengths defending a guy like that,” Bickerstaff said. “Obviously, Brunson is a heck of a player. He’s extremely talented and has proven to be clutch in the brightest moments, but those are the challenges that Isaac accepts and he loves.”

And his teammates love what Okoro does for them defensively.

“It makes it easier, especially in pick and rolls,” said center Jarrett Allen, who also missed the recent loss to the Knicks. “He’s usually guarding the guy that handles the ball the most, so it’s not like the guy is going to blow past him.

“It’s not like he’s going to give the guy an open lane to the basket. So that helps me be able to relax more and rely that it’s going to be a 2-on-2 defense.”",0

430,US judicial nominee seeks to reverse senator's opposition,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi prosecutor is asking one of his home-state senators to reconsider her opposition to his nomination to become a federal district judge.

Scott Colom, who is district attorney in four counties, refutes many of the reasons Republican U. S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith stated for opposing President Joe Biden’s nomination of him to the bench, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported.

“I hope you will reconsider your views about my nomination,” Colom wrote in the April 10 letter. “If there are other issues of concern to you, I would welcome the opportunity to address those, either in person or on a call.”

U. S. District Judge Michael P. Mills announced last year that he will take senior status, creating the post to which Biden nominated Colom. Mississippi has two federal districts — northern and southern. If Colom were confirmed by the Senate, he would be the second Black judge in the northern district.

A Senate tradition requires senators from a nominee’s home state to submit “blue slips” if they approve of the nominee. The Senate Judiciary Committee typically does not hold a confirmation hearing without receiving a blue slip from both senators in the nominee’s state.

Hyde-Smith has said she opposes Colom’s nomination because progressive organizations supported his initial campaign for district attorney.

George Soros, a New York billionaire who backs some criminal justice reform efforts, gave money to Mississippi Safety and Justice, a political action committee that supported Colom’s 2015 race for district attorney. Soros did not contribute directly to Colom’s campaign.

“I never requested these funds from Mr. Soros,” Colom wrote to Hyde-Smith. “I did not know the money would be contributed — and did not even learn of the contributions until l read about them in my hometown paper.”

Hyde-Smith has said one of her reasons for blocking Colom’s nomination is because of concerns about his opposition to “legislation to protect female athletes.” Colom signed a letter with other prosecutors in June 2021 condemning efforts to criminalize gender-affirming care for transgender people.

“This statement that I signed did not comment on legislation specifically related to participation in athletics,” Colom wrote to Hyde-Smith. “Moreover, I would note that if confirmed as a judge, any views I had about policy matters would be irrelevant to my daily work, and I would faithfully apply binding Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent to the cases that came before me.”

Colom is the district attorney in Lowndes, Oktibbeha, Clay and Noxubee counties. He is the first Black prosecutor in those counties, defeating the longtime incumbent Forrest Allgood in 2015. Colom was unopposed when he won a second term in 2019.

About 20 crime victims or relatives of crime victims in Colom’s district wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination, according to documents reviewed by the Daily Journal.

“Crime is not tolerated in his district and victims do not continue to pay a price under his watch,” Sharicka Gray wrote in one letter.",0
431,German climate demo didn't cause cyclist death,"BERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors said Thursday they have determined that climate protesters weren’t responsible for the death in October of a cyclist after their road blockade caused a delay in the arrival of a rescue vehicle at an accident scene.

The Oct. 31 incident in Berlin fueled controversy over the tactics of the Last Generation group, whose actions also have included throwing mashed potatoes at a Claude Monet painting in an art museum and disrupting traffic at airports. Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged activists to show “creativity” and avoid endangering others.

Berlin’s fire service said at the time that blockades resulted in officers with special rescue equipment getting stuck in traffic as they rushed to help a seriously injured cyclist who got stuck under a cement mixer.

Prosecutors in the German capital said Thursday that they looked into whether the death of the cyclist could have been prevented if it hadn’t been for a delay caused by two Last Generation activists accused of causing the partial closure of a highway by hanging banners from a traffic sign and gluing themselves to it.

They found that the blockade did cause an eight-minute delay to the arrival of a rescue vehicle. But they said that wasn’t significant to the cyclist’s fate as a doctor had already determined that using the vehicle’s equipment likely would have worsened the victim’s condition further and another course of action made more sense.

An autopsy later found that the cyclist had already suffered such severe injuries in the accident that her life couldn’t have been saved, prosecutors said in a statement.

They said that the activists have been charged with coercion and resisting enforcement officers over the protest, but they won’t face charges related to the injury or death of the cyclist.

The prosecutors’ decision came as climate activists gear up for a new round of protests in Berlin in the coming days and weeks. They point to what they say is the government’s failure to properly address the threat of climate change.",0
432,"Dem, GOP convention picks show Midwest's political influence","CHICAGO (AP) — Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 by breaking up the famed electoral “blue wall,” snatching the Midwestern battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, along with Pennsylvania, from Democrats. He lost the White House four years later when those same states flipped to Joe Biden.

Both parties are already zeroing in on the Midwest ahead of next year’s presidential election, each choosing to hold their national conventions in the region. Republicans will have their event in July 2024 in Milwaukee, the largest city in the swing state of Wisconsin. Democrats announced Tuesday that they would hold theirs the following month in Chicago, just 90 miles away, in solidly blue Illinois.

In picking Chicago over other finalists New York and Atlanta, the Democratic National Committee said, the party was “returning to the Midwest, a critical Democratic stronghold” and called Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota part of the “blue wall” crucial to Biden’s 2020 victory, as well as his party’s success in last fall’s midterm elections.

That overlooked Trump’s Midwestern success four years prior, but the DNC also noted that Chicago embodied the “formidable coalition” of voters that will be vital to Biden in his expected 2024 reelection campaign.

“We’re seeing the importance of those states and the recognition by the Democratic Party that we must win them,” said Democratic Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker, who was a leading advocate for Chicago’s bid.

The Midwest wasn’t the only part of the country that boosted Biden in 2020. He flipped two Sun Belt states, Arizona and Georgia, and captured Pennsylvania, which is often considered part of the “blue wall” but is not located in the Midwest. Still, the selection by both parties of Midwestern convention sites shows the region’s enduring political importance — even though it’s no guarantee of support.

“The Midwest is the place to be,” said Cam Savage, a Republican strategist who has worked with top GOP elected officials around the region. “You’re looking at Pennsylvania to Wisconsin — and more or less everything in between — as key battleground areas in any national election these days.”

It was the second election cycle in a row that Democrats looked to the Midwest for their convention. In 2020, the party selected Milwaukee to host but ended up holding it virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic.

This year, it was up to Biden to pick a site, and he said Chicago would be a “showcase” for his administration’s overseeing post-pandemic economic growth and falling unemployment.

The nation’s third-largest city, Chicago is also heavily pro-union, demonstrating Biden’s commitment to organized labor, which played a key role in helping him clinch the Democratic primary and presidency in 2020.

“Atlanta could have been strategic as well. But it doesn’t allow the party to really show off all of the principles that it is supposedly standing for, and they can do that in Chicago,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. She signed a letter to the DNC from top labor groups and union workers urging them to choose Chicago.

Pritzker stressed his state’s strong defense of abortion rights as an important factor. Other Democrats worried about Georgia’s Republican-controlled Legislature and the state’s relaxed gun laws. That’s despite Chicago being plagued by gun violence, potentially exposing Democrats to GOP attacks about rising crime rates in cities around the country.

Lisa Hernandez, the Illinois Democratic Party chair, said that the bid went beyond Chicago and her state, calling the convention site the “gateway to the Midwest’s blue bastion.” Her party noted that Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota voted Democratic in every presidential election but 2016 over the last 30 years, and that each state reelected its Democratic governor last fall.

Organizers of Chicago’s bid also argued to White House officials from the start that it represented the Midwest as a whole. That hasn’t always been a positive for Democrats, though.

Few places better illustrate the Midwest’s ever-shifting electoral loyalties than Wisconsin, where both Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson won reelection in last fall’s midterm elections.

Democrats, meanwhile, are still celebrating Judge Janet Protasiewicz’s victory last week in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, which gave liberal justices control of the court for the first time in 15 years. They’ll likely have the opportunity to counter an 1849 statewide ban on abortion triggered by the U. S. Supreme Court’s overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision, as well as congressional district maps that had favored Republicans.

That same night, however, Republican Dan Knodl won an open seat in the Wisconsin state Senate, giving the GOP a supermajority in the chamber.

“Wisconsin is always going to be 50/50, right down the line,” said Democratic strategist Pete Giangreco, who worked on Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns and is advising 2024 U. S. Senate candidates in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. “But you’ve got to have the blue wall first, or the Georgias and the Arizonas don’t matter.”

Giangreco, who also was part of Protasiewicz’s victorious campaign, noted that progressive Brandon Johnson’s win over a moderate Democratic rival in Chicago’s recent mayor’s race may have boosted the city’s convention bid.

Johnson, a former Chicago Teachers Union organizer, was endorsed by progressive leaders including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The 47-year-old, who is Black, won by building a multiracial coalition that included young people and labor unions, and he brings a new sense of optimism to the city — a combination of factors that Democrats need to recreate in 2024, Giangreco said.

“It’s very clear Brandon brought younger people into activism, into the electorate,” Giangreco said. “It certainly didn’t hurt our chances at all that you have a mayor of the city who’s dynamic and young and part of a movement that is an important part of our party.”",0
433,"Gulf of Mexico oil worse for climate than thought, study","Offshore oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico are releasing far more climate-changing methane than official estimates show, according to a new study published Monday.

Using data collected from aircraft in part, climate scientists found the additional methane coming from oil and gas platforms in the Gulf region raises their carbon intensity — the amount of climate-changing gas per unit of energy in the fuel — to twice as much as estimated by U. S. agencies like the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The study is published in PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Reductions in both methane and carbon dioxide emissions are essential to lessen the future severity of climate change, the study notes.

“You don’t have to travel halfway around the world to find unusually high emissions in oil and gas fields,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist who was not involved in the study. “It’s happening right here in our backyards.”

Other climate scientists who were not involved in the study praised it for its approach.

“This study represents a novel and thoughtful assessment of the climate impact of oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico,” said Riley Duren, a research scientist at the University of Arizona who leads Carbon Mapper, a group pioneering accessible and transparent information about where greenhouse gases are being released. “In particular, the authors have demonstrated the importance of jointly quantifying methane emissions from leakage and venting and carbon dioxide emissions from combustion.”

Eric A. Kort, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan and co-author of the study, said the majority of the methane emissions researchers found were wafting from oil and gas operations in shallow waters, where the oldest oil platforms are. The problem was most acute where energy companies are mostly going after oil and aren’t that interested in the methane gas that lies underground with it, so simply release it into the air.

“It was easier to build platforms in shallow water and drill in shallow waters. Now there’s opportunity to extend out into quite deep waters,” Kort said.

But this gas has a powerful effect on the climate and is responsible for a significant amount of the climate change we are already experiencing.

The oil platforms out in deeper water emitted much less methane per unit of energy.

The findings could have implications for future offshore oil and gas operations as the federal government prepares to lease more areas in the Gulf for drilling. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a provision that mandates the federal government offer extensive new offshore leases in federal water for oil and gas drilling if it wants to lease for offshore solar and wind energy.

Kort said that the findings can help policymakers or federal and state agencies compare the climate impact of shallow versus deepwater drilling, to guide where they offer leases.

“It’s very clear from our results that expanding production in shallow waters, the way it’s been done historically, would have disproportionately high climate impacts,” he said.

Alan M. Gorchov Negron, another climate scientist at the University of Michigan and study co-author, said there are ten more lease sales scheduled for waters in the Gulf of Mexico over the next five years.

“This question of the climate impact of future production will return,” he said. “So it’s still relevant to future lease sale climate impact statements.”

They looked at recent emissions coming from these operations and previous emissions surveys and inventories and found that over 1.3 billion pounds (.6 tergrams) of methane a year is not being accounted for.

434,US displays firepower in combat drills with Philippines,"FORT MAGSAYSAY, Philippines (AP) — U. S. and Filipino forces on Thursday blasted vehicles with anti-tank missiles in combat-readiness drills in the Philippines that are part of a show of American firepower that has alarmed China.

The long-time treaty allies are holding their largest joint military exercises called Balikatan — Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder — in decades. They involve about 17,600 military personnel and will feature live-fire maneuvers, including a ship-sinking rocket attack and beach assaults to simulate retaking an island near the disputed South China Sea.

In a gunnery range at Fort Magsaysay, a northern Philippine training camp for Filipino special forces, American and Filipino troops fired Javelin guided missiles toward three target vehicles simulating a battle zone. The missiles streaked at a low altitude for more than half a kilometer (half a mile) toward their targets and exploded in a fireball that shook the ground.

“This is what it looks like when the U. S. and Philippine militaries come together, train together,” U.S. Army Pacific commander Gen. Charles Flynn said.

“What you’re witnessing here today is really operationalizing everything that our political leaders are talking about from integrated deterrence to campaigning to building an enduring advantage,” Flynn told journalists invited to witness the drills.

U. S. troops also displayed other weapons including sniper rifles with night-vision scopes that could hit targets more than a kilometer (half a mile) away with high precision, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, which are rocket and missile launchers that have been used by Ukrainian forces against Russia.

Philippine army chief Lt. Gen. Romeo Brawner said the Philippine military wants to acquire Javelins and HIMARS from the United States under a special foreign military sales arrangement that is part of efforts to modernize the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

It’s uncertain when the Philippines can secure such weapons while Ukraine presses the U. S. and other Western nations for more military assistance, he said.

“These weapon systems are relatively more affordable for us as we shift to external defense,” Brawner said.

Last month, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office last June, said the Philippine military’s focus is shifting from decades of battling communist and Muslim insurgents to external defense to ensure the protection of the country’s territory as disputes with China over the contested South China Sea persist.

Marcos also approved a wider U. S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating batches of American forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That’s a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that an American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.

Efforts under Marcos to boost the territorial defenses have dovetailed with the Biden administration’s bid to strengthen alliances to better counter China, including in a possible confrontation over Taiwan, a self-governed island democracy that Beijing claims as its own.

China has strongly opposed the expanded American military presence in the Philippines, which allows U. S. forces to establish military staging grounds and surveillance outposts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan and in western Philippine provinces facing the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.

On Wednesday, China warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills in the Philippines should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said such military cooperation “should not target any third party and should be conducive to regional peace and stability.”

435,The US leads the world in weather catastrophes. Here's why,"The United States is Earth’s punching bag for nasty weather.

Blame geography for the U. S. getting hit by stronger, costlier, more varied and frequent extreme weather than anywhere on the planet, several experts said. Two oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky Mountains, jutting peninsulas like Florida, clashing storm fronts and the jet stream combine to naturally brew the nastiest of weather.

That’s only part of it. Nature dealt the United States a bad hand, but people have made it much worse by what, where and how we build, several experts told The Associated Press.

Then add climate change, and “buckle up. More extreme events are expected,” said Rick Spinrad, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

It starts with “where we are on the globe,” North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello said. “It’s truly a little bit ... unlucky.”

China may have more people, and a large land area like the United States, but “they don’t have the same kind of clash of air masses as much as you do in the U. S. that is producing a lot of the severe weather,” said Susan Cutter, director of the Hazards Vulnerability and Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina.

The U. S. is by far the king of tornadoes and other severe storms.

“It really starts with kind of two things. Number one is the Gulf of Mexico. And number two is elevated terrain to the west,” said Victor Gensini, a Northern Illinois University meteorology professor.

Look at Friday’s deadly weather, and watch out for the next week to see it in action: Dry air from the West goes up over the Rockies and crashes into warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, and it’s all brought together along a stormy jet stream.

In the West, it’s a drumbeat of atmospheric rivers. In the Atlantic, it’s nor’easters in the winter, hurricanes in the summer and sometimes a weird combination of both, like Superstorm Sandy.

“It is a reality that regardless of where you are in the country, where you call home, you’ve likely experienced a high-impact weather event firsthand,” Spinrad said.

Killer tornadoes in December 2021 that struck Kentucky illustrated the uniqueness of the United States.

They hit areas with large immigrant populations. People who fled Central and South America, Bosnia and Africa were all victims. A huge problem was that tornadoes really didn’t happen in those people’s former homes, so they didn’t know what to watch for or what to do, or even know they had to be concerned about tornadoes, said Joseph Trujillo Falcon, a NOAA social scientist who investigated the aftermath.

With colder air up in the Arctic and warmer air in the tropics, the area between them — the mid-latitudes, where the United States is — gets the most interesting weather because of how the air acts in clashing temperatures, and that north-south temperature gradient drives the jet stream, said Northern Illinois meteorology professor Walker Ashley.

Then add mountain ranges that go north-south, jutting into the winds flowing from west to east, and underneath it all the toasty Gulf of Mexico.

The Gulf injects hot, moist air underneath the often cooler, dry air lifted by the mountains, “and that doesn’t happen really anywhere else in the world,” Gensini said.

If the United States as a whole has it bad, the South has it the worst, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a former president of the American Meteorological Society.

“We drew the short straw (in the South) that we literally can experience every single type of extreme weather event,” Shepherd said. “Including blizzards. Including wildfires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes. Every single type. ... There’s no other place in the United States that can say that.”

Florida, North Carolina and Louisiana also stick out in the water so are more prone to being hit by hurricanes, said Shepherd and Dello.

The South has more manufactured housing that is vulnerable to all sorts of weather hazards, and storms are more likely to happen there at night, Ashley said. Night storms are deadly because people can’t see them and are less likely to take cover, and they miss warnings in their sleep.

The extreme weather triggered by America’s unique geography creates hazards. But it takes humans to turn those hazards into disasters, Ashley and Gensini said.

Just look where cities pop up in America and the rest of the world: near water that floods, except maybe Denver, said South Carolina’s Cutter. More people are moving to areas, such as the South, where there are more hazards.

“One of the ways in which you can make your communities more resilient is to not develop them in the most hazard-prone way or in the most hazard-prone portion of the community,” Cutter said. “The insistence on building up barrier islands and development on barrier islands, particularly on the East Coast and the Gulf Coast, knowing that that sand is going to move and having hurricanes hit with some frequency ... seems like a colossal waste of money.”

Construction standards tend to be at the bare minimum and less likely to survive the storms, Ashley said.

“Our infrastructure is crumbling and nowhere near being climate-resilient at all,” Shepherd said.

Poverty makes it hard to prepare for and bounce back from disasters, especially in the South, Shepherd said. That vulnerability is an even bigger issue in other places in the world.

“Safety can be bought,” Ashley said. “Those that are well-to-do and who have resources can buy safety and will be the most resilient when disaster strikes. ... Unfortunately that isn’t all of us.”

“It’s sad that we have to live these crushing losses,” said Kim Cobb, a Brown University professor of environment and society. “We’re worsening our hand by not understanding the landscape of vulnerability given the geographic hand we’ve been dealt.”

436,4 firefighters die in garment factory blaze in Pakistan,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Four firefighters died and nearly a dozen others were injured after a massive fire broke out in a garment factory in the southern Pakistan port city of Karachi, rescue officials and police said Thursday.

The cause of the blaze, which ripped through the factory Wednesday night and eventually caused it to collapse, was not immediately known, police said. Earlier, heavy gray smoke suddenly rose from the factory. Firefighters had almost extinguished the blaze when the collapse occurred.

Rescuers have retrieved the bodies of the firefighters from the rubble of the factory.

Several firefighting vehicles were dispatched to the scene in an industrial area of the city, where many factories are located, officials said. Officers were also assessing the impact of the fire at an adjacent building.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the deaths of firefighters, describing them as “martyrs” who died while trying to save the lives of others. In a statement, he conveyed his condolences to the families of the victims.

Sharif ordered authorities to prepare a strategy to avoid such incidents in future.

Karachi is the capital of southern Sindh province, where such incidents are common. In August 2021, at least 10 people were killed in a massive fire at a chemical factory in Karachi. In the deadliest such incident, 260 people were killed in 2012 after being trapped inside a garment factory when a fire broke out.",0
437,"Small areas reopen near Fukushima nuclear plant, few return","TOKYO (AP) — Evacuation orders were lifted in small sections of a Japanese town just southwest of the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant on Saturday, in time for the area’s popular cherry blossom season, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida joined a ceremony to mark the reopening.

The area of about 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) where entry restrictions were lifted is part of Tomioka town, most of which had already been reopened since an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered triple meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

Former residents and visitors celebrated the latest reopening as they strolled along a street known as “the cherry blossoms tunnel.”

Koichi Ono, 75, was back to the neighborhood where he grew up and lived all his life until he was forced to evacuate. “After 12 years, I can finally return to my life here,” he told NHK television. “The disaster hit when I was just starting my retirement life, so I’m starting all over again.”

Ono, who learned indigo and vegetable dying while evacuating, wants to open a workshop to serve as a meeting place for people. “I hope more people come and visit.”

At the ceremony, Kishida pledged to keep working to reopen all no-go zones.

“The lifting of the evacuation is by no means a final goal, but the start of the recovery,” Kishida said.

The 2011 disaster caused massive amounts of radiation to leak from the plant, and more than 160,000 residents had to evacuate from across Fukushima, including about 30,000 who are still unable to return home.

Tomioka is one of 12 nearby towns fully or partially designated as no-go zones. The two sections in Tomioka that reopened for the first time in 12 years represent one-fifth of the worst-hit no-go zone and were selected by the government along with several other locations in the region for intensive decontamination.

But jobs, daily necessities and infrastructure remain insufficient, making it difficult for younger people to return, and families with small children worry about possible radiation effects.

“The living environment and many other things still need to be sorted out,” Tomioka Mayor Ikuo Yamamoto told reporters.

In the newly reopened Yonomori and Osuge districts of Tomioka, just over 50 of about 2,500 registered residents have reportedly returned or expressed intention to go back to live. Only about 10% of the town’s pre-disaster population of 16,000 have returned since large areas of Tomioka reopened in 2017.

Town surveys show a majority of former residents say they have decided not to return because they have already found jobs and educations and built relationships elsewhere.

The evacuation order was lifted in several sections of another hard-hit town, Namie, northwest of the plant, on Friday. The reopened area accounts for only about 20% of the town.

“I have mixed feelings because there are many residents who still cannot return or have no idea when they can return,” said Namie Mayor Eiko Yoshida at an evacuation-lifting ceremony on Friday.",0
438,No driver? No problem. Robotaxis eye San Francisco expansion,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Two trailblazing ride-hailing services are heading toward uncharted territory as they seek regulatory approval to transport passengers around the clock throughout one of the most densely populated U. S. cities in vehicles that will have no one sitting in the driver’s seat.

If Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, and Waymo, a spinoff from Google, reach their goal before year’s end, San Francisco would become the first U. S. city with two totally driverless services competing against Uber, Lyft and traditional taxis — all of which depend on people to control the automobiles.

But Cruise and Waymo still must navigate around potential roadblocks, including complaints about their vehicles making unexpected, traffic-clogging stops that threaten to inconvenience other travelers and imperil public safety.

Cruise already has been charging people for driverless rides in less congested parts of San Francisco during night-time hours since last June. Waymo has been giving free driverless rides in a broader swath of the city while awaiting clearance to begin charging passengers in robotic vehicles that Google secretly began working on 14 years ago.

The effort to unleash dueling driverless services throughout San Francisco is shaping up to be just the first step in a far more ambitious expansion centered in California — a state where more than 35 million vehicles driven by humans are currently registered.

Cruise recently applied for permission to begin testing its robotic vehicles throughout California at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour) — 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour) above the maximum speed for its robotaxis in San Francisco. Waymo is already testing its driverless cars in Los Angeles — the second largest city in the U. S.

The California push comes on top of Cruise starting to test its robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as well as Phoenix, where since 2020 Waymo’s driverless ride-hailing service has been carrying passengers on Arizona roads that are far less congested and challenging than the streets of San Francisco.

″We still have work to do, but it’s improving at a pretty rapid rate,” Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt told The Associated Press. “As it gets fine-tuned, it will get really elegant over time, but also the safety continues to improve.”

Saswat Panigrahi, Waymo’s chief product officer, expects the company’s past experience to pay off as it transplants what it has learned from operating a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix to more heavily trafficked cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.

“The uncertainty is definitely now far lower, having operated a fully autonomous service with real riders,” Panigrahi said.

Both Cruise and Waymo recently announced their driverless fleets each have covered more than 1 million miles without a major accident. But their robotaxis also have experienced nagging problems in San Francisco that have caused traffic headaches and other nuisances that threaten to inconvenience people or, worse, block emergency vehicles rushing to a fire or other urgent calls for help.

“The expected things are easy, but it’s the unexpected things that humans react to in real time that are a concern,” said transportation expert Nico Larco, who is director of the Urbanism Next Center at the University of Oregon. “Best case, it will just causes confusion, havoc, congestion if the cars stop in the middle of the road. But the worst cases could actually be harmful to someone.”

A pair of Associated Press reporters witnessed the potential problems first hand in mid-February after a Waymo vehicle safely transported them on a trip through San Francisco that required navigating hilly terrain, turning in rush-hour traffic and yielding to pedestrians darting out into the crosswalks.

During one ride, the robotaxi stopped in the middle of the street after the AP reporters got out, and remained there for several minutes while a line of human-operated cars stacked up behind it. It turned out that a back door on the driver’s side hadn’t completely closed.

In another glitch involving Cruise last September, an AP reporter took a roughly five-mile ride in a robotaxi nicknamed “Peaches,” which repeatedly bypassed the designated destination. The reporter finally had to use the Cruise app to contact a dispatcher in a remote center so the car could be stopped — in the middle of the street.

Vogt noted that a number of improvements have been made since then, and indeed two different Cruise robotaxis — one named “Cherry” and the other named “Hollandaise” — dropped off the same reporter and his colleague at their designated designations on a follow-up trip, although Cherry stopped at a bus stop that briefly prevented the arrival of an oncoming bus.

Broader concerns about robotaxis operating in ways that cause headaches for the people outside the vehicle were raised in a cautionary letter sent to California regulators in January by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority.

The letter cited at least 92 reported incidents of Cruise robotaxis making sudden stops in the street through Dec. 31. At least three of the incidents blocked the right of ways for public transportation for periods ranging from nine to 18 minutes.

Within the past year, driverless Cruise vehicles have also obstructed firefighters rushing to a three-alarm fire and or illegally entered into areas where there were ongoing efforts to douse a fire, according to the authority, which is asking regulators to hold off on unleashing robotaxis throughout San Francisco at all hours until there is more information about why and how often the cars periodically clog traffic. The abrupt braking and stops by Cruise’s robotaxis have also been under investigation by federal regulators since late last year.

“We are just very wary,” said Tilly Chang, the executive director for the San Francisco transportation authority. “We want to be supporters and help facilitate (driverless rides), but we have to make sure it’s safe.”

Meanwhile, dozens of other technology companies and automakers have joined in a race to develop self-driving car technology at a collective cost of more than $100 billion. Their ultimate goal is to make money off robotic drivers that are safer and less expensive than human drivers. Robotaxis could also lower prices for passengers, although Vogt believes consumers may be willing to pay more for rides without a stranger behind the wheel.

The investments so far have produced a mixed bag of successes, flops and hyperbole from the likes of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who predicted nearly four years ago that the electric automaker would be running a huge robotaxi service by the end of 2020 but still hasn’t come close to realizing that ambition.

Cruise’s owner, the nearly 125-year-old General Motors, is nonetheless so confident robotaxis will drive more responsibly than humans and be able to expand its driverless service into more U. S. markets that it made the bold prediction last fall that Cruise would generate $1 billion in revenue by 2025 — a big jump from Cruise’s revenue of $106 million last year when it also lost nearly $2 billion.

That optimism is in sharp contrast to the disheartening experience of another storied automaker, Ford Motor, which paid $1 billion in 2017 to acquire driverless startup Argo AI, only to shut down the division last October and swallow a $2.7 billion loss after failing to find a buyer for the technology.",0
439,"Fed up by LA pothole, Arnold Schwarzenegger fills it himself","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fed up by an enormous pothole in his Los Angeles neighborhood, Arnold Schwarzenegger picked up a shovel and filled it himself.

The actor and former California governor tweeted a video Tuesday of him and a helper using packaged concrete to repair the road in the Brentwood area.

“Today, after the whole neighborhood has been upset about this giant pothole that’s been screwing up cars and bicycles for weeks, I went out with my team and fixed it,” he wrote on Twitter. “I always say, let’s not complain, let’s do something about it. Here you go.”

A neighbor rolled down her car window and shouted her thanks at the action movie star.

“You’re welcome,” said Schwarzenegger, decked out in work boots, a leather jacket and shades reminiscent of his role in “Terminator.”

“You have to do it yourself. This is crazy. For three weeks I’ve been waiting for this hole to be closed,” he said.

Daniel Ketchell, a spokesperson for Schwarzenegger, said Brentwood residents made repeated requests for repairs since winter storms opened up potholes and cracks on local roads.

Mayor Karen Bass last week announced a plan to address what she called an unprecedented number of damaged streets across the city. Since Dec. 30, Los Angeles has received 19,692 service requests for repairs, and as of April 6, crews had filled at least 17,549 potholes, officials said.

The Department of Public Works did not immediately respond to an email asking whether the pothole Schwarzenegger filled had been scheduled to be repaired.",0
440,NPR protests as Twitter calls it 'state-affiliated media',"NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter has labeled National Public Radio as “state-affiliated media” on the social media site, a move some worried Wednesday could undermine public confidence in the news organization.

NPR said it was disturbed to see the description added to all of the tweets that it sends out, with John Lansing, its president and CEO, calling it “unacceptable for Twitter to label us this way.”

It was unclear why Twitter made the move. Twitter’s owner, Elon Musk, quoted a definition of state-affiliated media in the company’s guidelines as “outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.”

NPR does receive U. S. government funding through grants from federal agencies and departments, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The company said it accounts for less than 1% of NPR’s annual operating budget. But until Wednesday, the same Twitter guidelines said that “state-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK or NPR in the United States, are not defined as state-affiliated media for the purposes of this policy.”

NPR has now been removed from that sentence on Twitter’s website.

Asked for comment, Twitter’s press office responded with an automated poop emoji.

The move came just days after Twitter stripped The New York Times of its verification check mark.

“NPR and our member stations are supported by millions of listeners who depend on us for the independent, fact-based journalism we provide,” Lansing said. “NPR stands for freedom of speech and holding the powerful accountable.”

The literary organization PEN America, in calling for Twitter to reverse the move, underlined that NPR “assiduously maintains editorial independence.”

Liz Woolery, PEN America’s digital policy leader, said Twitter’s decision was “a dangerous move that could further undermine public confidence in reliable news sources.”",0
441,Alabama attorney general takes over prison litigation,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall is taking control of prison litigation away from the Department of Corrections and moving it to his office in their latest public disagreement.

Marshall informed the department that the attorney general intends to remove the assistant attorney general status of the department’s six attorneys, the Alabama Department of Corrections said Thursday in an emailed statement.

“We will not speculate about the impact the AG’s decision will have on the ADOC, but I am confident in the ability of our Legal Division to protect the interests of this department throughout this transition. We will continue to focus on the critical mission of the ADOC — to provide public safety through the secure confinement, rehabilitation, and reentry of offenders,” Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said in a statement Thursday.

A spokesperson for Marshall did not immediately return an email seeking comment about the reasons for the change. The governor’s office directed questions to the prison system.

The prison system is in the midst of high-stakes litigation that is pricey and carries potential long-term ramifications for the direction of the state’s prison system. The Department of Justice has sued the state, alleging that male prisoners are housed in violent prisons that violate the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. A federal judge has also ordered the state to increase prison staff in an ongoing lawsuit over prison health care.

Marshall has had prior disagreements with the prison system. Earlier this year, he sued the ADOC and the Board of Pardons and Paroles to try to block the release of inmates to supervised release, arguing that victims’ families had not been properly notified.",0
442,Has T. rex lost its bite? Menacing snarl may be wrong,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Tyrannosaurus rex is often shown baring massive, sharp teeth, like the ferocious creature in “Jurassic Park.” But new research suggests that this classic image might be wrong.

The teeth on T. rex and other big theropods were likely covered by scaly lips, concludes a study published Thursday in the journal Science. The dinosaur’s teeth didn’t stick out when its mouth was closed, and even in a wide open bite, you might just see the tips, the scientists found.

The research is the latest in a long back-and-forth over how dinosaur mouths really looked.

Recent depictions show big teeth jutting out of the dinosaurs’ jaws, even when closed. Some thought the predators’ teeth were just too big to fit in their mouths, said study author Thomas Cullen, a paleontologist at Auburn University in Alabama.

When researchers compared skulls from dinosaurs and living reptiles, though, they found this wasn’t the case. Some large monitor lizards actually have bigger teeth than T. rex compared to their skull size, and can still fit them under a set of scaly lips, Cullen said.

The scientists also found clues in the pattern of wear and tear on tooth surfaces.

For a creature like a crocodile, whose teeth stick out of its mouth, the exposed part gets worn down quickly — “like someone’s taken a sander to the side of the tooth,” said another study author Mark Witton, a paleoartist at England’s University of Portsmouth.

But when researchers analyzed a tooth from a Daspletosaurus, a T. rex relative, they found it was in good condition and it didn’t show that uneven damage pattern.

With this evidence and other clues from the dinosaurs’ anatomy, the study makes a good case for lipped tyrannosaurs, said University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, who was not involved with the study. Still, “we’re not talking kissy lips,” he pointed out — they’d be thin and scaly like those of the Komodo dragon, a large lizard.

It’s not the first time our depictions of dinosaurs have been called into question: Other research has shown that T. rex was more hunched over than we used to think, and that fierce velociraptors probably sported feathers. Most of what we know about dinosaurs comes from their bones, but it can be harder to get clear answers about soft tissues like skin, which usually aren’t preserved as fossils.

Adding lips may make dinosaurs look a little less ferocious, but it also makes them feel more realistic, Witton said.

“You don’t really see a monster,” he said. “You see an animal.”

443,Estonia's Parliament approves PM Kaja Kallas' 3rd Cabinet,"HELSINKI (AP) — Estonia’s Parliament on Wednesday gave the green light to a new coalition to form a government, led by the center-right Reform Party of Kaja Kallas.

Her pro-business party overwhelmingly won the parliamentary election in the Baltic country on March 5 with 31.2% of the vote — receiving nearly twice as many votes as its closest rival, the far-right populist EKRE party, which will not be part of the government.

Lawmakers in the 101-seat Riigikogu legislature voted 59-38 to accept the proposed three-party Cabinet, made up of the Reform Party, the centrist Estonia 200 party and the Social Democratic Party.

After weeks of intense talks, the three parties clinched a deal over the weekend to form a liberal-oriented coalition government to be led by prime minister-designate Kallas.

It will be Kallas’ third term as prime minister of Estonia, which is a member of both the European Union and NATO. She has led the country since January 2021, when she became the first female head of government in the nation of 1.3 million.

Addressing lawmakers on Tuesday, Kallas stressed that the coalition agreement includes the parties’ vision of the most important challenges facing the country.

The new government’s aim is “to ensure the all-round security of the Estonian state, to invest in the competitiveness and energy security of the Estonian economy, to implement green reforms together with the modernization of tax policy,” she said.

Despite scoring an impressive election win, Kallas — a 45-year-old lawyer and a former lawmaker at the European Parliament — needed junior partners to form a Cabinet that can govern with a comfortable majority for the next four years.

Together, the three parties hold 60 seats in Parliament.

In its program for government, the coalition pledged — among other things — to improve Estonia’s worsening government finances by raising taxes; to increase defense expenditure to 3% of GDP; to reform climate and energy policies; and to advocate policies to allow same-sex marriage in the former Soviet republic.

In addition to Kallas as prime minister, Reform is set to have six portfolios, including defense and finance, in the 13-member Cabinet.

Estonia 200, which is entering Parliament for the first time, and the Social Democrats will get three ministerial portfolios each. Estonia 200 will get the foreign ministry, to be led by Margus Tsahkna.

Defense and security will top the new Cabinet’s agenda, Kallas said over the weekend. Estonia has been a major supplier of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine since the Russian invasion started last year. Kallas has emerged as one of Europe’s most outspoken supporters of Kyiv.

The government is due to be sworn in next week, once President Alar Karis has signed off on the appointments.

This story has been corrected to show that the Reform party is set to have portfolios including defense and finance, not defense and technology. The spelling of the designated foreign minister’s name has also been corrected.",0
444,Storms upend one of North America's largest tire plants,"TUPELO, Miss. (AP) — Production at a large north Mississippi tire plant has ground to a halt in the wake of a damaging tornado, pausing operations at one of Goodyear’s largest production facilities in North America.

Storms that dropped possibly dozens of tornadoes tore through the South and Midwest on April 1, killing at least 26 and causing widespread damage. Cooper Tire and Rubber Company, which was acquired by the manufacturing giant Goodyear in 2021, has shuttered its Tupelo plant as officials oversee repairs to the facility.

Large sections of roofing atop the plant sustained heavy damage during the early morning storm that blew through Tupelo, which is about 115 miles (185 kilometers) southeast of Memphis.

Goodyear officials have not revealed a timetable for when the plant’s roughly 1,700 workers can return to work. Melissa Monaco, the vice present of communications for the Ohio-based company, told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal that waylaid workers would be paid for the duration of the shutdown.

The Tupelo plant is the second-largest production facility for Goodyear’s North American network, according to Modern Tire Dealer. The trade magazine estimates the plant produces about 42,000 tires per day.",0
445,Father of girl who drew anti-war art extradited to Russia,"The father of a a Russian girl sent to an orphanage after drawing an antiwar sketch at school has been extradited from Belarus back to Russia, a human rights group reported Wednesday. He faces two years in prison there.

Alexei Moskalyov fled house arrest just before his sentencing hearing last month in the town of Yefremov, south of Moscow. He was detained in Belarus two days later. According to the Belarusian human rights center Viasna, when visitors tried to find Moskalyov in a Belarussian prison on Wednesday, they were told he had been extradited to Russia.

Moskalyov, 54 was charged over social media posts criticizing the war in Ukraine under a law adopted days after Russian troops invaded in February 2022. He rejected the accusations.

In a case that drew international outrage, the father of 13-year-old Maria Moskalyova was convicted of discrediting the Russian military and handed a two-year prison term, while his daughter was dispatched to an orphanage.

According to his lawyer and supporters, Moskalyov’s troubles began after his daughter drew a picture at Yefremov School No. 9 that depicted missiles flying over a Russian flag at a woman and child. The drawing also featured the words “No to war” and “Glory to Ukraine.” Moskalyov was fined and convicted over his social media posts.

The Kremlin has been cracking down on dissent, targeting anyone who criticizes the war.",0
446,Trump arrest prompts Jesus comparisons,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For the most devoted Trump conspiracy theorists, there are no coincidences and timing is everything.

So when ex-President Donald Trump was arraigned Tuesday on charges that he falsified business records to obscure hush money payments in an effort to influence the 2016 election, some of his most ardent followers quickly noted the court appearance came during Christianity’s most sacred week, Holy Week, when many Christians commemorate Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection.

“Seems there was someone else who was tortured and crucified this week,” read one post on Gab, a platform popular with Trump supporters. A similar post on Telegram put Trump’s case in apocalyptic terms: “Good vs Evil. Biblical times. Divine timing.”

Comparisons likening Trump to Christ were among the top online narratives about the Republican former president and his criminal charges circulating in the last several days, according to an analysis of online and social media content conducted by Zignal Labs, a media intelligence firm, on behalf of The Associated Press.

Zignal’s analysis found tens of thousands of mentions calling Trump a martyr. The number more than doubled immediately after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., linked the prosecution of Trump to the persecution of Christ during an interview.

Trump pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to 34 felony counts alleging he hid payments made during his 2016 presidential campaign to two women — an adult-film actor and a former Playboy model — who claimed they had sexual encounters with him, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child Trump fathered out of wedlock.

Greene, who traveled to New York City to protest Trump’s arraignment, noted the timing of the arraignment during a broadcast interview before bringing up the Christ comparison.

“Jesus was arrested and murdered by the Roman government,” she said. “There have been many people throughout history that have been arrested and persecuted by radical corrupt governments, and it’s beginning today in New York City.”

The comparison was denounced by Episcopal Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, who oversees more than 500 churches in Greene’s home state and called her comments blasphemous and disgusting.

“While Marjorie Taylor Greene may put her political loyalty ahead of God, Christians do not,” Jackson said. “Those of faith believe Christ always has, and always will, stand alone.”

Trump’s personal, political and professional history make him an odd choice to stand in for Christ, Christianity’s savior and central figure. Yet it’s an outgrowth from Christian nationalism, a movement that fuses traditional Christian themes and imagery with conservative candidates like Trump, according to John Fea, a historian at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, who has researched evangelical Christianity’s role in American history.

“They see this as spiritual warfare, and Trump is on the side of the angels,” Fea said. “In this view, Trump is politically a savior, he is going to restore America, and he will rise from the ashes in November despite the persecution and the suffering.”

Trump has encouraged such beliefs by claiming he is uniquely qualified to lead the country, by calling his 2024 campaign to retake the White House a “Final Battle” against his enemies and by praising QAnon, a movement that views him as a crusader against what it says is a secret, child-sacrificing cabal that controls world events.

He embraced the role of martyr again on Tuesday, when his campaign created a fake mug shot and included it in a fundraising email, even though no mug shot of the former president was taken that day.

In the Christian nationalist view, Trump’s return to New York could be seen as an echo of Christ’s triumphant entry to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, Fea said, with the exception that Christ rode a donkey and Trump arrived in a motorcade.

Behind the religious metaphors, the online reaction of Trump supporters to Tuesday’s arraignment was mixed, fragmented by competing conspiracy theories and Trump’s own complicated role in the movement he helped build.

While many far-right commenters decried the charges, others said Trump deserved no sympathy after he didn’t pardon defendants charged in the failed Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U. S. Capitol. Some pointed to the charges as one reason why they now support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ expected bid for the Republican presidential nomination.

Some Trump supporters promoted peaceful protests as a way to send a signal to the nation, yet others cited debunked claims about Jan. 6, arguing that any protests could be traps staged by federal agents.

“Watch out for infiltrators, the minute they want to start trouble call it off and everyone go home,” a poster wrote on Gab in response to a post announcing Greene’s protest in Manhattan.

Still other commenters dismissed the very real legal jeopardy facing Trump, saying he is orchestrating the entire prosecution as a way to ferret out his enemies.

The last was a sentiment especially popular on QAnon message boards, where Christian imagery regularly mixes with fantasies about one-world governments, child sacrifices and blood rituals.

447,"No known threats to Boston Marathon, but police are prepared","BOSTON (AP) — There are no known threats to this year’s Boston Marathon, but on the 10-year anniversary of the terrorist attack that killed three spectators, federal, state and city law enforcement leaders said Thursday that they are prepared for anything.

“At this point in time, the FBI is not aware of any specific or credible threats targeting this year’s race,” Joseph Bonavolonta, head of the FBI’s Boston office, said at a news conference. “And while we’re confident in this assessment at this particular time, we are asking you to remain vigilant because we all know how quickly the threat landscape can change.”

Law enforcement agencies are more coordinated and prepared than ever to respond to any emergency, officials said, but the public remains the first line of defense. Spectators have been urged to report anything suspicious.

In addition to the multitude of uniformed police officers along the marathon’s route, plainclothes officers will also be dispersed throughout the crowds, officials said.

Bomb squads, hazardous material teams and SWAT units will also be standing at the ready to respond to any emergency situation, police said.

“As you can see, we have a multilayered approach and a well-coordinated plan by both the city, state and federal partners,” Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox said.

Spectators were urged to take public transportation not just to the marathon, but to the annual Patriots’ Day Boston Red Sox game and a possible Boston Bruins playoff game, Cox said.

Marathon fans should also be prepared to pass through security checkpoints in some areas where they will be subjected to bag checks, authorities said.

In addition to the three people killed in the 2013 attack, 17 people lost limbs and nearly 300 others were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs exploded at the finish line, putting a violent end to that year’s race.

Those victims and their families will be on everyone’s minds this year, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said.

“This year’s 10-year anniversary, the marking of a decade since the horrific attacks, brings with it another set of emotions and reflections,” she said.",0
448,EU reaches provisional deal to raise renewable energy target,"BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union countries and negotiators from the EU’s parliament reached a provisional deal Thursday to raise the share of renewables in the bloc’s energy mix, another step to accelerate its green transition.

The European Council, which represents the 27 member nations, said the agreement reached after all-night negotiations would raise the renewable energy target to 42.5% of total consumption by 2030. The current goal is 32%.

To meet the EU’s goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the EU’s executive commission supported a target of 45%. The council and the European Parliament left a door open for such an increase, agreeing on “an additional 2.5% indicative top up that would allow to reach 45%.”

Russia’s war in Ukraine has accelerated the EU’s green transition. The bloc reduced its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and increased its renewable energy use over the past year.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement announced Thursday would allow “for more ambition and faster roll-out of renewables,”

“This will help us progress towards climate neutrality, strengthen our energy security and boost our competitiveness, all at once,” von der Leyen said.

According to EU data, the bloc’s gas consumption dropped 19.3% during August 2022-January 2023 compared to the average for the same months between 2017 and 2022.

A review by global energy think tank Ember showed that wind and solar generated a record 22% of the EU’s electricity last year and for the first time overtook gas, which accounted for 20%. Coal power accounted for 16%.

The negotiations between the European Parliament and the European Council dragged on into the night because of a rift between two groups of countries over the role of nuclear energy in the production of hydrogen.

In the end, the agreement gave nations the possibility of using nuclear technology.

Under the deal, 42% of the hydrogen used in industry should come from renewable fuels of non-biological origin by 2030 and 60% by 2035. EU countries producing hydrogen from nuclear power would be able to reduce their overall renewable hydrogen production target by 20% if they also reduce the share of hydrogen from fossil fuels.

The deal still needs formal approval to take effect.

449,A great read turned into a dream role for Jennifer Garner,"If you devoured Laura Dave’s novel “ The Last Thing He Told Me,” you’re not alone. The book spent 65 weeks as a New York Times Best Seller and one of those readers who couldn’t put it down was Jennifer Garner.

“I read it with my middle child. We kept pushing bedtime later and later because we were just compelled to read one more chapter, two more chapters, three more chapters,” Garner said in a recent interview, where she had a copy of the book next to her on a chair. “I can’t even explain how much I loved it.”

Her great read turned into a “ dream role ” when Julia Roberts — who was originally attached to star in a TV show based on the book had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. Dave co-created the series, which debuts Friday on Apple TV+, with Josh Singer, her Oscar-winning husband, and wrote the adaptation. Reese Witherspoon, who chose the book for her Reese’s Book Club after its May 2021 release, is also an executive producer.

Garner plays Hannah Hall, who marries a man named Owen (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) after a whirlwind courtship. Hannah is not just a new wife but a stepmom to Owen’s teen daughter, Bailey, played by Angourie Rice, who regards her as a rude interruption to her family of two. One day Owen disappears and leaves Hannah a note instructing her to protect Bailey, with no other information. Hannah and Bailey are left to figure out what happened.

The idea of playing a person “growing into becoming a mother” intrigued Garner. As a mom of three, she gravitates to children and describes herself as a “natural caretaker.” Garner co-foundedrhe children’s fresh produce-centric company Once Upon a Farm and is a board member of Save the Children. She’s also acted in a number of family friendly films including “Yes Day” and “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.” Garner was curious about a character who learns “how much parenting comes from doing it.”

For Rice, she adjusted to play someone who “doesn’t know how to have a mother.

“Bailey has only had one person in her life, and that’s her dad. That is the first and only person she goes to for anything,” Rice said. “They really form a team, so when that goes away, I think Bailey is resistant to Hannah because she is everything that her dad is not. She doesn’t understand Bailey and Bailey is so used to being understood.”

Garner and Rice found their off-screen relationship also progressed throughout filming in a more organic way, than becoming an insta-mother and daughter.

“Sometimes you play a mom in a movie and you are thrust in the role of motherhood. You’re being a mom and then the actual relationship under it has to catch up,” Garner said. “In this case, you’re watching us grow closer and closer and more and more trusting of each other into a really cool partnership in the way that Hannah and Bailey experienced as well.”

Garner also had to still her own energy to match Hannah’s, who is more reserved.

“Hannah and I are incredibly different,” she said. “I have kind of Labrador Retriever energy and Hannah is more a sphinx of a cat who wants to be left alone.”

The actors also had the benefit of staying true to the book with Dave as writer, with the guidance of Singer.

“How Josh likes to work is we have a backyard with this old 100 year old pine tree, which you can sit under. Before we even started shooting, Jen would come over and we would go through the script again and again. Josh wanted to hear how the words sounded. Then Angourie joined us and some of the other cast joined us,” Dave said. “The script was so lived in by the time that we got to set.”

Dave spent 10 years writing the book and says for someone who loves the process of writing, this one was “painful.” Working on the screenplay swung the other way and was so positive, it made her emotional. “There were a couple of times when we were in my backyard where I had to casually say, ‘Excuse me’ and I went inside and I was like a puddle. And then I’d go back outside and Jen would be like, ‘You’re not fooling anyone. I see the tears.’”

Of the couple working together again, Dave says, “I should be so lucky.”

“Josh taught me so, so much,” she said. “There is not a note that this guy gets that he does not think about or want to talk about or and it created an atmosphere where everyone felt included, which I loved watching. I like to be by myself in a room and talk to nobody. There’s no plans that can be canceled, that I’m not happy they were canceled. He’s the opposite.”

Singer is equally as complimentary. “I’ve been a Laura Dave fan for a long time now,” he said. “She has such a stirring, unerring compass for emotion, for character and for story. There’s nothing better than working with someone who has a true compass.”",0
450,Video shows Louisville police under fire from bank shooter,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Police body camera video released Tuesday showed the chaotic moments when police arrived at the scene of a mass shooting at a bank in downtown Louisville, as the shooter they couldn’t see from the street rained bullets down on them.

The videos, taken from two wounded officers’ lapels, offer a rare perspective of police officers responding to a massacre that killed five and injured eight others Monday. One, a rookie officer, was shot in the head within minutes of arriving at the scene, as his partner was grazed by a bullet and sought cover while still trying to take down the shooter.

Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked reporters through edited footage and still photos at a new conference Tuesday and praised the responding officers for their heroism.

They received the call of a shooting at Old National Bank at 8:38 a.m., and the two officers arrived three minutes later, according to a chronology provided by police. They hadn’t even gotten out of the patrol car when the gunman began firing on them.

“Back up, back up, back up,” one officer shouted as gunshots thundered in the background.

One still image from surveillance video showed the 25-year-old shooter, who worked at the bank, holding a rifle, wearing jeans, a blue button-down shirt and sneakers, surrounded by broken glass inside the building. He had already shot numerous people inside, and police said he set up an ambush position to attack officers as they arrived.

The front doors were glass, elevated from the sidewalk, and because of the reflection, the officers could not see the shooter inside, Humphrey said. But he could see them.

Officer Cory Galloway retrieved a rifle from the trunk of the patrol car.

“Cover for me,” he said, and they reported to dispatch that there had been shots fired.

Galloway was training rookie Officer Nickolas Wilt, who had graduated from the police academy just 10 days earlier. The videos showed them walking up the stairs toward the front door when the gunman fired a barrage of bullets.

Wilt was shot in the head, though that was not captured on video. Galloway was grazed in the shoulder, police said. His body camera showed that he fell and then took cover behind a concrete planter at the bottom of the staircase leading to the building. Sirens from the dozens of police cars coming toward them wailed in the background.

“The shooter has an angle on that officer,” he said in the video recording. “We need to get up there. I don’t know where he’s at, the glass is blocking him.”

A video taken by a bystander across the street, which police also released Tuesday, showed him darting back and forth from one side of the planter to another, trying to get a shot at the gunman.

He waited, and as other officers arrived, more gunshots rang out and glass shattered.

Galloway fired toward the gunman at 8:44 a.m., three minutes after arriving.

“I think I got him down! I think he’s down!” he shouted. “Suspect down! Get the officer!”

He advanced into the building, and shards of glass crunched under his feet. The video then showed Galloway approaching the suspect, who lay on the ground inside the lobby next to a long rifle.

“I think you can see the tension in that video,” Humphrey said Tuesday. “You can understand the stress that those officers are going through. ... They did absolutely exactly what they needed to do to save lives. Once officers arrived on scene, not another person was shot.”

Wilt was transported in the back of a police car to a hospital, Humphrey said. In the chaotic first minutes, police treated and triaged the victims inside. Humphrey said the ambulance service was short-staffed, so a police lieutenant drove the ambulance while emergency crews treated people at the scene.

Wilt was still in critical but stable condition Tuesday, according to University of Louisville Hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jason Smith.

Two of the four wounded still in the hospital had injuries that were not life-threatening, Smith said.

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said it was crucial to release the footage because “transparency is important — even more so in a time of crisis.”

Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said at a news conference that bank employee Connor Sturgeon, 25, bought the AR-15 assault-style rifle used in the attack at a local dealership on April 4.

Armed with the rifle, Sturgeon killed his co-workers — including a close friend of Kentucky’s governor — while livestreaming the attack.

“We do know this was targeted. He knew those individuals, of course, because he worked there,” Gwinn-Villaroel said, but didn’t give an indication of a motive behind the shooting.

Gwinn-Villaroel praised the “heroic actions” of officers who engaged the shooter without hesitation when they arrived.

“They went towards danger in order to save and preserve life,” she said. “They stopped the threat so other lives could be saved. No hesitation, and they did what they were called do to.”

The shooting, the 15th mass killing in the country this year, comes just two weeks after a former student killed three children and three adults at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) to the south.

In Louisville, five Old National Bank employees were killed: Joshua Barrick, 40, a senior vice president; Tommy Elliott, 63, also a senior vice president; Jim Tutt Jr., 64, a commercial real estate market executive; Juliana Farmer, 45, a loan analyst; and Deana Eckert, 57, an executive administrative officer.

The mayor urged unity as the community processes its grief, over this shooting and the many other spasms of gun violence that have stunned this city.

“We’re all feeling shaken by this, and scared and angry and a lot of other things too,” Greenberg said. “It’s important that we come together as a community to process this tragedy in particular but not just this tragedy because the reality is that we have already lost 40 people to gun violence in Louisville this year.”

451,Andalusia considers more irrigation near Spanish wetlands,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — A controversial plan to increase irrigation in an area adjoining one of Europe’s most prized wetlands won initial approval Wednesday from lawmakers in southern Spain’s Andalusia region.

The proposal to rezone the land goes against the advice of ecologists and repeated warnings from Spain’s central government and European Union officials. They say the Doñana nature reserve is drying up under pressure from farming, tourism and a prolonged drought made worse by climate change.

As expected, the regional parliament voted in favor of considering the bill, which was sponsored by the conservative Popular Party that rules Andalusia and had the support of the far-right Vox party.

If the measure becomes law, 1,000 to 1,500 hectares (2,470-3,700 acres) of land near the Doñana reserve would be declared irrigable. The bill’s critics say the zoning change would in effect grant an amnesty to the many farms that already use illegal wells to tap into the aquifer underlying the wetlands to grow strawberries for export across Europe.

The Popular Party says its intention is to help farmers who are in a legal limbo regularize their livelihoods, and the party pledged the plan would not hurt the wetlands.

Andalusia government spokesperson Ramón Fernández-Pacheco said the regional administration was committed to protecting Doñana and that a provision of the proposed bill calls for individually analyzing the claims of farmers who might be eligible to receive surface water.

“I am worried that the EU is receiving a distorted image of what the bill says,” Fernández-Pacheco said.

Ecologists and opposition parties, however, accused the Popular Party of promising surface water that it cannot provide in an attempt to win votes ahead of local elections on May 28. The bill could be pushed through before the elections, although that is not guaranteed.

Spain’s central authorities have pledged millions to save Doñana and plan to reroute water from another river system. That water, however, the Madrid government says is meant to replace well water already legally tapped, not increase irrigation.

Florika Fink-Hooijer, the head of the EU’s Directorate General for the Environment, told Spain’s government last month that the EU would not tolerate Andalusia’s plan. In 2021, the European Court of Justice condemned Spain for neglecting the Doñana wetlands. Further neglect of the nature reserve could result in a hefty fine for Spain.

Scientists who work in Doñana agree that the plan would only increase the strain on the aquifer.

“This vote should not even take place,” Eloy Revilla, director of the Doñana Biological Station of the Spanish National Research Council, told The Associated Press by phone.

Revilla said it would send the wrong message: that those who use illegal wells could get away with it.

“It will not solve the problems of Doñana or the farmers. It will only further complicate a situation that is already complex,” he said.

Other farmers who use legal wells on already irrigable land are also against the move, fearing it will damage the reputation of the berries that they market as being grown near the pristine conditions of Doñana.

The Doñana reserve covers 74,000 hectares (182,000 acres) on an estuary where the Guadalquivir River meets the Atlantic Ocean on Spain’s southern coast. It is a wintering site for half a million waterfowl and a stopover spot for millions more birds that migrate from Africa to northern Europe. It is also home to five threatened bird species, including the endangered Spanish imperial eagle.

It has also become a major agricultural center for farmers who in previous decades shifted over from low-water crops like olives and grains to water-thirsty berries to boost revenues.

The farmers who demand water rights are owners of lands that were deemed non-irrigable when in 2004 an agreement was struck between the authorities, ecologists and farmers to manage farming activity around the reserve.

Since then, the berry boom led to an estimated 1,000-2,000 illegal wells popping up near the reserve, according to studies carried out by environmental group WWF.

An almost identical bill was presented by the Popular Party last year, but did not make it to a final vote due to a snap election in the region.

“For the first time, after such a long fight, we have hope that we can resolve our problems after so many years,” said Romualdo Macías, president of the platform that represents some 1,500 farmers pushing for the new plan. “Doñana cannot be a park with a wall around it and everything on this side left to be a desert.”

The renewed initiative comes with Spain suffering a record drought in some areas after a record-hot 2022 for the country.

Revilla, the biologist, said that the situation is “critical” for the lagoons and marshes that make Doñana a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve.

“The ecosystems in Doñana that depend on subterranean water are in critical condition,” he said. “And it will only get worse if we consider that last year was very dry and this year promises to be drier still.”",0
452,No punishment for official after incident with Robertson,"LONDON (AP) — No action will be taken against assistant referee Constantine Hatzidakis after his interaction with Liverpool defender Andy Robertson, the English Football Association said Thursday.

Video replays appeared to show the official raise his arm toward Robertson, who had approached Hatzidakis after the halftime whistle during Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sunday.

Hatzidakis was then stood down from duty while the FA looked into matter. But the governing body said there was no case to answer.

“We have thoroughly reviewed all of the evidence in relation to the recent incident at Anfield involving the Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson and match official Constantine Hatzidakis, and we will be taking no further action,” the FA said. “Our comprehensive process involved reviewing detailed statements from Liverpool and PGMOL, as well as multiple angles of video footage, in relation to both the incident and its surrounding circumstances.”

Sky Sports cameras zooming in on the confrontation showed Hatzidakis seemingly throwing up his arm and making contact with Robertson, who gesticulated that he had been hit by the official.

453,'LeBron' examines the remarkable career of NBA star,"This cover image released by Avid Reader Press shows ""Lebron"" by Jeff Benedict. (Avid Reader Press via AP)This cover image released by Avid Reader Press shows ""Lebron"" by Jeff Benedict. (Avid Reader Press via AP)

LeBron James has lived a very public life. Who can forget the 2002 Sports Illustrated cover anointing him “The Chosen One” when he was just 17? Now 38, he’s done thousands of interviews, spoken out on a variety of social justice issues, earned more than a billion dollars as an athlete and businessman, and — oh, yeah — won four NBA championships with three different teams.

But until now, no writer has packaged his life story into one narrative. Jeff Benedict, who co-wrote the bestselling “Tiger Woods” with Armen Keteyian, follows the same playbook here. He spent years combing through the public record, watching hours of video footage, and talking to hundreds of people from different stages of James’ life to craft “LeBron.” The book serves as both an origin story for the living NBA legend and an examination of how James changed the role of superstar athlete in so many ways — from business to entertainment to politics.

Readers who don’t already know the beats of James’ life will find them all here. Even those who already know what “The Decision” refers to (James’ 2010 televised special announcing his signing with the Miami Heat after seven years playing for his home state Cleveland Cavaliers) will appreciate the perspective Benedict provides when it comes to just how much James changed the perception of what it means to be a modern athlete.

Benedict didn’t interview James directly for the book, but that fact drives home one of the book’s main themes — James built his empire by surrounding himself with an inner circle of close friends, all of whom he met before adulthood. His fame now allows him to seek advice from and partner with scores of other influential people, but Team LeBron at its core is still his high school teammate Maverick Carter; fellow Akron, Ohio, native son Randy Mims; and Rich Paul, who James met in 2002 when Paul was a young entrepreneur selling vintage sports jerseys in Atlanta (Paul is now James’ agent and the CEO of Klutch Sports, which reps more than three dozen NBA players).

Given the fact that James didn’t speak to Benedict for the book, some critics may decry the armchair psychology in these pages. But James’ life has certainly not been unexamined. He has spoken at length about growing up fatherless, the fierce loyalty he feels toward his mother, and how grateful he is to coaches and neighbors who helped create an environment where he could focus on school and basketball and avoid any serious missteps.

That’s not to say “LeBron” is a hagiography. It touches on things like the Hummer his unemployed mom gave him when he turned 18 thanks to a bank loan secured by the promise of James’ future earnings, or the jerseys Rich Paul didn’t make him pay for, in violation of Ohio’s rules for high school basketball players. But with the benefit of hindsight, they are just bumps in the road to superstardom.

In fact, “LeBron” makes a more compelling argument about just how remarkable it is that a player of James’ magnitude has lived a scandal-free life, and in fact, has focused his platform and celebrity on meaningful issues like Black Lives Matter or inner city education.

The young boy who wrote “NBA Player/NBA Player/NBA Player” when asked to write down three things he wanted to be when he grew up, is arguably now the most influential NBA player of all time. That’s the story Benedict tells in what — for now — is the definitive biography of LeBron James.",0
454,Video shows Louisville police under fire from bank shooter,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Police body camera video released Tuesday showed the chaotic moments when police arrived at the scene of a mass shooting at a bank in downtown Louisville, as the shooter they couldn’t see from the street rained bullets down on them.

The videos, taken from two wounded officers’ lapels, offer a rare perspective of police officers responding to a massacre that killed five and injured eight others Monday. One, a rookie officer, was shot in the head within minutes of arriving at the scene, as his partner was grazed by a bullet and sought cover while still trying to take down the shooter.

Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked reporters through edited footage and still photos at a new conference Tuesday and praised the responding officers for their heroism.

They received the call of a shooting at Old National Bank at 8:38 a.m., and the two officers arrived three minutes later, according to a chronology provided by police. They hadn’t even gotten out of the patrol car when the gunman began firing on them.

“Back up, back up, back up,” one officer shouted as gunshots thundered in the background.

One still image from surveillance video showed the 25-year-old shooter, who worked at the bank, holding a rifle, wearing jeans, a blue button-down shirt and sneakers, surrounded by broken glass inside the building. He had already shot numerous people inside, and police said he set up an ambush position to attack officers as they arrived.

The front doors were glass, elevated from the sidewalk, and because of the reflection, the officers could not see the shooter inside, Humphrey said. But he could see them.

Officer Cory Galloway retrieved a rifle from the trunk of the patrol car.

“Cover for me,” he said, and they reported to dispatch that there had been shots fired.

Galloway was training rookie Officer Nickolas Wilt, who had graduated from the police academy just 10 days earlier. The videos showed them walking up the stairs toward the front door when the gunman fired a barrage of bullets.

Wilt was shot in the head, though that was not captured on video. Galloway was grazed in the shoulder, police said. His body camera showed that he fell and then took cover behind a concrete planter at the bottom of the staircase leading to the building. Sirens from the dozens of police cars coming toward them wailed in the background.

“The shooter has an angle on that officer,” he said in the video recording. “We need to get up there. I don’t know where he’s at, the glass is blocking him.”

A video taken by a bystander across the street, which police also released Tuesday, showed him darting back and forth from one side of the planter to another, trying to get a shot at the gunman.

He waited, and as other officers arrived, more gunshots rang out and glass shattered.

Galloway fired toward the gunman at 8:44 a.m., three minutes after arriving.

“I think I got him down! I think he’s down!” he shouted. “Suspect down! Get the officer!”

He advanced into the building, and shards of glass crunched under his feet. The video then showed Galloway approaching the suspect, who lay on the ground inside the lobby next to a long rifle.

“I think you can see the tension in that video,” Humphrey said Tuesday. “You can understand the stress that those officers are going through. ... They did absolutely exactly what they needed to do to save lives. Once officers arrived on scene, not another person was shot.”

Wilt was transported in the back of a police car to a hospital, Humphrey said. In the chaotic first minutes, police treated and triaged the victims inside. Humphrey said the ambulance service was short-staffed, so a police lieutenant drove the ambulance while emergency crews treated people at the scene.

Wilt was still in critical but stable condition Tuesday, according to University of Louisville Hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jason Smith.

Two of the four wounded still in the hospital had injuries that were not life-threatening, Smith said.

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said it was crucial to release the footage because “transparency is important — even more so in a time of crisis.”

Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said at a news conference that bank employee Connor Sturgeon, 25, bought the AR-15 assault-style rifle used in the attack at a local dealership on April 4.

Armed with the rifle, Sturgeon killed his co-workers — including a close friend of Kentucky’s governor — while livestreaming the attack.

“We do know this was targeted. He knew those individuals, of course, because he worked there,” Gwinn-Villaroel said, but didn’t give an indication of a motive behind the shooting.

Gwinn-Villaroel praised the “heroic actions” of officers who engaged the shooter without hesitation when they arrived.

“They went towards danger in order to save and preserve life,” she said. “They stopped the threat so other lives could be saved. No hesitation, and they did what they were called do to.”

The shooting, the 15th mass killing in the country this year, comes just two weeks after a former student killed three children and three adults at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) to the south.

In Louisville, five Old National Bank employees were killed: Joshua Barrick, 40, a senior vice president; Tommy Elliott, 63, also a senior vice president; Jim Tutt Jr., 64, a commercial real estate market executive; Juliana Farmer, 45, a loan analyst; and Deana Eckert, 57, an executive administrative officer.

The mayor urged unity as the community processes its grief, over this shooting and the many other spasms of gun violence that have stunned this city.

“We’re all feeling shaken by this, and scared and angry and a lot of other things too,” Greenberg said. “It’s important that we come together as a community to process this tragedy in particular but not just this tragedy because the reality is that we have already lost 40 people to gun violence in Louisville this year.”

455,GM passes Ford to take No. 2 spot in EV sales behind Tesla,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors rode strong first-quarter sales of the Chevrolet Bolt to bump crosstown rival Ford out of second place in the U. S. electric vehicle sales race.

But GM’s EV sales of 20,670 were still far below those of industry leader Tesla, which delivered more than 161,000 vehicles in the U. S. from January to March, according to estimates from Motorintelligence.com.

Ford sold only 10,866 EVs during the quarter, but the company said that’s largely because it had to stop making the top-selling Mustang Mach-E electric SUV while it retooled a factory in Mexico to increase production. Spokesman Said Deep said the company didn’t build Mach-Es for seven weeks during the quarter, cutting into sales.

Also, Ford was forced to stop making the F-150 Lightning electric pickup in February after a battery caught fire during a pre-delivery quality check. The problem was fixed and production resumed March 13.

Still, Ford’s EV sales rose 41% above last year’s first quarter, the company said Tuesday.

During the first quarter, GM delivered 19,700 of its top-selling EV, the Chevrolet Bolt hatchback and utility vehicle. Last year the company sold only 358 Bolts because available batteries had to be diverted to a recall of 142,000 older Bolts due to battery fires.

GM also sold 968 Cadillac Lyriq electric SUVs and two GMC Hummer EV pickups during the first quarter. Its EV sales were 44 times larger than the same quarter a year ago.

Volkswagen, which is in fourth place in U. S. EV sales with 9,758 deliveries of the ID.4 hatchback, came close to knocking Ford down two notches.

U. S. electric vehicle sales rose 48% from January through March to just over 258,000, accounting for 7.2% of new vehicle sales. Last year the EV share of the market was 5.8%, according to data gathered by Motorintelligence.",0
456,"Fiona, Ian retired from list of tropical cyclone names","MIAMI (AP) — Weather officials announced Wednesday that they’re retiring the names Fiona and Ian from the rotating list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names because of the death and destruction caused by the most recent storms with those names.

Farrah will replace Fiona on the lists, and Idris will replace Ian, the World Meteorological Organization said in a news release. Tropical cyclones are assigned names from the alphabetical list when they intensify into tropical storms with winds of 39 mph (63 kph). The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. If a season experiences more than 26 named storms, forecasters use Greek letters.

Storm names have long been used to help communicate warnings and to alert people about potentially life-threatening risks, officials said. The names are usually repeated every six years unless a storm is so deadly that the name is retired. Since the current storm-naming system was adopted in 1953, a total of 96 names have been retired from the Atlantic basin list.

Hurricane Fiona hit the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos last September before moving northward over the western Atlantic and hitting Canada as a strong post-tropical cyclone. The storm caused over $3 billion in damage across the Caribbean and Canada, and was responsible for 29 direct and indirect fatalities.

Days after Fiona’s passing, Ian hit western Cuba as a major hurricane and made landfall in southwestern Florida as a Category 4 storm, causing massive storm surge and flooding. Ian was responsible for over 150 direct and indirect deaths, and over $112 billion in damage in the U. S. It was the costliest hurricane in Florida’s history and the third costliest in the U.S.",0
457,Wind turbine lights curtailed under bill headed to governor,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Flashing red lights atop wind turbines would be curtailed to improve nighttime views under a bill that has been sent to the governor.

If signed by Democrat Gov. Laura Kelly, it would require installation of light-mitigating technology on new and existing wind farms, The Topeka Capital-Journal reports.

The aircraft detection lighting system technology would turn off the lights except for when aircraft are near. Aircraft aren’t near a wind farm about 97% of the time the lights are blinking, said Rep. Lisa Moser, R-Wheaton.

“This bill came about because there are thousands of Kansans who see red blinking lights every three seconds, 24 hours a day,” Moser said, “and this is legislation that will mitigate that.”

Kansas has about about 4,000 turbines now with plans to add 6,000 more, Moser said.

It could take years for the new systems to be installed, with new developments required to comply first.

Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, said a radar system is about $1.5 million, and one should be enough for most developments. That’s less than the approximate $5 million cost to build a single turbine, he said.",0
458,Germany scales back cannabis liberalization after EU talks,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s government presented scaled-back plans Wednesday to liberalize the country’s rules on cannabis, including by decriminalizing possession of limited amounts and allowing members of nonprofit “cannabis clubs” to buy marijuana for recreational purposes.

In a second step, German officials also envision setting up regional test projects to sell cannabis through “commercial supply chains,” Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said. But the proposal differs from one he presented in October, which foresaw allowing the sale of cannabis to adults across the country at licensed outlets.

The German government revised the plan following talks with the European Union’s executive commission. Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir said EU law “sets us limits we must respect, but that I will also say we are pushing.”

Lauterbach had cautioned all along that the government would only proceed with its original plan if it got the green light from the EU.

Germany has allowed some patients to get cannabis as a prescription medication since 2017.

The proposed new legislation foresees legalizing the possession of up to 25 grams (nearly 1 ounce) of cannabis for recreational purposes and allowing individuals to grow up to three plants.

It would let German residents 18 and older join nonprofit “cannabis clubs” with a maximum 500 members each, which would be allowed to grow cannabis for members’ personal consumption. Individuals would be allowed to buy up to 25 grams per day, or up to 50 grams per month — a figure that would be limited to 30 grams for adults under age 21.

Membership in multiple clubs wouldn’t be allowed, and authorities could limit the number of clubs. The clubs’ costs would be covered by membership fees, which would be staggered according to how much cannabis the members use.

Özdemir said that draft legislation will be finalized this month and that “consumption will become legal this year already.” Officials hope that the first step will help push back the black market.

This fall, the government plans to map out the next step: five-year tests of regulated commercial supply chains in select regions. Lauterbach said details, including which regions would be chosen, have yet to be thrashed out.

The government wants to have the pilot projects scientifically evaluated. The ministers were optimistic that successful tests would enable them to build pressure for a change of policy at the EU level, and ultimately to clear the way for their original plan to allow licensed sales.

The feedback so far from Brussels “is on the one hand, something that perhaps disappointed us, but on the other hand also an opportunity — the opportunity to build the basis for a European cannabis policy with a well-conducted study,” Lauterbach told reporters in Berlin.

The plans will need the approval of the German parliament’s lower house, but officials said an endorsement is not needed from the upper house. That chamber represents Germany’s 16 state governments, many of which include the country’s main center-right opposition bloc.

The bloc has opposed liberalizing cannabis laws. One conservative regional official went to Brussels to lobby against Lauterbach’s initial plan.

Center-right health policy spokesman Tino Sorge told the Funke newspaper group that the government was pressing ahead with legalizing a risky drug “despite European legal hurdles, clear expert opinions and bad experiences from other countries.” He accused Lauterbach of setting the wrong priorities.

The health minister argued that Germany’s existing policies have failed. He said the government’s aim is to offer greater safety, protect consumers against contaminated and toxic products, and reduce drug-related crime.

“We are not creating a problem,” Lauterbach insisted. “We are trying to solve a problem.”

He reiterated that Germany doesn’t want to emulate the model of the neighboring Netherlands, which combines decriminalization with little market regulation.

The cannabis plan is one of several social reform projects that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s socially liberal three-party governing coalition agreed to embark on when it took office in December 2021.",0
459,"Browns end agreement with FirstEnergy, change stadium name","CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Browns ended their stadium naming rights partnership with FirstEnergy Corp. after 10 years, and will return to their lakefront stadium being called Cleveland Browns Stadium.

The sides announced the mutual agreement Thursday. Terms and conditions were not disclosed.

The original deal with FirstEnergy was worth $107 million and ran through the 2028 season, when the Browns’ lease with the city of Cleveland expires.

FirstEnergy’s partnership with the NFL franchise came under scrutiny after the utility company admitted to paying bribes to Ohio lawmakers. There had been a push by some city and state officials for the Browns to sever ties.

“We’ve had a great association with FirstEnergy for more than two decades, and we appreciate this partnership and what it has created for our team and the broader northeast Ohio community,” said Dave Jenkins, COO of Haslam Sports Group founded by Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam. “We reached this amicable agreement that is consistent with the productive relationship we have always enjoyed, and we wish FirstEnergy success with their future initiatives.”

The Browns plan to re-open bidding for their stadium’s name.

John Somerhalder, FirstEnergy interim president, said the change was in part due to a shift in the company’s priorities.

“Like the rest of northern Ohio, we remain passionate Browns fans and will cheer them on in upcoming seasons,” Somerhalder said. “We also look forward to maintaining our deep relationships with civic, arts and other organizations to bring good energy to our communities.”

The Haslams have publicly offered their commitment to renovating the 67,000-seat stadium, which was built in the same area as Cleveland Municipal Stadium and opened in 1999 when the Browns returned to the league as an expansion team.

The Haslams funded the majority of a $125 million upgrade to the stadium in 2014-15.",0
460,China says Taiwan encirclement drills a 'serious warning',"BEIJING (AP) — Recent Chinese air and sea drills simulating an encirclement of Taiwan were intended as a “serious warning” to pro-independence politicians on the self-governing island and their foreign supporters, China said Wednesday, as signs emerged that Beijing will take further action.

The three days of large-scale air and sea exercises named Joint Sword that ended Monday were a response to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s meeting with U. S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California last week during a transit visit to the U.S. China had warned of serious consequences if that meeting went ahead.

Although China said the exercises are over, it has kept up military pressure against Taiwan in the past few days and signaled it will do more.

Taiwan’s Ministry of Transportation said Wednesday it had received a notice from China’s Civil Aviation Administration that it would set up a control zone to “restrict flights” in parts of northern Taiwan from April 16-18, in effect setting up an area where flights would not be allowed to go.

“On their own, they set up a warning area to control flights within our country’s jurisdiction’s Taipei Aviation Information Region, using the excuse of aerospace activities,” the Taiwan statement said.

Taiwan said it strongly protested the notice and was able to get China to reduce the flight ban time from three days to 27 minutes on the morning of April 16. It is unclear what China plans to do at that time. Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said it was looking into the matter but could not provide further details.

China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary and regularly sends ships and warplanes into airspace and waters near the island. It defended its recent military actions Wednesday.

“The People’s Liberation Army recently organized and conducted a series of countermeasures in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding waters, which is a serious warning against the collusion and provocation of Taiwan independence separatist forces and external forces,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said at a biweekly news conference.

“It is a necessary action to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” she said.

Such missions have grown more frequent in recent years, accompanied by increasingly bellicose language from the administration of Communist Party leader Xi Jinping. Any conflict between the sides could draw in the U. S., Taiwan’s closest ally, which is required by law to consider all threats to the island as matters of “grave concern.”

On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said it tracked 35 flights by People’s Liberation Army warplanes within the last 24 hours, and eight navy vessels in the waters surrounding the island.

“There are still some navy ships and airplanes carrying out harassment in the area. We strongly condemn these deliberately threatening and provocative actions that destroy the regional peace and stability,” Sun Li-fang, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Defense Ministry, said at a press briefing Wednesday.

The vast majority of Taiwanese favor maintaining their current de-facto independent status, while Tsai has said there is no need for a formal declaration since the island democracy is already an independent nation.

Despite that, China, which does not recognize Taiwan’s government institutions and has cut off contact with Tsai’s administration, routinely accuses her of plotting formal independence with outside backing — generally seen as referring to the U. S.

“External forces are intensifying their endeavor of containing China with Taiwan as a tool,” Zhu said.

Zhu also repeated China’s assertion that its military threats are “targeted at Taiwan’s independence separatist activities and interference from external forces, and by no means at our compatriots in Taiwan.”

What that means in practical terms isn’t clear, although Beijing has long exploited political divisions within Taiwanese society, which boasts a robust democracy and strong civil liberties.

“Taiwanese compatriots should clearly recognize the serious harm that the provocation of Taiwan independence forces poses to cross-strait relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, recognize the interests, distinguish right from wrong, and stand on the correct side of history,” Zhu said.

The Chinese military issued a threat as it concluded the exercises, saying its troops “can fight at any time to resolutely smash any form of ‘Taiwan independence’ and foreign interference attempts.”

In August, after then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China conducted missile strikes on targets in the seas around Taiwan and sent warships and warplanes over the median line of the Taiwan Strait. It also fired missiles over the island that landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone in a significant escalation.

The most recent exercises focused more on air strength, with Taiwan reporting more than 200 flights by Chinese warplanes. On Monday alone, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry tracked 91 flights by Chinese warplanes.

They also featured the use of China’s first indigenously built aircraft carrier, Shandong, which launched dozens of J-15 Flying Shark fighter missions during the exercises, according to Japanese officials.

Taiwanese military officials said they noted the Shandong’s appearance in the Pacific Ocean, to Taiwan’s east, and that it was the focus of their discussions and preparedness plans.

“Everyone can see clearly China’s ability to cross the first island chain is gradually improving. The so-called ‘anti-access/area denial’ ability is gradually improving,” said Lt. Gen. Li Tian-long at a press briefing Wednesday, referring to a military concept where forces prevent an adversary from entering a specific area.

Defense experts said China would likely use the Shandong to try to prevent foreign militaries from accessing that area based on its exercise movements.

Taiwan will launch an annual large-scale drill on Thursday jointly with its disaster services and Defense Ministry, as well as local governments. Last year, the government revamped the disaster-preparedness drills to include more wartime scenarios. This year, they said, that trend would continue with war-preparedness to comprise 70% of the drills’ contents.

The developments come as the USS Nimitz Carrier group is operating in the South China Sea south of Taiwan and as American and Filipino forces hold their largest combat exercises in decades in Philippine waters across the disputed South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.

461,"Biden urges Northern Ireland to sustain peace, reap gains","BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) — President Joe Biden said Wednesday that Northern Ireland must “not go back” to the violence that scarred it for years before a U. S.-brokered peace deal 25 years ago, nudging politicians to resolve a political crisis that has left this part of the United Kingdom without a functioning government.

Speaking of the economic growth Northern Ireland has experienced since the Good Friday Agreement ended 30 years of sectarian bloodshed, Biden said: “It’s up to us to keep this going.”

On his first presidential visit to Northern Ireland, Biden dangled the prospect of more American investment to help fuel economic growth — especially if Belfast’s fractious politicians resolve a stalemate that has put their government on pause.

“The simple truth is that peace and economic opportunity go together,” Biden said during a speech at Ulster University’s new campus in Belfast. He said the glass-clad downtown building would have been unthinkable during the years of bombings and shootings known as “The Troubles.”

“Where barbed wire once sliced up the city, today we find a cathedral of learning, built of glass,” he said.

Noting that Northern Ireland’s total economic output had doubled in the quarter-century since the Good Friday peace deal was signed in April 1998, Biden urged people in Northern Ireland to “sustain the peace, unleash this incredible economic opportunity, which is just beginning.”

Biden urged all political parties to get back to work, saying “democracy needs champions” and that Northern Ireland’s future is in their hands.

“I hope the assembly and the executive will soon be restored,” he said. “That’s a judgement for you to make, not me, but I hope it happens.”

Biden’s visit was timed to mark the anniversary of the Good Friday accord, which the U. S. was key to striking. Biden credited people who were willing to “risk boldly for the future” by reaching the agreement, reminding the audience that “peace was not inevitable.”

Referring to a February gun attack on a senior police officer — blamed by authorities on Irish Republican Army dissidents opposed to the peace process — Biden said “the enemies of peace will not prevail. Northern Ireland will not go back, pray God.”

While peace has endured, Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government since the Democratic Unionist Party, which formed half of a power-sharing government, walked out a year ago over a post-Brexit trade dispute.

Biden met briefly before his speech with the leaders of the DUP and Northern Ireland’s four other main political parties.

Biden has faced mistrust from pro-British unionists because of his Irish American heritage. Sammy Wilson, a DUP lawmaker in the U. K. Parliament, told Talk TV that Biden “has got a record of being pro-republican, anti-unionist, anti-British” — a claim the White House firmly denied.

Biden’s speech carefully navigated Northern Ireland’s complex political currents, referring to both his British and his Irish ancestry, and noting the contribution to the U. S. of largely Protestant Ulster Scots as well as Irish Catholics like his own forebears.

Such things don’t go unnoticed in Northern Ireland. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said Biden’s “reference also to his own British ancestry I think indicates hopefully that we have a president that recognizes the United Kingdom is a close ally and friend of the United States.”

But Donaldson doubted whether the president’s visit would “change the political dynamic.”

“I am clear what needs to happen to make the progress that we all desire — and that is that Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom is both respected and protected, and we want to see that in law,” he said.

Michelle O’Neill from Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said Biden had “sent a clear message to the DUP” about the need to get back to work.

Biden also had tea with U. K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during his Belfast stopover. The president spent less than 24 hours in Northern Ireland before moving on to the Republic of Ireland to begin a three-day visit, scheduled to include an address to the Dublin parliament, attendance at a gala dinner and trips to two ancestral hometowns.

U. K. officials denied that the brevity of the visit amounted to a snub. Sunak said he and Biden had a “very good discussion” about investment in Northern Ireland, along with foreign policy issues.

“We’re very close partners and allies. We cooperate on a range of things,” Sunak said.

Northern Ireland’s political crisis stems, in part, from Brexit. Britain’s departure from the European Union left Northern Ireland poised uneasily between the rest of the U. K. and EU member Ireland and put the peace agreement under increased strain.

After much wrangling, Britain and the EU struck a deal in February to address the tensions over trade, eliminating many of the customs checks that had irked businesses and angered unionists. The Democratic Unionist Party, though, says the agreement doesn’t go far enough to address concerns about Northern Ireland’s place in the U. K., and has refused to return to government.

Biden, who has urged Britain and the bloc to put Brexit squabbling behind them, praised U. K. and EU leaders for trying to sort out the “complex challenges” created by Brexit.

Neil Given, a civil servant who lives in Belfast, welcomed Biden’s visit but said his “expectations are not great” that it would unblock the political logjam.

“We have prevaricated for well over a year now, and ever since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there have been numerous stoppages of the institutions of Stormont,” he said. “Whether or not Mr. Biden’s visit can in 24, 48 hours pull people together and perhaps get a message we really do need to get back to government, I don’t know.

“But hopefully he can do that. I know there is no more powerful person certainly to be over that can give out that message.”",0
462,Buccaneers GM says no intention to trade LB Devin White,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The Buccaneers have no intentions of trading star linebacker Devin White, Tampa Bay general manager Jason Licht said Thursday.

Last month, the 25-year-old who helped Tampa Bay win the Super Bowl in his second season posted cryptic messages on social media that suggested he may have played his last game with the Bucs. ESPN and NFL Network reported this week that White has requested a trade.

White is seeking a long-term contract and entering the final year of the deal he signed as the fifth overall selection in the 2019 draft. The Bucs picked up the fifth-year option that’ll pays him $11.7 million in the upcoming season.

“First of all, we all have all the respect in the world for Devin. He’s done some great things for us as a player and we look forward to more from him in the future,” Licht said during the team’s annual pre-draft media availability.

“He’s on our team. We are looking forward to this season. We’re gearing up for the season with the draft right now, free agency, and we’re looking forward to him being part of this team,” Licht added. “If he has the kind of year we all think he’s capable of, we can hopefully put this to rest and everybody’s happy.”

White, a team captain, became an immediate starter as a rookie and had a career-best nine sacks in 2020. That same year, he had a breakout postseason in helping Tom Brady lead the Bucs to the second Super Bowl title in franchise history.

He had another solid season in 2022 with 124 tackles, 5½ sacks and 16 quarterback hits, but also drew some criticism on social media in October for what was perceived as a lack of hustle on a key play during a nationally televised prime-time loss to the Baltimore Ravens.

Licht was asked if he envisioned the possibility of White holding out from training camp or maybe not playing under his current contract if the linebacker remains frustrated by a lack of progress toward a new deal.

“I can’t look into the future,” Licht said. “Like I said, we have the utmost respect for Devin. That’s part of the business world of ... this job that I don’t like. He’s a competitor, he’s a player. Everybody holds him in high regard.”",0
463,Boeing's 1st astronaut flight to space delayed until July,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Boeing’s first launch of astronauts has been delayed again, this time until July.

NASA announced the latest postponement Wednesday, saying more time is needed to certify and test the Starliner capsule’s parachute system before the spacecraft blasts off with two test pilots. Additional software testing is also underway.

Boeing already was running years behind schedule when it had to repeat its test flight without a crew to the International Space Station because of software and other problems. The first was in 2019 and the second in 2022.

“We know that what we’re doing is extremely important, launching humans in space,” Boeing’s Mark Nappi told reporters. “So we’ll take our time and we’ll make sure that everybody is confident with the work that’s been done.”

Liftoff is currently targeted for no earlier than July 21 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The Starliner capsule will ride atop United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rocket.

NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX a decade ago to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. SpaceX launched its seventh NASA crew earlier this month.

464,"Leaning on faith, Louisville mourns victims of mass shooting","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — They went to their churches on the evening after Easter — to cry, to light candles, to ask God why, on this holiday of rebirth, they must mourn so much death.

Many in Louisville turned to their faith for impromptu services Monday night, hours after a gunman killed five of his co-workers at Old National Bank downtown and injured eight others.

Hundreds gathered at Holy Trinity Catholic Church, where one of the victims, Joshua Barrick, was an active member. His family sat in the front pews, and fellow congregants hugged them and wept.

“He was so well known, he made himself known,” the Rev. Shayne Duvall said. “This community is mourning. We’re trying to wrap our heads around it.”

Barrick, 40, was a senior vice president at Old National Bank, and Duvall remembered him as a big guy with a bubbly personality. He had a wife and two young children, one girl and one boy, who attended the parish’s grade school. Barrick coached basketball for first and second graders — a charismatic, charming man who patiently wrangled the little kids.

Duvall said he spent most of the day with Barrick’s family and friends.

“They’re in shock. Everyone is just kind of walking around in a fog. Like, ‘Did this really just happen?’” he said. “This has been a beautiful morning. Who thought, ‘I’m going to work today and something like this could happen?’”

Police say the 25-year-old gunman opened fire around 8:30 a.m. Monday while livestreaming the attack on Instagram. Barrick and four of his co-workers were killed: Tommy Elliott, 63, also a bank senior vice president; Jim Tutt Jr., 64, a commercial real estate market executive; Juliana Farmer, 45, a loan analyst; and Deana Eckert, 57, an executive administrative officer.

Elliott was prominent in Democratic politics, and a close friend of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.

Beshear struggled at a news conference Monday afternoon to understand how such horror could happen the day after Easter.

“We lost four children of God today — one of whom is one of my closest friends,” Beshear said, his voice quivering. “We need love for each other. It seems like we argue so much in this country, so much anger. And I still believe that love and compassion and humanity can lead us to a better place. This is hard, it’s really hard, the day after Easter. Easter is about a rebirth, a better world, one where we’re all supposed to work together to get there.”

Elliott’s network of friends included Louisville native Lonnie Ali, widow of the late boxing great Muhammad Ali, both of whom grew up in Louisville. She pointed to Elliott’s sense of humor and commitment to his community.

“Tommy was such a warm, wonderful, funny, kind guy,” she said. “Just the sweetest person. And it’s just such a huge loss, not just to his friends and family, but to the community. Because that’s what Tommy was about. Tommy was about community.”

Elliott always rooted for the underdog and tried to use his connections to give people a boost, said former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who knew Elliott for 40 years.

Fischer said Elliott quietly took care of his aging relatives, never complaining, and was a devoted husband and father to four girls.

“You think about them going to the house tonight and he’s not there,” Fischer said. “And that’s not right.”

Kevin Luoma, who left the bank last May to take care of his elderly father, worked with several of the victims. Luoma said when his father was having a hard time at the nursing home, Elliott, who would regularly visit his mother-in-law at her own nursing home, was there to answer any questions and said he’d do anything to help.

Luoma said Deana Eckert helped organize the annual bank celebration for Thunder Over Louisville, the fireworks kickoff event before the Kentucky Derby. Eckert would put together a large food spread in the conference room where the shooting occurred.

“These people just went to work,” he said. “It’s numbing right now.”

Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said at a news conference Tuesday that he also knew Eckert, a mother of two, who died at the hospital late Monday evening.

“Deana was a very kind and very thoughtful person. She was a wonderful woman who will be missed,” he said. “Her death means another family in mourning and adds yet another layer of tragedy to this moment.”

U. S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville native, spoke of the city’s reputation as “the biggest small town in America.” He said he calls it “Louisvillage” because everyone is connected to just about everyone else, compounding the grief echoing across the city.

The loss swept across the state, too.

In Henderson, Kentucky, 130 miles (209 kilometers) west of Louisville, friends and family of Juliana Farmer were still in disbelief Tuesday, remembering her as a caring person who was always there to offer support when they needed her.

Farmer recently moved from Henderson to Louisville for her job as a loan analyst at the bank.

“Her soul was so beautiful,” family friend Lori Brooks McGuire told The Associated Press. “She would talk to anybody. You just enjoyed her.”

McGuire said Farmer had just come back from a beach vacation and was excited to learn about her fifth grandchild. On Facebook Sunday, Farmer had written that her heart was happy about the new addition to her family.

“I’m mad because he took a good person away from this world,” McGuire said of the shooter. “She did not have to go so soon.”

Twenty-five miles (40 kilometers) east of Louisville, LaGrange Mayor John Black said he knew Jim Tutt Jr., who had volunteered for years on an economic development board in Oldham County, adjacent to Louisville. Tutt helped the mayor and other public officials with complicated financial transactions and led the board as president.

“He always wanted to volunteer to be a part of our city and help out,” said Black, who appointed Tutt to the board. But Tutt wasn’t an ordinary volunteer; he had great negotiating skills and deep knowledge of land development deals that made him critical to the board’s success, Black said.

“Jim was my go-to person that I had all the faith and trust in,” he said. Tutt was president of the board for about six years before stepping down last year, according to Black.

Rep. McGarvey also had connections to the victims. The maid of honor at his wedding — whose children are his godchildren — called him from Joshua Barrick’s home Monday. She is close with the family, and said his wife hadn’t heard from him. She asked McGarvey to find out if he was alive. McGarvey called the police, then had to call her back to say he wasn’t on the list of survivors.

“She had to tell their two small children that their father would never come home from work,” McGarvey said.

At Barrick’s church Monday evening, the priest told a story of the last time he spoke to him.

Barrick had asked for a meeting to talk about the church’s new initiatives. Duvall said the last thing Barrick said to him was: “Father, I’ll do whatever you ask. You can count on me.”

The church placed a photo of Barrick with a wide smile on its altar, and a second of him with his wife and two children, a young family holding each other in a field. There were five candles, for each of the four victims and, the priest noted, one for the shooter too.

Duvall prayed for all of those killed, for their souls and their families, for mercy and for peace.

“There was a shooter. There’s going to be a lot of people in this community that are angry and mad at him, and they have every right to be,” Duvall said. “But I still have to pray for his soul too.”

This story has been edited to correct that McGarvey did not know Eckert.

465,Man pleads no contest to shooting anti-abortion campaigner,"IONIA, Mich. (AP) — A western Michigan man who said he accidentally shot an 84-year-old woman campaigning against abortion rights at his home has pleaded no contest to assault and two other charges, records show.

The shooting occurred in September in Ionia County. Richard Harvey, 75, said Joan Jacobson was talking to his wife about opposing a constitutional amendment on the November ballot and had refused to leave.

Harvey pleaded no contest Monday to assault, careless discharge of a gun and reckless use of a gun, according to online records. A no-contest plea is treated like a conviction at sentencing.

Messages seeking comment were left for the prosecutor and Harvey’s attorney Tuesday.

Harvey last year told WOOD-TV that his shotgun fired when he tried to knock away Jacobson’s clipboard. Jacobson was treated at a hospital for a shoulder wound.

“I think he knew what he was doing, and I think it was intentional,” she said in September.",0
466,Mark Bowden writes gripping story of Baltimore gang,"“Life Sentence: The Brief and Tragic Career of Baltimore’s Deadliest Gang Leader,” by Mark Bowden (Atlantic Monthly Press).

Mark Bowden transported us to Mogadishu, Somalia, for a brutal 1993 battle targeting elite American forces in “Black Hawk Down” and to Teheran for an inside look at the 1979 Iran hostage crisis in “Guests of the Ayatollah.”

In his latest book, “Life Sentence: The Brief and Tragic Career of Baltimore’s Deadliest Gang Leader,” Bowden offers a ground level view of a different kind of battle in the city nicknamed Bodymore, Murderland, for its pervasive violence.

The masterful yarn is a riveting true narrative about an FBI investigation that landed eight criminal bosses behind bars in the city profiled in the popular American television crime drama “The Wire.”

The most notorious of all the gangsters was Montana Barronette, head of the group known as “Trained to Go,” or TTG, that spread terror across the 72 blocks of decrepit row houses in the deadly West Baltimore community known as Sandtown.

Using his exclusive access to FBI files and his knowledge of the city, Bowden paints a vivid picture of life in Baltimore’s oldest Black neighborhood just 10 miles (6 kilometers) but otherwise a world away from the white suburbs where he grew up.

In Sandtown, residents live under the weight of the past — slavery, segregation, redlining and other discrimination blocking them from moving into more affluent areas with better homes and schools and a path to a better life. Bowden thus argues the neighborhood’s teenagers are largely normal kids who have been thrust into an abnormal, hyperviolent environment — but he doesn’t forgive them for the violence they commit.

Barronette grew up little better than an orphan, his father deported back to his native Jamaica and his mother immersed in the local drug business known as “The Game.”

His grandmother tried to use strict rules and weekly church services to prevent the young boy known as Tana and his siblings from ending up “on the corner,” but to no avail.

Tana was 9 years old, just 65 pounds (29.4 kilograms) and barely able to see over the top of a steering wheel, when he was arrested the first time, for stealing a car.

As he and his contemporaries grew into adolescence, the opportunities The Game offered for new sneakers, gold chains and hot women were tempting in a neighborhood where fatalism came naturally and the sight of a body on the street was as common as an ice cream truck driving by.

Barronette rose to astonishing influence over his patch of the city. State and federal authorities investigating him and his gang soon realized they weren’t just looking at a massive drug business, but also a killing operation in which rivals and snitches were shot dead for a price.

Gang members celebrated their violent exploits on social media. Popular gangster rap songs mirrored the killings they carried out.

By the time he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2019, Barronette had been nicknamed “Baltimore’s Number One Trigger Puller” for participating in a violent racketeering enterprise that committed eight murders — including six he personally participated in — as well as drug trafficking and witness intimidation.

Barronette is now serving his sentence in Louisiana, unlikely to ever see his conviction or sentence overturned, Bowden writes.

But it’s still business as usual in the hardscrabble pockets of Baltimore as new gangsters set up shop on the corners, struggling like Maryland blue crabs in a bucket, pulled back down by the others when they reach the rim.",0
467,US chip controls threaten China's technology ambitions,"BEIJING (AP) — Furious at U. S. efforts that cut off access to technology to make advanced computer chips, China’s leaders appear to be struggling to figure out how to retaliate without hurting their own ambitions in telecoms, artificial intelligence and other industries.

President Xi Jinping’s government sees the chips that are used in everything from phones to kitchen appliances to fighter jets as crucial assets in its strategic rivalry with Washington and efforts to gain wealth and global influence. Chips are the center of a “technology war,” a Chinese scientist wrote in an official journal in February.

China has its own chip foundries, but they supply only low-end processors used in autos and appliances. The U. S. government, starting under then-President Donald Trump, is cutting off access to a growing array of tools to make chips for computer servers, AI and other advanced applications. Japan and the Netherlands have joined in limiting access to technology they say might be used to make weapons.

Xi, in unusually pointed language, accused Washington in March of trying to block China’s development with a campaign of “containment and suppression.” He called on the public to “dare to fight.”

Despite that, Beijing has been slow to retaliate against U. S. companies, possibly to avoid disrupting Chinese industries that assemble most of the world’s smartphones, tablet computers and other consumer electronics. They import more than $300 billion worth of foreign chips every year.

The ruling Communist Party is throwing billions of dollars at trying to accelerate chip development and reduce the need for foreign technology.

China’s loudest complaint: It is blocked from buying a machine available only from a Dutch company, ASML, that uses ultraviolet light to etch circuits into silicon chips on a scale measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Without that, Chinese efforts to make transistors faster and more efficient by packing them more closely together on fingernail-size slivers of silicon are stalled.

Making processor chips requires some 1,500 steps and technologies owned by U. S., European, Japanese and other suppliers.

“China won’t swallow everything. If damage occurs, we must take action to protect ourselves,” the Chinese ambassador to the Netherlands, Tan Jian, told the Dutch newspaper Financieele Dagblad.

“I’m not going to speculate on what that might be,” Tan said. “It won’t just be harsh words.”

The conflict has prompted warnings the world might decouple, or split into separate spheres with incompatible technology standards that mean computers, smartphones and other products from one region wouldn’t work in others. That would raise costs and might slow innovation.

“The bifurcation in technological and economic systems is deepening,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore said at an economic forum in China last month. “This will impose a huge economic cost.”

U. S.-Chinese relations are at their lowest level in decades due to disputes over security, Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong and Muslim ethnic minorities, territorial disputes and China’s multibillion-dollar trade surpluses.

Chinese industries will “hit a wall” in 2025 or 2026 if they can’t get next generation chips or the tools to make their own, said Handel Jones, a tech industry consultant.

China “will start falling behind significantly,” said Jones, CEO of International Business Strategies.

Beijing might have leverage, though, as the biggest source of batteries for electric vehicles, Jones said.

Chinese battery giant CATL supplies U. S. and Europe automakers. Ford Motor Co. plans to use CATL technology in a $3.5 billion battery factory in Michigan.

“China will strike back,” Jones said. “What the public might see is China not giving the U. S. batteries for EVs.”

On Friday, Japan increased pressure on Beijing by joining Washington in imposing controls on exports of chipmaking equipment. The announcement didn’t mention China, but the trade minister said Tokyo doesn’t want its technology used for military purposes.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, warned Japan that “weaponizing sci-tech and trade issues” would “hurt others as well as oneself.”

Hours later, the Chinese government announced an investigation of the biggest U. S. memory chip maker, Micron Technology Inc., a key supplier to Chinese factories. The Cyberspace Administration of China said it would look for national security threats in Micron’s technology and manufacturing but gave no details.

The Chinese military also needs semiconductors for its development of stealth fighter jets, cruise missiles and other weapons.

Chinese alarm grew after President Joe Biden in October expanded controls imposed by Trump on chip manufacturing technology. Biden also barred Americans from helping Chinese manufacturers with some processes.

To nurture Chinese suppliers, Xi’s government is stepping up support that industry experts say already amounts to as much as $30 billion a year in research grants and other subsidies.

China’s biggest maker of memory chips, Yangtze Memory Technologies Corp., or YMTC, received a 49 billion yuan ($7 billion) infusion this year from two official funds, according to Tianyancha, a financial information provider.

One was the government’s main investment vehicle, the China National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, known as the Big Fund. It was founded in 2014 with 139 billion yuan ($21 billion) and has invested in hundreds of companies.

The Big Fund launched a second entity, known as the Big Fund II, in 2019 with 200 billion yuan ($30 billion).

In January, chip manufacturer Hua Hong Semiconductor said Big Fund II would contribute 1.2 billion yuan ($175 million) for a planned 6.7 billion yuan ($975 million) wafer fabrication facility in eastern China’s Wuxi.

In March, the Cabinet promised tax breaks and other support for the industry. It gave no price tag. The government also has set up “integrated circuit talent training bases” at 23 universities and six at other schools.

“Semiconductors are the ‘main battlefield’ of the current China-U. S. technology war,” Junwei Luo, a scientist at the official Institute of Semiconductors, wrote in the February issue of the journal of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Luo called for “self-reliance and self-improvement in semiconductors.”

The scale of spending required is huge. The global industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., or TSMC, is in the third year of a three-year, $100 billion plan to expand research and production.

Developers including Huawei Technologies Ltd. and VeriSilicon Holdings Co. can design logic chips for smartphones as powerful as those from Intel Corp., Apple Inc., South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. or Britain’s Arm Ltd., according to industry researchers. But they cannot be manufactured without the precision technology of TSMC and other foreign foundries.

Trump in 2019 crippled Huawei’s smartphone brand by blocking it from buying U. S. chips or other technology. American officials say Huawei, China’s first global tech brand, might facilitate Chinese spying, an accusation the company denies. In 2020, the White House tightened controls, blocking TSMC and others from using U.S. technology to produce chips for Huawei.

Washington threw up new hurdles for Chinese chip designers in August by imposing restrictions on software known as EDA, or electronic design automation, along with European, Asian and other governments to limit the spread of “dual use” technologies that might be used to make weapons.

In December, Biden added YMTC, the memory chip maker, and some other Chinese companies to a blacklist that limits access to chips made anywhere using U. S. tools or processes.

China’s foundries can etch circuits as small as 28 nanometers apart. By contrast, TSMC and other global competitors can etch circuits just three nanometers apart, ten times the Chinese industry’s precision. They are moving toward two nanometers.

To make the latest chips, “you need EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) tools, a very complicated process recipe and not just a couple of billion dollars but tens and tens of billions of dollars,” said Peter Hanbury, who follows the industry for Bain & Co.

“They’re not going to be able to produce competitive server, PC and smartphone chips,” Hanbury said. “You have to go to TSMC to do that.”

China’s ruling party is trying to develop its own tool vendors, but researchers say it is far behind a global network spread across dozens of countries.

Huawei said in a video on its website in December it was working on EUV technology. But creating a machine comparable to ASML’s might cost $5 billion and require a decade of research, according to industry experts. Huawei didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The day when China can supply its own EUV machine is “very far away,” said Hanbury.

468,"Pending abortion ban can’t be prevented, Montana judge rules","HELENA, Mont. (AP) — A bill to restrict abortions in Montana will become law — at least temporarily — if the governor signs it, a judge ruled.

Monday’s ruling denies a request by abortion rights advocates to preemptively block legislation that would ban the abortion method most commonly used in the second trimester.

District Court Judge Kathy Seeley said the request by Planned Parenthood of Montana was made before the bill became law, so there is nothing to block.

Montana’s Legislature approved the bill Friday. It would ban dilation and evacuation abortions, which are typically used later than 15 weeks into a pregnancy. The ban will take effect immediately if Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signs it.

Planned Parenthood argued the law is unconstitutional based on a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling that found that the state Constitution’s right to privacy includes the right to have a pre-viability abortion from a provider of the patient’s choice.

The organization asked the court to freeze the law preemptively to make sure patients wouldn’t be prevented from getting care while the court considered the case.

“The motion was simply denied as premature and we will renew it as soon as the governor takes action on the bill,” said Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana.

Fuller asked that the governor “be transparent about his plans for the bill, and when he will sign it.”

Gianforte hasn’t said if he plans to sign the bill. His administration criticized Planned Parenthood’s attempt to block the bill preemptively, saying the organization was employing “ extreme tactics.”",0
469,German officials seize cooked bats near Belgian border,"BERLIN (AP) — German officials seized cooked bats and nearly a ton of unrefrigerated fish after police stopped a van that had entered the country from Belgium, authorities said Wednesday.

Federal police said a patrol on Monday stopped the vehicle at a highway exit on the edge of the border city of Aachen, and found the bats under the fish. A vet from the local consumer protection office was sent to the scene and ordered the bats and fish confiscated. Police seized the van, which was uninsured.

The 31-year-old driver, an Ivorian citizen, faced a criminal complaint for traffic offenses and unauthorized entry because he entered the country without papers or a driver’s license, police said in a statement. He also faces administrative proceedings for violations of food hygiene rules, and local authorities were looking into whether he violated conservation laws relating to the bats.

A court in Aachen on Tuesday ordered the driver held in custody pending his handover to authorities in Italy, where he was registered as living.",0
470,Mexican ballad singer Julián Figueroa dies at 27,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican ballad singer Julián Figueroa has died at the age of 27, his mother confirmed Monday.

Figueroa was the son of actress Maribel Guardia and singer Joan Sebastian, who died in 2015. Guardia wrote that Figueroa died of a heart ailment.

Like his father, Figueroa sang northern-inspired ballads backed by a traditional band. His hits included songs like “Yo sería”, “Ay amor” and “Volaré.”

Guardia wrote in her Instagram account that her son died over the weekend.

“They found him unconscious in his room last night,” she wrote. “When the ambulance arrived and the police found him dead, there was no sign of violence. The medical report says he died of an acute heart attack.”

Figueroa was survived by his mother, and his wife, singer and actress Imelda Tuñón, and their son. Funeral plans were not immediately announced.

Joan Sebastian, one of Mexico’s great ballad singers, died in 2015 at age 64.

He was best known for sentimental love songs like “Tatuajes” and “Secreto de Amor,” sometimes set to simple guitar arrangements and sometimes sung on horseback.

Born Jose Manuel Figueroa, Sebastian had eight children with five women.",0
471,STDs are on the rise. This morning-after-style pill may help,"NEW YORK (AP) — U. S. health officials released data Tuesday showing how chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis cases have been accelerating, but doctors are hoping an old drug will help fight the sexually transmitted infections.

Experts believe STDs have been rising because of declining condom use, inadequate sex education and reduced testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Millions of Americans are infected each year. Rates are highest in men who have sex with men, and among Black and Hispanic Americans and Native Americans.

“Sexually transmitted infections are an enormous, low-priority public health problem. And they’ve been a low-priority problem for decades, in spite of the fact that they are the most commonly reported kind of infectious disease,” said Dr. John M. Douglas Jr., a retired health official who lectures at the Colorado School of Public Health.

To try to turn the tide, many doctors see promise in doxycycline, a cheap antibiotic that has been sold for more than 50 years.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is drafting recommendations for using it as a kind of morning-after pill for preventing STDs, said Dr. Leandro Mena, director of the agency’s STD prevention division.

The drug is already used to treat a range of infections. A study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine showed its potential to prevent sexually transmitted infections.

In the study, about 500 gay men, bisexual men and transgender women in Seattle and San Francisco with previous STD infections took one doxycycline pill within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Those who took the pills were about 90% less likely to get chlamydia, about 80% less likely to get syphilis, and more than 50% less likely to get gonorrhea compared with people who did not take the pills after sex, the researchers found.

The study was led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and built on a similar French study that saw promise in the idea.

“We do need new approaches, new innovations” to help bring sexually transmitted infections under control, said Dr. Philip Andrew Chan, who is consulting with the CDC on the doxycycline recommendations.

Mena, of the CDC, said there is no sign the STD trend is slowing.

Mississippi had the highest rate of gonorrhea cases, according to 2021 CDC data released Tuesday. Alaska saw a sharp increase in its chlamydia case rate that allowed it to overtake Mississippi at the top of that list. South Dakota had the highest rate of early-stage syphilis.

And Arizona had the tragic distinction of having the highest rate of cases in which infected moms pass syphilis on to their babies, potentially leading to death of the child or health problems like deafness and blindness.

Using an antibiotic to prevent these kinds of infections won’t “be a magic bullet. but it will be another tool,” said Chan, who teaches at Brown University and is chief medical officer of Open Door Health, a health center for gay, lesbian and transgender patients in Providence, Rhode Island.

Experts noted the CDC will have many factors to weigh as it develops the recommendations.

Among them: The drug can cause side effects like stomach problems and rashes after sun exposure. Some research has found it ineffective in heterosexual women. And widespread use of doxycycline as a preventive measure could contribute to mutations that make bacteria impervious to the drug, as has happened with antibiotics before.

Nevertheless, the San Francisco Department of Public Health in October became the first U. S. health department to issue guidance about doxycycline as an infection-prevention measure. And some other clinics have been been recommending the antibiotic to patients who may be at higher risk.

Derrick Woods-Morrow, a 33-year-old artist and an assistant professor at the Rhode Island School of Design, is an early adopter. Woods-Morrow, said he isn’t a fan of condoms — they can break and sometimes people slip them off during sex. But he wants to stay healthy.

About a decade ago, he started taking an anti-viral medication before sex to protect himself from HIV infection. Five years ago, a doctor told him about research into whether doxycycline might protect people from other diseases.

“I thought it was probably in my best interest to protect myself, and my partners as well,” he said. He said it’s been a positive experience and that he hasn’t tested positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis while using it.

“I feel like it’s a tool to sort of take back the sexual freedoms that someone may have lost and to really enjoy sex and interactions with people with a piece of mind,” he said.

472,"UK junior doctors begin 4-day strike, seeking hefty pay hike","LONDON (AP) — Tens of thousands of doctors walked off the job across England on Tuesday, kicking off a four-day strike billed as the most disruptive in the history of the U. K.’s public health service.

The walkout by junior doctors, who form the backbone of hospital and clinic care in the National Health Service, is due to last until 7 a.m. on Saturday.

Picket lines formed outside major hospitals and hundreds of doctors marched past the prime minister’s 10 Downing St. residence to Parliament, chanting “We are off to Australia” — in reference to doctors’ higher wages abroad.

Junior doctors — those in the first years of their careers — make up almost half of all NHS doctors. Health service bosses say as many as 350,000 scheduled operations and appointments will be canceled during the walkout. Senior doctors and other medics have had to be drafted in to cover for emergency services, critical care and maternity services.

Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, said the walkout “is going to be the most disruptive period of strike action that we’ve seen this winter, probably the most disruptive period of action in NHS history.”

The British Medical Association, the doctors’ trade union, is seeking a 35% pay raise to make up for what it says are years of below-inflation increases. The union says newly qualified medics earn just 14.09 pounds ($17) an hour — the U. K. minimum wage is just over 10 pounds an hour — though salaries rise rapidly after the first year.

“Four of my close friends went to Australia and New Zealand to work and never came back,” said Dr. Mike Andrews, standing on a picket line outside the Royal London Hospital. “I can’t leave because of my family but I am worried about how I am going to do my job in a week, a month, a year’s time when we can’t staff the wards already because they are leaving.”

Dr. Vivek Trivedi, co-chairperson of the union’s junior doctors committee, said the walkout could be stopped if Health Secretary Steve Barclay made a “credible offer” on pay. The government says it is willing to negotiate if the strike is called off, but calls the 35% demand unaffordable.

A wave of strikes has disrupted Britons’ lives for months, as workers demand pay raises to keep pace with soaring inflation, which stood at 10.4% in February.

Nurses, ambulance crews, teachers, border staff, driving examiners, bus drivers and postal workers have all walked off their jobs to demand higher pay.

Unions say wages, especially in the public sector, have fallen in real terms over the past decade, and a cost-of-living crisis fueled by sharply rising food and energy prices has left many struggling to pay their bills.",0
473,Free COVID testing will fade with US health emergency in May,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When the COVID-19 public health emergency ends in the U. S. next month, you’ll still have access to a multitude of tests but with one big difference: Who pays for them.

For the first time, you may have to pick up some or all of the costs, depending on insurance coverage and whether the tests are done at home or in a doctor’s office.

But there’s still time to get some free tests before the May 11 change, and there could still be free ones available afterward. Some state and local governments may continue to distribute free home tests through clinics, libraries and community centers. And the federal government, for now, is still sending free tests through the U. S. Postal Service to households that haven’t already received two shipments.

And don’t discount those old tests you haven’t used. The expiration date on the package may have been extended. The Food and Drug Administration’s website provides a list to check and see which tests are still good.

Here’s a look at what the end of the government’s emergency declaration on May 11 means for testing:

The biggest changes will be for over-the-counter tests, which account for the vast majority of screening in the U. S. today.

Since early 2021, the federal government has required all private insurers to cover up to eight COVID-19 tests per month. That requirement will soon go away. Coverage is also scheduled to lapse for tens of millions of seniors in the federal government’s Medicare program, though some members of Congress are pushing to extend the benefit.

While some private insurers may continue to cover all or some home tests, there will be no longer be a nationwide rule. A two-pack of tests typically costs between $20 and $24.

“What we will see is a hodgepodge of approaches by different insurance companies, which is going to make it difficult for individuals to know what they’re going to be paying,” said Christina Silcox, of the Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy, which recently issued a report on the outlook for testing.

One exception will be for those enrolled in the government Medicaid program for low-income individuals and families, who will continue to receive free tests until September 2024.

Americans can also expect to pay more for any COVID-19 tests performed at a hospital, clinic or doctor’s office.

Insurers have been barred from charging copays, or any other cost-sharing fees related to COVID-19 testing. That requirement also ends next month.

While insurers will still cover basic testing costs, some people could face new fees for a portion of the test’s price or for the services of the health professional performing it. Lab tests have typically ranged between $70 and $100 and some of that could be passed along to patients.

COVID-19 vaccines and drugs will remain free because they are not paid for through insurance, but by the federal government. One concern is that uncertainty around testing costs could lead to delays in treatment. Current treatments for high-risk patients, like Paxlovid, generally need to be taken within the first few days of symptoms to be effective.

If people are worried about testing costs, “they may wait a couple days to see if things clear up and miss that five-day treatment window,” Silcox said.

The U. S. struggled to build up its test manufacturing capacity during the first two years of the pandemic, with demand waning after each surge. Experts worry that the country could again be caught flat-footed after the federal government stops purchasing tests in bulk.

Only after the U. S. government said it would buy 1 billion tests did production stabilize, reaching a peak of 900 million monthly tests in February 2022.

“Those bulk purchases basically guaranteed the market for test manufacturers,” said Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president with the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

As of September, manufacturers were still producing over 400 million tests per month, far exceeding U. S. testing levels, according to Duke researchers.

Companies including Abbott Labs say they will be able to ramp up test production as needed. But the company declined to discuss specific production targets or how they will be impacted by the end of the health emergency.

Congress has shown little willingness to buy more tests and the Biden administration did not propose new spending in its latest budget.

“That upfront guarantee by the federal government that takes care of testing volatility won’t be there anymore,” Kates said.

The hundreds of different COVID-19 tests authorized by the Food and Drug Administration over the last three years will remain available after May 11. That’s because the FDA OK’d those products under a separate emergency measure that isn’t affected by the end of the national declaration.

Still, FDA officials have been encouraging test makers to apply for full regulatory approval, which will allow their products to stay on the market indefinitely. Last month, the FDA formally approved the first rapid COVID test.

474,Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton reveals Parkinson's diagnosis,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia announced Tuesday she has been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease but vowed to continue her work in Congress, saying, “I’m not going to let Parkinson’s stop me from being me.”

Wexton, 54, serving her third term from a competitive district in Northern Virginia suburbs near Washington, revealed the diagnosis on World Parkinson’s Day. She said in a video that she hopes to be a voice for those coping with the disease and to fight in Congress to devote greater resources toward the search for a cure.

The illness has primarily affected her speech and how her mouth moves, Wexton said. She speaks more quickly now, and the disease has affected how she walks and keeps her balance.

“What Parkinson’s is not is an untreatable disease, a cognitive impairment, or a death sentence. So please, you are welcome to empathize, but don’t feel sorry for me,” Wexton said.

Wexton, a former state senator and prosecutor, said she feels good and is focused on legislating, meeting constituents and visiting with business and school officials — “all just like normal.”

“I hope to keep serving you for many years to come,” Wexton said.

Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable movements, such as shaking, stiffness and difficulty with balance and coordination. The symptoms and rate of progression differ among individuals. Early symptoms of this disease are subtle and occur gradually, according to the National Institute on Aging.

“The treatment process is one that involves time and commitment, so you’re going to see me have good days and some days that are not so good,” Wexton said. “But I want you to know this: my head and my heart are 100% committed to serving the people of Virginia, and especially my constituents in the 10th congressional district.”",0
475,"Criminal probe focuses on school where boy, 6, shot teacher","NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — Prosecutors in the Virginia city where a 6-year-old shot his teacher in an elementary school classroom are investigating whether the “actions or omissions” of any school employees could lead to criminal charges, according to court documents released Tuesday.

Howard Gwynn, the commonwealth’s attorney in Newport News, filed a petition for a special grand jury to probe if any “security failures” contributed to the shooting at Richneck Elementary in January that seriously wounded teacher Abby Zwerner.

Gwynn wrote that an investigation could also lead to recommendations “in the hopes that such a situation never occurs again.”

Gwynn’s petition was released a day after his office charged the boy’s mother with felony child neglect and a misdemeanor count of endangering a child by reckless storage of a firearm. The child used his mother’s 9mm handgun to shoot Zwerner. Police say the weapon was legally purchased.

Last week, Zwerner filed a $40 million lawsuit against the school system, accusing school officials of gross negligence and of ignoring multiple warnings from teachers and other school employees that the boy had taken a gun to school on the day of the shooting.

Zwerner also alleges that school officials knew the boy “had a history of random violence” at school and at home, including that he “strangled and choked” his kindergarten teacher.

“Our lawsuit makes clear that we believe the school division violated state law, and we are pursuing this in civil court,” Diane Toscano, an attorney for Zwerner, said Monday.

The prosecutor’s decision to investigate school employees for any criminal activity is the latest fallout from the shooting, which sent shockwaves through Newport News, a shipbuilding city of about 185,000 people near the Chesapeake Bay.

Days after the shooting, school officials revealed that Richneck administrators suspected the child may have had a weapon, but they didn’t find it despite searching his backpack.

Parents and teachers lambasted administrators, saying students who assault classmates and staff rarely face consequences, and that Zwerner’s shooting could have been prevented if not for a toxic environment in which teachers’ concerns are ignored.

It is not the first school shooting to spark a criminal investigation into school officials, although they are quite rare, experts said. Civil suits are far more common, but have varying degrees of success.

For instance, authorities in Florida accused a former school resource officer of hiding during the Parkland school massacre in 2018. Scot Peterson was charged with negligence for not entering the building during the rampage that left 17 people dead. Peterson has said he did the best he could; his trial is scheduled to start next month.

In 2021, the families of the people killed in Parkland, most of the wounded and others reached a $25 million settlement with the Broward County school district in a negligence lawsuit.

A prosecutor in Michigan criticized Oxford High’s decision in 2021 to keep a teenager in school before he killed four students, stating that an investigation would determine if any school officials should be charged. No school employees have been charged.

A civil suit was filed over the Oxford shooting. But a judge ruled that school staff and administrators cannot be sued and dismissed Oxford Community Schools from lawsuits, citing governmental immunity.

After the massacre at Columbine High School in 1999, a federal judge threw out all but one of the lawsuits against the school district and sheriff’s office, ruling that the gunmen were responsible. The daughter of a teacher who bled to death reached a $1.5 million settlement in her lawsuit against the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.

In Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School last May, some parents filed a federal lawsuit against the school district, the school principal, the fired school police chief and others.

The police response to the shooting was sharply criticized as nearly 400 officers responded, but waited more than an hour before confronting and killing the gunman. Litigation is ongoing.

Chuck Vergon, a professor of educational law and policy at the University of Michigan-Flint, said it is rare for a teacher or school official to be charged in a school shooting because allegations of criminal negligence can be difficult to prove. More often, he said, those impacted by school shootings seek to hold school officials liable in civil court.

Vergon, who has been studying school shootings and liability for about seven years, said he thinks the increase in the number of school shootings combined with hundreds of new school safety laws passed after Parkland could lead to more civil actions to hold school officials accountable.

“Those laws begin to make more explicit the duties of schools and school districts in terms of preparing for and hopefully preventing or minimizing school shootings,” Vergon said.

In the wake of the Newport News shooting, the school board fired the district’s superintendent, and Richneck’s assistant principal resigned. The elementary school’s principal is still employed by the district but no longer holds that position.

James Ellenson, the attorney for the 6-year-old’s mother, said she has no criminal record and will turn herself in before the end of the week. Ellenson did not comment on the charges, but he has said her gun was secured on a top shelf in her closet and had a trigger lock.

The family has said the boy has an “acute disability” and was under a care plan that included his mother or father accompanying him to class every day. The week of the shooting was the first when a parent was not in class with him, the family said.

This story has been corrected to show Chuck Vergon is a professor at University of Michigan-Flint, not Michigan State University-Flint.

476,Balkans 'poisoned' by Russian disinformation,"SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — A U. S. special envoy on countering global disinformation says that countries in the western Balkan region have been “pretty seriously poisoned” by Russia’s influence campaigns.

James P. Rubin, who heads the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, traveled to North Macedonia on a tour that also includes stops in Montenegro and Albania.

“The main source of the threat in this part of the world is Russian-generated disinformation, often repeated and acting as a hub through Serbian media platforms and then repeated and promulgated here in the Western Balkans,” Rubin told a group of reporters late Tuesday in the capital, Skopje.

“I would say that (this region) is pretty seriously poisoned by primarily Russian disinformation.”

U. S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the appointment of Rubin, a 63-year-old veteran diplomat, last December, worried that disinformation campaigns engineered by Russia had intensified due to the war in Ukraine and Western support for Kyiv.

Russian President Vladimir “Putin thought that he could take over the Ukrainian government and divide Europe. He failed in all of these aspects,” Rubin said.

“But that doesn’t mean Russia isn’t continuing to try to spread the poison of disinformation and division ... designed to divide people from each other, divide countries from each other, to divide communities from each other, to bring discord.”

Rubin said he was working in coordination with many European governments and the European Union, and said the West is “just beginning to come to grips” with fighting back against the new threat.

A US federal government body, the GEC says it helps allied governments identify disinformation campaigns targeting their countries, providing assistance with analytics and research, and technology support.

A statement from the U. S. Embassy in North Macedonia said Rubin also discussed efforts by China “and other malign actors who deploy disinformation to undermine democracy and national security around the globe.”

On his final stop in Tirana, Albania, Rubin will join meetings with U. S. ambassadors from across the Western Balkans.",0
477,Spain clean energy case shakes confidence in EU investment,"MADRID (AP) — Renewable energy investors who lost subsidies promised by Spain are heading to a London court to try to claw back $125 million from the government — a decadelong dispute with ramifications for clean energy financing across the European Union.

The outcome will be closely watched by investors after the U. S. passed a new law offering incentives for homegrown green technology. Experts say the Inflation Reduction Act is already drawing clean energy investment away from EU countries like Spain, leaving the 27-nation bloc much less competitive globally.

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has proposed its own rules on allowing state aid and incentives for green investment. But those changes would not affect court cases already underway.

The lawsuit in London’s Commercial Court this week involves investors from the Netherlands and Luxembourg who poured millions into a solar plant in southern Spain in 2011. The Spanish government offered subsidies to encourage growth in renewable energy production, then controversially slashed the payments without notice as it cut costs after the 2008 financial crisis.

Spain has been sued internationally more than 50 times over the retroactive changes. It has not paid out despite losing more than 20 cases so far, according to U. N. data on international investment disputes. The EU backs Spain’s position.

“Those renewable investors — multibillion-dollar companies — are very concerned about the attitude of Spain and Europe looking forward,” said Nick Cherryman, one of the lawyers leading the case against Spain. “Why should they take risks investing in Europe given the track record?”

Spain now ranks alongside Venezuela and Russia as countries with the most unpaid debts over commercial treaty violations, according to a recent ranking compiled by Nikos Lavranos, a Netherlands-based expert in investment arbitration and EU law.

Most of the cases allege that Spain broke agreements it agreed to honor under the international Energy Charter Treaty, a legally binding agreement between 50 countries to protect companies from unfair government interference in the energy sector.

Environmental campaigners have criticised the treaty for protecting fossil fuel investment because financiers can also sue over policy changes aimed at scaling back polluting projects. However, for Spain, almost all cases relate to renewable energy.

“If you take the bigger picture, the EU is shooting itself in the foot by supporting Spain in this,” Lavranos said. “You cannot trust that they can follow through with their agreements, so I think you do shake investors’ confidence.”

He also questioned how leaving investors in the lurch over initiatives to ramp up renewable energy production aligned with recent EU initiatives like the Green New Deal, a goal for carbon neutrality by 2050 and relaxation of subsidy rules.

In 2013, the investors in Spain brought a case before the World Bank-backed International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, an arbitration body between governments and investors.

Spain in 2018 was ordered to compensate investors over its subsidy changes. Despite being told to pay out more than $1 billion by the international body, Spain has refused, citing EU rules.

Spain’s Ecological Transition Ministry said the payments “may be contrary to EU law and constitute illegal state aid.” When the government is told to make a payout, it says it notifies Brussels but that “Spain cannot pay before the commission’s decision, so it is faithfully complying with its legal obligations.”

The European Commission said the Energy Charter Treaty does not apply in disputes between member states like the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Spain, arguing EU law takes precedence. The commission says the decision to compensate investors over lost Spanish subsidies is still being studied and “the preliminary view is that the arbitration award would constitute state aid.”

Cherryman, the investors’ lawyer, said the EU thinks it “should be superior to international treaty law.” After waiting for payment for a decade and given the EU position, his team is trying to seize part of a $1 billion settlement awarded to Spain over a 2002 oil spill.

Starting Wednesday, the London court will hear Spain’s arguments that the investors should not be allowed to seize those assets in lieu of compensation they have yet to be paid.

José Ángel Rueda, a Spanish international arbitration lawyer who has represented several renewable energy investors against Spain, said the country’s reputation is at stake. Other EU members like Germany and Hungary have paid out after international disputes, opting to maintain a positive image, he said.

“Spain is not like Russia or Venezuela. It was expected to be a serious country. But the awards remain unpaid,” Rueda said. “Investors can see that Spain might not be a reliable state in terms of the rule of law.”

Following years of legal wrangling, the EU is now considering a coordinated withdrawal from the energy treaty, though that would not affect pending disputes.

“It is not possible to modernize the treaty to make it compatible with the objectives of the Paris agreement and the European Green Deal,” Spain’s Ecological Transition Ministry said.

The European Commission agreed, saying a withdrawal was “the most pragmatic way forward.”

That might simply nudge investors to look across the Atlantic, Cherryman said.

“America has been nimble, and it introduced very favorable legislation to encourage renewable investment,” he said. “They will respect my investment. Or I can take risk and go into Europe, go into Spain.”

The risk was the loss of more money for renewables, which are “a win for everybody,” Cherryman said. “We all want to see renewables being invested in and we all want a greener environment that is a safer future for our children.”",0
478,Tornado-spawning storms may get worse due to warming,"America will probably get more killer tornado- and hail-spawning supercells as the world warms, according to a new study that also warns the lethal storms will edge eastward to strike more frequently in the more populous Southern states, like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.

The supercell storm that devastated Rolling Fork, Mississippi is a single event that can’t be connected to climate change. But it fits that projected and more dangerous pattern, including more nighttime strikes in a southern region with more people, poverty and vulnerable housing than where storms hit last century. And the season will start a month earlier than it used to.

The study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society predicts a nationwide 6.6% increase in supercells and a 25.8% jump in the area and time the strongest supercells twist and tear over land under a scenario of moderate levels of future warming by the end of the century. But in certain areas in the South the increase is much higher. That includes Rolling Fork, where study authors project an increase of one supercell a year by the year 2100.

Supercells are nature’s ultimate storms, so-called “Finger of God” whoppers that are “the dominant producers of significant tornadoes and hail,” said lead author Walker Ashley, a professor of meteorology and disaster geography at Northern Illinois University. Tall, anvil-shaped and sky-filling, supercells have a rotating powerful updraft of wind and can last for hours.

Supercells spawned the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado that killed 51 people, the 2011 Joplin, Missouri, tornado outbreak that killed 161 people and the 2011 super outbreak that killed more than 320 people in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, the Mid-South.

The study used computer simulations to predict what will happen by the end of the century with different levels of global carbon pollution levels. But Ashley said that stormier future seems like it’s already here.

“The data that I’ve seen has persuaded me that we are in this experiment and living it right now,” Ashley said in an interview three days before the EF-4 tornado killed more than 20 people in Mississippi on Friday. “What we’re seeing in the longer term is actually occurring right now.”

Ashley and others said although the Mississippi tornado fits the projected pattern, it was a single weather event, which is different than climate projections over many years and a large area.

Ashley and study co-author Victor Gensini, another meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University and a longtime tornado expert, said they are watching the potential for another supercell blow-up in the Mid-South on Friday.

Past studies have been unable to forecast supercells and tornadoes in future climate simulations because they are small-scale events, especially tornadoes, that global computer models can’t see. Ashley and Gensini used smaller regional computer models and compensated for their reduced computing power by spending two years running simulations and crunching data.

Three scientists not connected to the study said it makes sense. One of them, Pennsylvania State University tornado scientist Paul Markowski, called it a promising advance because it explicitly simulated storms, compared to past research that only looked at general environments favorable to supercells.

While the study finds a general increase in supercell counts, what it mostly finds are large shifts in where and when they hit — generally, more east of Interstate 35, which runs through east central Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, and fewer to the west.

In moderate warming – less warming than the world is headed for based on current emissions – parts of eastern Mississippi and eastern Oklahoma are projected to get three more supercells every two years, with eastern Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, western Tennessee and eastern Georgia getting one more supercell every other year.

With worst-case warming — more than the world is presently on track for — the study projects similar changes but with worsening supercells over eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.

Cities that should see more supercells as warming worsens include Dallas-Fort Worth, Little Rock, Memphis, Jackson, Tupelo, Birmingham and Nashville, Ashley said.

The moderate warming simulation projects 61% more supercells in March and 46% more in April, while the more severe warming scenario has 119% more in March and 82% more in April. They see double-digit percentage point drops in June and July.

In the mid-South, including Rolling Fork, the study projects supercell activity peaking two hours later, from 6 to 9 p.m. instead of 4 to 7 p.m. That means more nighttime supercells.

“If you want a disaster, create a supercell at night where you can’t go outside and visually confirm the threat” so people don’t take it as seriously, Gensini said.

The eastward shift also puts more people at risk because those areas are more densely populated than the traditional tornado alley of Kansas and Oklahoma, Ashley and Gensini said. The population coming under more risk is also poorer and more frequently lives in mobile or manufactured homes, which are more dangerous places in a tornado.

What’s likely happening as the climate warms is the Southwest United States is getting hotter and drier, Ashley and Gensini said. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Mexico, which provides the crucial moisture for the storms, is getting hotter and the air coming from there is getting juicier and unstable.

The hot dry air from places like New Mexico puts a stronger “cap” on where storms would normally brew when air masses collide in spring time. That cap means storms can’t quite boil over as much in the Great Plains. The pressure builds as the weather front moves east, leading to supercells forming later and farther eastward, Gensini and Ashley said.

Because February and March are getting warmer than they used to be this will happen earlier in the year, but by July and August the cap of hot dry air is so strong that supercells have a hard time forming, Ashley and Gensini said.

It’s like playing with a pair of dice loaded against you, Ashley said. One of those dice is making the odds worse because of more people in the way and the other one is loaded with more supercells “increasing the odds of the perils too, tornadoes and hail.”

479,Startup makes mammoth meatball,"AMSTERDAM (AP) — Throw another mammoth on the barbie?

An Australian company on Tuesday lifted the glass cloche on a meatball made of lab-grown cultured meat using the genetic sequence from the long-extinct pachyderm, saying it was meant to fire up public debate about the hi-tech treat.

The launch in an Amsterdam science museum came just days before April 1 so there was an elephant in the room: Is this for real?

“This is not an April Fools joke,” said Tim Noakesmith, founder of Australian startup Vow. “This is a real innovation.”

Cultivated meat — also called cultured or cell-based meat — is made from animal cells. Livestock doesn’t need to be killed to produce it, which advocates say is better not just for the animals but also for the environment.

Vow used publicly available genetic information from the mammoth, filled missing parts with genetic data from its closest living relative, the African elephant, and inserted it into a sheep cell, Noakesmith said. Given the right conditions in a lab, the cells multiplied until there were enough to roll up into the meatball.

More than 100 companies around the world are working on cultivated meat products, many of them startups like Vow.

Experts say that if the technology is widely adopted, it could vastly reduce the environmental impact of global meat production in the future. Currently, billions of acres of land are used for agriculture worldwide.

But don’t expect this to land on plates around the world any time soon. So far, tiny Singapore is the only country to have approved cell-based meat for consumption. Vow is hoping to sell its first product there — a cultivated Japanese quail meat — later this year.

The mammoth meatball is a one-off and has not been tasted, even by its creators, nor is it planned to be put into commercial production. Instead, it was presented as a source of protein that would get people talking about the future of meat.

“We wanted to get people excited about the future of food being different to potentially what we had before. That there are things that are unique and better than the meats that we’re necessarily eating now, and we thought the mammoth would be a conversation starter and get people excited about this new future,” Noakesmith told The Associated Press.

“But also the woolly mammoth has been traditionally a symbol of loss. We know now that it died from climate change. And so what we wanted to do was see if we could create something that was a symbol of a more exciting future that’s not only better for us, but also better for the planet,” he added.

Seren Kell, science and technology manager at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that promotes plant- and cell-based alternatives to animal products, said he hopes the project “will open up new conversations about cultivated meat’s extraordinary potential to produce more sustainable foods, reduce the climate impact of our existing food system and free up land for less intensive farming practices.”

He said the mammoth project with its unconventional gene source was an outlier in the new meat cultivation sector, which commonly focuses on traditional livestock — cattle, pigs and poultry.

“By cultivating beef, pork, chicken, and seafood, we can have the most impact in terms of reducing emissions from conventional animal agriculture and satisfying growing global demand for meat while meeting our climate targets,” he said.

The jumbo meatball on show in Amsterdam — sized somewhere between a softball and a volleyball — was for show only and had been glazed to ensure it didn’t get damaged on its journey from Sydney.

But when it was being prepared — first slow baked and then finished off on the outside with a blow torch — it smelled good.

“The folks who were there, they said the aroma was something similar to another prototype that we produced before, which was crocodile,” Noakesmith said. “So, super fascinating to think that adding the protein from an animal that went extinct 4,000 years ago gave it a totally unique and new aroma, something we haven’t smelled as a population for a very long time.”",0
480,Newly active Texas sinkhole unearths forgotten fears in some,"DAISETTA, Texas (AP) — When the massive sinkhole first appeared in Daisetta in May 2008, some residents had feared it might engulf their small Southeast Texas town.

But after growing close to 600 feet (183 m) across and 75 feet (23 m) deep, it stabilized, swallowing up some oil tanks and several vehicles but sparing nearby homes. Some residents used humor to calm their fears, making “Sinkhole de Mayo” T-shirts, a reference to Cinco de Mayo. For others, the sinkhole, which eventually filled with water, became a new fishing spot.

“It was just a pond after that, just a story that we told our kids. We just learned how to live with it,” Krystal Parrish, one of the approximately 1,000 residents who live in the town located about 60 miles (97 km) northeast of Houston, said Tuesday.

But earlier this month, city officials announced the sinkhole had expanded after a long hibernation, renewing fears from some residents. Officials say there hasn’t been any significant expansion since the new growth was detected April 2, but they’re monitoring the sinkhole and keeping the public informed. In a preliminary report released Thursday, state researchers said the expansion was actually a new and smaller sinkhole that formed adjacent to the one from 2008.

“I don’t think (residents) should panic or anything. But it’s something that they should watch,” said Richard Howe, a private geologist with Houston-based Terra Cognita who’s helping Daisetta officials monitor the sinkhole.

But Parrish and some other residents say the city hasn’t sufficiently updated the public.

“I’m not gonna lie, I’m pretty creeped out by it because it’s twice in my lifetime and my house is like a quarter mile from the sinkhole,” said Parrish as she watched her son during a high school baseball game.

Daisetta sits on a salt dome, a natural formation created below the ground over millions of years where oil brine and natural gas accumulate.

Salt domes create good conditions where oil can migrate and accumulate, Howe said. This was the reason Daisetta became a booming oil town in the early 1900s. The sustained oil drilling along the salt dome over decades could have contributed to creating the sinkhole, Howe said. Investigators had also considered saltwater waste that was being stored underground by an oil and gas waste well business next to the sinkhole as a possible cause.

But Howe said a cause for the 2008 sinkhole was never determined. A more comprehensive study could be done, but it would be costly and “a small town like this is not flush with cash,” he said. Howe, who also helped Daisetta in 2008, is working for the city on a volunteer basis.

Howe suggested the underground cavern in the salt dome that first collapsed and formed the 2008 sinkhole likely expanded, creating a new sinkhole that seems to have merged with the original one.

In the preliminary report, the Bureau of Economic Geology, a research unit at the University of Texas, said the new sinkhole has a diameter of about 230 feet (70 m) and is about 30 feet (9 m) deep. The report said there was no indication the new sinkhole had impacted Farm-to-Market Road 770, the main roadway through the town.

The new sinkhole may or may not expand much, but more study is recommended “to better understand the cause ... to minimize risk associated with similar possible future events,” according to the report by the bureau, which functions as the State Geological Survey.

Sinkholes tend to be common in regions where soluble rocks, including salt domes and limestone, can be dissolved by groundwater, according to the U. S. Geological Survey. Florida, for example, sits above limestone and is highly susceptible to sinkholes.

Howe said officials have placed steel posts 50 feet (15 m) apart in a pasture area near the sinkhole to monitor any changes in their elevation and to act “as an early warning if this thing continues to move south toward homes and buildings.”

“This thing could be like this for another 15 years ... or it could be 100 years, or it could change tomorrow. It’s just no way to predict it,” said Howe, adding nothing can be done to stop the sinkhole if it continues expanding.

The expanding sinkhole is located near the high school campus, as well as various homes and a new Family Dollar/Dollar Tree store that opened just days after the new growth was discovered.

At the site of the shuttered oil and gas waste well business that’s been taken over by the expanding sinkhole, a road that connected one end of the location to the other has been washed away. Several large tanks, which officials say are empty, were in the water. A portion of a metal warehouse was being consumed by the sinkhole, while large cracks could be seen on the ground around the building.

Officials with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, had relocated six large tanks with an unknown substance from the cracked earth and asphalt near the sinkhole so they could be tested, the TCEQ said in an email Wednesday.

“Due to the imminent threats to human health and the environment, TCEQ and U. S. EPA proceeded quickly to mitigate the potential for chemical releases,” TCEQ said.

Daisetta resident Alexis Laird, 25, a mother of three kids, said she hadn’t really thought much about the sinkhole since first seeing it as a fourth-grader in 2008. Now she’s worried about it, as her apartment is located less than two blocks away from it. She said she wants officials to be more proactive in their updates to residents.

“It doesn’t matter whether it’s good or bad or a minuscule amount of information. ... Tell the people that live here,” she said.

Daisetta City Secretary Joan Caruthers said officials are working to set up a website that will provide updates and are planning to hold a public meeting in the future. Caruthers said they want “a little more information” before scheduling the public meeting.

After the sinkhole appeared in 2008, county commissioners asked the state to set up monitoring devices that could be an early warning system.

Caruthers said she’s not aware if any such monitoring system from the state was ever set up. The sinkhole was monitored for several years after 2008, but there was no recent active monitoring by the city, she said.

Christine Bautsch, Laird’s mother, described Daisetta as a friendly town where “everybody pretty much knows everybody” and residents come together in a time of crisis, including a growing sinkhole.

“There is really good people here and they take care of each other. ... We’ll pull together,” Bautsch said. ___ Follow Juan A. Lozano on Twitter at https://twitter.com/juanlozano70.",0
481,JetBlue adds Amsterdam in effort to compete with big rivals,"NEW YORK (AP) — JetBlue said Tuesday it will begin flying between New York and Amsterdam this summer after a Dutch court blocked a government effort to limit flights at Schiphol Airport.

JetBlue currently flies to London and will start service to Paris in June. The Amsterdam flights will put the New York-based airline in head-to-head competition against the alliance of bigger rivals Delta Air Lines and KLM.

“This route is long overdue for some competition,” said JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes.

JetBlue said it eventually plans to add flights between Boston and Amsterdam, but it did not give a timetable.

JetBlue has seeking approval to fly to Amsterdam for some time but was unable to get anything more than temporary takeoff and landing slots this summer, which it said wasn’t good enough. The airline reversed course on Tuesday, however, saying that a court ruling against the Dutch government’s plan to reduce flights at Schiphol gives it confidence to enter the market.

Most airlines use big, two-aisle planes for transatlantic flights, but JetBlue will use a long-range version of the smaller, single-aisle Airbus A321 to reduce costs.",0
482,Their stories were lost to slavery. Now DNA is writing them,"CHARLESTON, S. C. (AP) — In the 1700s, a boy was born into slavery in Colonial America. He spent his life working in the coastal city of Charleston, South Carolina. And when he died in middle age, he was buried alongside 35 other slaves.

That’s the likely history that researchers have uncovered for the man — there’s no written record for him or the others buried at the long-forgotten site. Their names have been lost, along with any details of their lives. But their stories are now being told through what was left behind: bones, teeth and, especially, DNA.

In recent decades, advances in DNA research have allowed scientists to use ancient remains and peer into the lives of long-dead people. In Charleston, that’s meant tracing some of the African roots that were cut off by slavery.

“We’re bringing their memory back to life,” said Raquel Fleskes, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut who studied the remains. “This is a way of restoring dignity to individuals that should’ve always had this dignity.”

The Charleston project started a decade ago, when construction workers unearthed the remains beneath the grounds of the Gaillard Center, an arts venue in the city that was going through an expansion.

Dating back to the second half of the 18th century, the remains are believed to be mostly from enslaved people of African descent who lived nearby. A few of them were likely among the estimated 175,000 Africans brought through Charleston’s port, a hub for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

The city reburied the remains at the site, where a memorial fountain is planned. But with few recorded details available, community members were also interested in using science to learn more about the people, Fleskes said.

So, the Anson Street African Burial Ground Project was born, and researchers started looking for clues.

Artifacts from the site showed that the bodies were buried with care, explained Theodore Schurr, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania who worked on the research. Some of them had beads in their hair or coins over their eyes. Minerals in their teeth showed only a few had been born in Africa, while most had likely been born into slavery in Charleston or nearby.

Scientists also coaxed DNA from the centuries-old skeletons — drilling small samples of bones and teeth, grinding them up into powder, mixing them into a solution and filtering out everything but the human DNA. They were able to get some genetic material for most of the 36 and full genomes for half of them, which were compared with the genetic makeup of people in Africa today.

Results showed that they had ties to many different places along the West African coast, from Gambia to Gabon. They were mostly male, and largely died as adults. Their ages ranged from a child under 3 to a man over 50.

Their DNA showed they were unrelated, aside from one possible mother-child pair.

Researchers also offered DNA tests to 78 African Americans living in the Charleston area today, said La’Sheia Oubré, who led community education for the project. So far, they haven’t found any direct relatives of those buried at Anson Street.

Still, Oubré — who took a DNA test — said she and other community members consider them family.

“They have such a story to tell,” she said. “And because they’re not related to us by blood, it doesn’t mean that it’s not our moral responsibility to take care of them.”

Since it became possible to sequence DNA from ancient remains, the technology has taken us back to the days of Neanderthals and mammoths.

Some researchers have been using ancient DNA to fill gaps in our more recent history. That includes cases like Charleston as well as the New York African Burial Ground Project, which revealed new details about Africans and their descendants in 18th century Manhattan.

There aren’t many records for these people from the time, said Michael Blakey, an anthropologist who served as the scientific director on the New York project. The records that are available focuses on things like how much enslaved people cost and what kinds of laws were used to control them, he said.

Oubré said it’s been powerful to have DNA reveal some of the “stolen history” of those buried in her city.

“To be able to know all of this, it’s still mind-blowing to me,” Oubré said. “It still just warms my heart that we’re able to find out where we come from — where we really come from.”

In some cases, ancient DNA research has also challenged the history that’s been written about certain communities.

Growing up in Puerto Rico, anthropologist Maria Nieves-Colon was taught that the Indigenous peoples of the islands were quickly wiped out by European colonization, and didn’t pass on their genes to people on the island today. But after looking at ancient remains from the island in a 2020 study, Nieves-Colon found genetic links did exist between those Indigenous groups and modern-day Puerto Ricans.

Research like this shows “we need to think more critically about what was left in the historical record,” said Nieves-Colon, who is now at the University of Minnesota.

While ancient DNA can be a powerful tool for uncovering history, it needs to be used with caution, researchers note, especially when it comes to vulnerable groups.

Unlike research on living subjects, work on recovered human remains doesn’t require scientists to get consent, explained Krystal Tsosie, a geneticist at Arizona State University. And in the past, most researchers haven’t consulted with groups like Native tribes or African descendants before studying the remains of possible ancestors.

But this kind of work does impact living communities and they should be part of the conversation, researchers said.

“In many ways, it’s about power,” Blakey said. “The right to tell your story.”

In Charleston, project leaders asked community members for their permission before every step, Oubré said. The names of the 36 had been lost to history and the team gave them new ones — like Coosaw, Welela, Isi and Kuto — so they wouldn’t be just numbers on a burial plot, said Joanna Gilmore, director of research and interpretation with the Anson Street project.

Now, the new memorial is set to honor the lives of these 36 individuals, as well as the thousands of enslaved people who helped build Charleston, project leaders said.

The memorial will be at the Gaillard Center, where a small plaque now marks the site where the remains were uncovered. It will include a fountain circled by pairs of bronze hands cast from current residents, and a base made of soil from other African burial grounds across the city, Gilmore explained.

Last month at an art studio, residents created a copy of their hands, leaning elbow-deep into buckets of pink goo that hardened into molds. Artist Stephen Hayes poured liquid plastic into the molds to make shiny white replicas.

Adrian Swinton got her hands cast to represent a woman given the name Tima. Swinton is descended from slaves herself, and said the memorial was a powerful way to remember their sacrifices.

“Her legacy hasn’t gone unnoticed,” Swinton said. “And she wasn’t property. She was a human. She was part of my Black history.”

Retiree Ervin McDaniel Jr. was giddy as he held up his freshly made plastic hands, which will be cast in bronze to represent the boy born into slavery who was given the name Fumu.

“They lived, they worked, they died — and now they’re being remembered forever,” McDaniel said

483,Concerned US states start stockpiling abortion drugs after court ruling,"BOSTON (AP) — A growing number of states led by Democratic governors are stockpiling doses of drugs used in medication abortions, amid fears that a court ruling could restrict access to the most commonly used method of abortion in the U. S.

Massachusetts has purchased enough doses of the drug mifepristone — one of two drugs used in combination to end pregnancies — to last for more than a year, Democratic Gov. Maura Healey said Monday. California has secured an emergency stockpile of up to 2 million pills of misoprostol, the other drug used in abortion medication, Gov. Newsom, also a Democrat, announced.

And in Washington state, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee announced last week that the state purchased 30,000 doses of the generic version of mifepristone — which he said is enough to last the state’s residents three years. The shipment arrived in late March.

“Abortion is still legal and accessible here in California and we won’t stand by as fundamental freedoms are stripped away,” Newsom said Friday.

The actions come as U. S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee in Amarillo, Texas, overruled decades of scientific approval Friday and put on hold federal approval of mifepristone.

The judge stayed his ruling for a week so federal authorities could file a challenge.

The Biden administration slammed the ruling and on Monday appealed the decision, saying it would thwart the U. S. Food and Drug administration’s scientific judgment and “severely harm women, particularly those for whom mifepristone is a medical or practical necessity.”

Adding to the confusion was a second opinion also released on Friday by District Judge Thomas O. Rice, an Obama appointee, directing U. S. authorities not to make any changes that would restrict access to the drug in at least 17 states where Democrats sued in an effort to protect availability.

Healey said the Kacsmaryk ruling threatens access to the medication even in states supportive of abortion rights like Massachusetts.

“It harms patients, undermines medical expertise, and takes away freedom. It’s an attempt to punish, to shame, to marginalize women. It’s unnecessary,” Healey said, surrounded by fellow Democratic lawmakers including U. S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse.

“It is terrible. It is terrible,” she added.

Newsom said the ruling by Kacsmaryk “ignores facts, science, and the law,” and puts the health of millions of women and girls at risk.

Inslee said it’s important for states to take steps to ensure access to the drug.

“After we announced our actions last week to protect access to mifepristone, it’s heartening to see other states doing the same,” Inslee wrote on Twitter on Monday. “To be clear: no matter the outcome of the TX case, WA’s laws ensure we will be able to sell and distribute this medication.”

The 15,000 doses in Massachusetts were purchased by the University of Massachusetts-Amherst at Healey’s request.

Massachusetts health care providers have also agreed to buy additional quantities of mifepristone, according to Healey, who said the administration is dedicating $1 million to help providers contracted with the Department of Public Health to pay for the doses.

While there are no plans yet in Connecticut to stockpile mifepristone, Attorney General William Tong said Monday that he has been contacting major pharmacy chains to remind them the drug is legal and they should not be influenced by pressure from GOP attorneys general in other states.

”(I’m) obviously deeply disappointed that my colleagues have taken that action,” he said. “We’re pushing back on that. We’re in communication with all the big pharmacy chains, advising them of their rights and obligations here in Connecticut.”

Also on Friday, Healey signed an executive order expanding a 2022 law meant to build a legal firewall around abortion services — protecting health care providers, patients and pharmacists from out-of-state investigations into medication abortions. The law was signed after the U. S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.",0
484,Justice Department appeals Texas abortion pill order,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Justice Department on Monday appealed a Texas court ruling that would halt approval of a drug used in the most common method of abortion in the U. S., calling the decision “extraordinary and unprecedented.”

If allowed to stand, the order issued last week by U. S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk could restrict access to the abortion medication mifepristone as early as Friday, unsettling abortion providers less than a year after the reversal of Roe v. Wade already dramatically curtailed abortion access.

The Food and Drug Administration in 2000 granted approval to mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortion in the United States. There is essentially no precedent for a lone judge overruling the FDA’s medical decisions, and pharmaceutical executives signed a letter Monday warning that the ruling could endanger other medications.

In appealing to the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Biden administration said Kacsmaryk’s “extraordinary and unprecedented order” should remain on hold while it challenges the decision.

“If allowed to take effect, the court’s order would thwart FDA’s scientific judgment and severely harm women, particularly those for whom mifepristone is a medical or practical necessity,” the Justice Department wrote.

Kacsmaryk, an appointee of Donald Trump, issued his decision Friday but ruled it would not take effect for seven days — meaning the end of this week barring another court stepping in.

Adding to the uncertainty was unresolved confusion Monday over a conflicting order by a different federal judge in the state of Washington, who within 20 minutes of Kacsmaryk’s decision issued a separate ruling that directed U. S. authorities not to make any changes that would restrict access to the drug in at least 17 states where Democrats had sued.

Underlining that confusion, the Justice Department on Monday separately asked the federal court in Washington state for clarity, given the competing orders.

The abortion drug has been widely used in the U. S. since securing FDA approval. The other drug used for abortion medication in the United States is misoprostol, which is also used to treat other medical conditions and was not part of Kacsmaryk’s decision.

Many providers must wait and see what happens in the courts between now and Friday before deciding what to do next, Jennifer Dalven, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project, told reporters.

If the Texas court’s ruling takes effect, some providers are prepared to pivot to a misoprostol-only regimen while others may transition to only surgical abortions.

“We don’t know exactly what will happen,” Dalven said. “What we do know is that there will be significant confusion and chaos as providers try to provide the best care they possibly can for their patients.”

The lawsuit in Texas was filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom, which was also involved in the Mississippi case that led to Roe v. Wade being overturned. At the lawsuit’s core is the allegation that the FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone was flawed because it did not adequately review its safety risks.

Courts have long deferred to the FDA on issues of drug safety and effectiveness. But the agency’s authority faces challenges in a post-Roe legal environment in which abortions are banned or unavailable in 14 states, while 16 states have laws specifically targeting abortion medications.

Among the pharmaceutical executives who signed the petition criticizing Kacsmaryk’s ruling was Albert Bourla, CEO of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which has produced the biggest-selling COVID-19 vaccine and treatment in the U. S.

The document warns that the decision diminishes the FDA’s authority over drug approvals. A Pfizer spokeswoman verified for The Associated Press that Bourla signed the letter.

“If courts can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone,” the letter states.

485,Grand Canyon delays opening of North Rim due to snowfall,"NORTH RIM, Ariz. (AP) — The public will have to wait a little longer to visit the North Rim at Grand Canyon National Park this year.

Like other parts of the West, northern Arizona received an abundance of snow over the winter, and park officials say pushing back the opening from mid-May to June 2 will give them more time to plow the main state road that leads to the rim and allow staff to reopen visitor facilities.

“We appreciate the patience and cooperation of our neighbors and visitors with this delay as our partners and park staff work to open the North Rim roads, trails and facilities safely,” Superintendent Ed Keable said in a statement Friday.

According to park officials, the North Rim has received more than 250 inches (6.35 meters) of accumulated snowfall since October. That marks what is believed to be the second-snowiest on record for the North Rim since 1925, although there are some years of missing data during that time period.

Photos shared by the park showed impassable areas and snow up to the eves of one of the entrances at Grand Canyon Lodge.

The snow depth recorded on Bright Angel Point in March totaled a record 92 inches (2.34 meters). The weather station near the point is situated at an elevation of 8,339 feet (2.54 kilometers).

The North Rim typically receives an average of 126 inches (3.2 meters) of snow each year.

Park officials said the visitor station, backcountry information center and the bookstore will reopen June 2 and daily ranger-led programs will resume. Grand Canyon Lodge North Rim operations also are expected to reopen on that date, while the North Rim Campground will reopen June 9.",0
486,Fancy a dip? An Olympic reboot for Paris' toxic River Seine,"PARIS (AP) — Even before he has dipped his toes into the murky waters of Paris ′ famous but forbidden River Seine, French triathlete Thibaut Rigaudeau is already fielding questions from disbelieving friends.

“Are you scared of swimming in the Seine?” he says they ask him. “It looks disgusting.’”

For decades, it was. Though immortalized in art, literature and song, and cherished by lovers who whisper sweet nothings or tearfully part on the privacy of its banks, the river was ecologically dying. It was too toxic for most fish and for swimmers, largely useful only as a waterway for goods and people or as a watery grave for discarded bicycles and other trash. Swimming in the Seine has, with some exceptions, been off-limits since 1923.

Now, however, its admittedly unappetizing green-brown waters hide a tale of rebirth.

A costly and complex cleanup is resuscitating the Seine just in time for it to play a starring role in the 2024 Paris Olympics and, after that, for it to genuinely live up to its billing as the world’s most romantic river, one that’s actually fit again for people. And in a warming world, a renewed ability to take cooling dips in the river should help France’s capital remain liveable during increasingly frequent heat waves. It possibly might also inspire other cities to invest in reclaiming their waterways.

“It will create waves, so to speak, across the world because a lot of cities are watching Paris,” says Dan Angelescu, a scientist who is tracking the Seine’s water quality for City Hall, with regular sampling.

“It’s the beginning of a movement,” he says. “We hope so, at least.”

The Olympic deadline has supercharged a cleanup that has been decades in the making. Without the imperative of having to be ready for 10,500 Olympians in July and August next year, followed by 4,400 Paralympians, City Hall officials say it would have taken many more years to fund the multi-pronged, 1.4 billion-euro ($1.5 billion) effort. Because as well as hosting outdoor swim races, the Seine is going to be the centerpiece of Paris’ unprecedented Olympic opening ceremony. For the first time, it will take place not in a stadium setting but along the river and its banks.

So it needs to be ready. Officials have been going after homes upstream of Paris and houseboats on the Seine that were emptying their sewage and wastewater directly into the river. An Olympic law adopted in 2018 gave moored boats two years to hook up to Paris’ sewage network. Sewage treatment plants on the Seine and its tributary, the Marne, are also being improved.

And more than half a billion euros (dollars) is going into huge storage basins and other public works that will reduce the need to spill bacteria-laden wastewater into the Seine untreated when it rains. One storage facility is being dug next to Paris’ Austerlitz train station. The giant hole will hold the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools of dirty water that will now be treated rather than being spat raw through storm drains in the river.

City Hall says the water quality is already improving and that there are many more types of fish than the two or three species that were the only ones hardy enough to survive in the filth a few decades ago. It says samples taken daily last July and August in the stretch of river where Olympians and Paralympians will compete showed the water quality was overwhelmingly “good.” By their sports’ standards, that means acceptable.

Setting off from the Seine’s ornate Alexandre III bridge, triathletes will race first in 2024, with men on July 30, followed by women the next day. Then come marathon swimmers, on Aug. 8 and 9, and para-triathletes on Sept. 1 and 2.

Rigaudeau, who competed in para-triathlon at the 2021 Tokyo games, is thrilled by the prospect. He’s hoping for an early taste of the experience when Paris hosts warm-up swims in the Seine this summer to hone its readiness for 2024. It will be Rigaudeau’s first-ever dip in his home river.

“We will be the ‘testers,’” he says. “I hope we don’t get sick.”

After the games, the river should then reopen to everyone — in the summer of 2025. City Hall says five potential bathing spots are being studied within Paris itself, with others a bit further afield.

Officials hope that after so many years where swimming in the Seine was unthinkable, Parisians will start to feel that it’s safe to go back in the water when they see Olympians and Paralympians leading the way.

“It’s going to change our lives,” Rigaudeau says. “But it’s also true that because everyone thinks that it’s really very dirty, I’m not sure if people will go of their own accord, at least at first.”

487,Georgia Medicaid insurer denied psychotherapy for thousands,"ATLANTA (AP) — A newspaper finds that the insurance company that manages medical care for many Georgia children has denied or partially denied more than 6,500 requests for psychotherapy between 2019 and mid-2022.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that many of the requests denied by Amerigroup, a unit of insurance insurance giant Elevance Health, were for children in state-run foster care.

Child advocates tell the newspaper that the Department of Community Health, which is supposed to oversee the contract, isn’t holding Amerigroup accountable.

“The state is not doing its duty,” said Joe Sarra of the Georgia Advocacy Office, a federally mandated organization that works for people with disabilities.

In a January report to state lawmakers, the department said fewer than 100 psychotherapy requests were denied in calendar year 2019 and the 2021 and 2022 budget years by the state’s Medicaid managed care contractors, including Amerigroup.

But the newspaper found through documents obtained in open records requests that Amerigroup denied hundreds of authorization requests for psychiatric residential treatment, something the Department of Community Health didn’t include in its report to lawmakers. Amerigroup also denied thousands of requests for evaluations related to mental or behavioral health issues and hundreds of requests for autism-related services.

Melvin Lindsey, who leads Amerigroup in Georgia, has denied wrongdoing, telling lawmakers in a January hearing that children’s needs come before profits.

“I’ve never made a decision about how to treat anyone, particularly a foster care kid, that was related to cost and I never will,” Lindsey said. “We will get people the right services at the right time, all the time.”

But Human Services Commissioner Candice Broce, who also leads her department’s Division of Family & Children Services — the state’s foster care agency — has been sharply critical. She urged changes as the Department of Community Health seeks new bids on the Medicaid managed care contract that covers foster children. Broce wrote in a 2022 letter that children must wait weeks or months for an appointment, are rejected for services based on a narrow definition of “medical necessity” and are deprived of care coordination for their complex needs.

“To our knowledge, DCH has never levied financial penalties against Amerigroup for non-compliance with any of their contractual provisions,” Broce wrote.

In February, Department of Community Health spokesperson Fiona Roberts said that the contract bidding process precludes the department from commenting on denials and access to care. She said the department would prioritize behavioral health in new contracts.

Roberts said that its report didn’t match the Journal-Constitution’s reporting on denials because the newspaper looked at different categories and time-frames. She said the department has never fined Amerigroup for noncompliance, instead working with Amerigroup to resolve problems.

Email correspondence and denial letters from Amerigroup obtained by the Journal-Constitution show Amerigroup repeatedly denied services by citing a lack of records the insurer wanted to prove medical necessity. Children who were aggressive, hurting themselves or exhibiting other serious issues were frequently blocked from entering or staying longer at psychiatric residential treatment facilities. The insurer often rejected such expensive stays with the same language citing a lack of medical necessity, frequently saying, “Records no longer show you have these issues.”

Among children denied entrance to residential treatment: an 11-year-old girl who smeared feces in the bathroom of a foster care home and attempted to jump out of a window hours after being released from a psychiatric unit. Amerigroup approved a residential stay months later after the girl tried to both drown and electrocute herself, according to the state’s foster care agency. At that point, no facility would accept her.

Amerigroup also denied a medical provider’s request for a residential treatment of a 13-year-old foster child who was trying to hurt herself and was aggressive toward others. While the state appealed the company’s decision, she tried to overdose on lithium pills and cut herself with glass.

The division has created a team of lawyers to appeal coverage denials, and Broce said in January that the division has never lost an appeal. In the meantime, Broce said the division advanced $57 million last year to cover treatment Amerigroup denied.

“This is a problem that far exceeds foster care,” said Melissa Carter, executive director of the Barton Child Law and Policy Center at Emory University. “The fact of the matter is, many of those children who are currently in foster care may not need to be if parents were able to access services to meet their children’s needs in the community.”",0
488,Residents flee as cyclone approaches northwest Australia,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — Miners, cattle ranchers, tourists and Indigenous locals were evacuating from Australia’s remote northwest coast on Wednesday as an intensifying tropical cyclone approached.

Cyclone Ilsa is expected to peak as a Category 4 storm as it crosses the sparsely populated Pilbara coast of Western Australia state somewhere between the iron ore export town of Port Hedland in the west and the tourist town of Broome in the east late Thursday or early Friday, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said.

“Any areas ... where that system does cross the coast are going to experience some very destructive winds, winds in excess of 200 kph (124 mph). They’re going to cause a lot of damage,” bureau manager Todd Smith told reporters.

Abnormally high tides, large waves and flooding were possible, and people should avoid coastal and low-lying areas, Smith warned.

Australia’s meteorology bureau describes cyclones as storms with wind gusts exceeding 90 kph (56 mph) around their center and ranks them on a scale of 1 to 5, with Category 5 the most destructive.

A Category 4 cyclone has a maximum mean wind speed of 160 kph to 199 kph (99 mph to 124 mph) with wind gusts of 225 kph to 279 kph (140 mph to 173 mph). A Category 4 typically causes significant roofing loss, structural damage, dangerous airborne debris and widespread power failure.

A Category 5 cyclone has a maximum mean wind speed exceeding 200 kph (124 mph) with gusts exceeding 280 kph (174 mph). They typically cause widespread destruction.

Ilsa could be the most powerful cyclone to cross the Pilbara coast since Cyclone Christine, a Category 4 storm that struck land halfway between Port Hedland and the town of Karratha to the west in December 2013. Christine brought strong winds and heavy rain, destroying roofs and cutting power. Wind gusts of 172 kph (107 mph) were recorded at Roebourne Airport near Karratha.

Category 5 Cyclone Veronica in March 2019 did not cross the Pilbara coast, but damaged infrastructure and disrupted the region’s mining and offshore gas industry.

On Wednesday morning, Ilsa was a Category 2 cyclone moving south over the Indian Ocean from a position 350 km (217 miles) northwest of Broome, the bureau said.

Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said remote Indigenous communities, cattle ranches, mines and tourism operators in the cyclone’s path had been contacted.

Workers at the 200,000-hectare (500,000-acre) Wallal Downs Station cattle ranch, Newcrest’s Telfer gold and copper mine and trailer parks were being evacuated, along with non-critical workers at BHP’s iron ore mining, rail and port operations across the region, Klemm said.

People living in structures that were not built to withstand a Category 4 storm had been told to leave the area, he said.

“It’s been 10 years since we’ve had a Category 4 cyclone impact the coast of W. A. and so many people up in the Pilbara and the Kimberley wouldn’t have experienced that sort of impact,” Klemm told reporters, referring to the adjoining Pilbara and Kimberley coastal regions.

Extra emergency workers, essential supplies and aircraft have also been sent to the region, he said.

The North West Coastal Highway, which runs 600 km (373 miles) between Port Hedland and Broome, would likely close in the coming days due to flooding, Klemm said.

The Port Hedland port facilities were being cleared of shipping, including iron ore carriers, on Wednesday, he added.

“People need to make sure they’re well prepared for winds in excess of 200 kph (124 mph), which is going to be significant,” Klemm said.",0
489,Utah avalanche leads to shelter-in-place order at ski resort,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — After an hourslong search, a Utah ski resort confirmed that nobody was hurt or killed from an avalanche that gushed from the backcountry into its boundaries on Thursday.

Snowbird, a mountain resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon southeast of Salt Lake City, said on Thursday afternoon that it had completed a search of a part of an area caught in the path of an avalanche that began on Mount Superior and crossed the highway onto a beginner run near the resort’s base.

“No guests or employees were caught in the debris caused by an avalanche,” the resort said in a statement.

Earlier on Thursday, Snowbird said that it had dispatched patrollers and was using rescue dogs, radar technology, and probes to scan the area and ensure nobody was caught under the snow.

The avalanche flooded onto Chickadee, a run under one of several chairlifts that had reopened after the entire mountain closed a day prior because of torrential snowfall.

The avalanche was naturally occurring and not a result of explosives or other mitigation techniques regularly used in the mountain passes, the statement said.

Utah has been blanketed by snow this week. Snowbird reported on Wednesday that an early week storm had dumped more than 5 feet (1.7 meters) on the resort.

The resort ordered guests to shelter in place Thursday afternoon.",0
490,Wildfire threat grows as Florida drought gets steadily worse,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The threat of wildfires is growing in Florida over the coming weeks as more than half the state is experiencing severe to extreme drought conditions likely to persist until rainy season resumes around mid-May, state and federal officials said Thursday.

The National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center reported Thursday that 55% of Florida is in the severe to extreme drought category, with most of the rest of the state listed as “abnormally dry.” The driest conditions are in southwest Florida, the same region hammered by Hurricane Ian in September.

“When you look at a drought map of the state of Florida, you have very dry conditions all across the state,” said Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, whose agency includes the Florida Forest Service. “We’ve had numerous fires already.”

Indeed, since Jan. 1 more than 1,000 wildfires in Florida have burned over 33,000 acres (13,300 hectares), according to state statistics. No evacuations, injuries or major damage to structures have been reported from the fires so far, but that could quickly change as April temperatures heat up without the frequent rainstorms that occur in summer.

Rainfall totals so far this year are well below normal in most of Florida, agriculture department figures show. And as climate change overall raises temperatures around the world, in Florida for February alone 82% of counties were hotter than the typical levels in the 20th Century — affecting an estimated 19.5 million people.

Last year, more than 1,100 people were evacuated during huge wildfires in the Florida Panhandle, much of it the result of dead timber and forest debris left over from Hurricane Michael’s path of destruction in 2018. Officials estimated then that Michael, a Category 5 cyclone, left behind 72 million tons of fallen trees in the area around Panama City.

Two years before that, another 1,000 homes were evacuated and some destroyed by another series of fires in another part of the Panhandle.

Officials fear the southwest part of the state where Hurricane Ian’s 150 mph (241 kph) winds downed thousands of trees could also become a tinderbox. It’s also the only area in Florida in the “extreme” drought category, according to the weather service.

“The further south you go, the drier it is,” said Rick Dolan, chief of the state Forest Service. “Wildfire activity in the state is expected to increase.”

Although lightning strikes often cause wildfires, Simpson said arson and people losing control of backyard or farm fires are a bigger danger. The state Forest Service has about 1,200 employees, half of whom are certified to fight wildfires.

“Most people who start these fires, they’re unintentional,” he said. “This time of the year is when we’re more concerned.”",0
491,No more room for vroom? Paris votes on banishing e-scooters,"PARIS (AP) — The wheels may be about to come off Paris’ ubiquitous for-hire electric scooters.

Zipping around the City of Light on one of them, wind in the hair, or romantically but naughtily e-scooting à deux on one machine when the gendarmes aren’t looking could soon be over if Parisians vote Sunday to do away with the 15,000 opinion-dividing micro-vehicles.

The question City Hall is asking in a citywide mini-referendum is: “For or against self-service scooters in Paris?”

The answer could doom a leading market for the swift two-wheelers that have expanded locomotion choices in the French capital and other urban centers and towns around the world.

Scattered around Paris, easy to locate and hire with a downloadable app and relatively cheap, the scooters are a hit with tourists who love their speed and the help-yourself freedom they offer. In the five years since their introduction, following in the wake of shared cars and shared bicycles, for-hire scooters have also built a following among Parisians who don’t want or can’t afford their own but like the option to escape the Metro and other public transport.

But amid complaints that e-scooters are an eyesore and a traffic menace, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and some of her deputies want to banish the “free floating” flotilla — so called because scooters are picked up and dropped off at their renters’ whim — on safety, public nuisance and cost-benefit grounds before the capital hosts the Olympic Games next year.

Paris’ deputy mayor for transport, David Belliard, says the scooters have been involved in hundreds of accidents. He also says they are more environmentally damaging than walking or riding a bike or bus, and too speedy and anarchic in a crowded, compact and historic city where space is at a premium.

They create “a feeling of overall insecurity in the public space, notably for the most vulnerable people, I’m thinking of seniors or people with disabilities,” he said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press. “There are a few benefits but what I see today is that the costs are greater.”

Paris’ contracts with the three rental companies — Dott, Lime and TIER — expire at the end of August. Whether for-hire e-scooters survive in Paris beyond that will depend on Sunday’s poll that’s open to all of the city’s registered voters, including those from other European Union countries.

“Whatever the result, we will respect it,” Belliard pledged. Hidalgo has promised likewise and said that she, too, hopes Parisians will vote against the scooters.

Scooter critics say the machines are particularly dangerous in the hands of tourists who don’t know how to navigate Paris’ frenetic, honk-honk, get-out-of-my-way traffic and the many users who flout the rules and risk fines by riding two to a scooter and by mounting sidewalks, sometimes barreling through pedestrians.

“I regularly, in fact pretty much all the time, see tourists riding them in pairs, people who often are oblivious to what they are doing, who aren’t in control of the scooter,” says Raphael Sicat, an IT manager who commutes on an electric monocycle to his Paris office. He says he often sees crashes involving for-hire scooters on his 40-kilometer (25-mile) round trip.

“It’s fast and it’s easy and it’s cool,” she said as she and two friends took scooters for a whirl from the foot of the Eiffel Tower.

The three scooter operators say they transported nearly 2 million people in the city last year and that 71% of Parisian users are under 35. They’ve used social media influencers, some of them paid, and messages on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok in a get-out-the-vote drive targeting that age group. They are also offering a free round-trip ride Sunday on their scooters or electric bikes to users who enter the words “Je vote” — I vote in French — into their apps.

Garance Lefèvre, a director of public policy for one of the operators, Lime, says women and LGBTQ+ people value the scooters as a safe mode of late-night travel and that the two-wheelers have generally become ingrained in Parisian habits. The city has “really raised the standards for the entire industry,” she said, and operators have created “durable and responsible jobs.”

“Paris has been the pioneer in terms of welcoming shared micro-mobility,” she says. “Paris would really be an outlier if it decided to put an end to the service.”",0
492,"Severe storms including hail, tornadoes hit Midwest, South","DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — People still sorting through the wreckage of their homes after a weekend of deadly weather braced for another wave of strong storms that began rolling into parts of the Midwest and South on Tuesday evening. At least one tornado was confirmed Tuesday night, and officials warned residents to have shelter ready before going to sleep.

“This could be a night to just set up down in the basement to be safe,” said Tom Philip, a meteorologist in Davenport, Iowa.

The National Weather Service began issuing tornado warnings Tuesday evening in Iowa and Illinois and said a confirmed twister was spotted southwest of Chicago near Bryant, Illinois. No damage was immediately reported.

The storms were expected to hammer some areas hit by severe weather and possibly dozens of tornadoes just days ago that killed at least 32 people, meaning more misery for those whose homes were destroyed in Arkansas, Iowa and Illinois. Dangerous conditions were predicted into the overnight hours Tuesday in parts of Missouri, southwestern Oklahoma and northeastern Texas. Farther south and west, fire danger remained high.

When a tornado hit Little Rock, Arkansas, last Friday, Kimberly Shaw peeked outside to film the storm, then suffered a painful foot injury that required stitches when a glass door behind her shattered and wind nearly sucked her away. With another storm coming, Shaw said she intends to be far more cautious this time and will rush to an underground shelter at her home.

“The original plan was just, ‘If we see a tornado coming, we’ll get in the shelter,’” Shaw said. “But now it’s like you’re not going to see it coming. You’re not going to hear it coming. You just need to get (inside the shelter) as soon as the warning goes out or if you just feel unsafe.”

Shaw added: “And there will be no videotaping.”

Earlier Tuesday, strong thunderstorms swept through the Quad Cities area of Iowa and Illinois with winds up to 90 mph (145 kph) and baseball-size hail. No injuries were reported, but trees were downed and some businesses were damaged in Moline, Illinois.

The weather service and Illinois Emergency Management said a tornado touched down Tuesday morning in the western Illinois community of Colona. Local news reports showed wind damage to some businesses.

Northern Illinois, from Moline to Chicago, saw 75-80 mph (120-128 kph) winds and hail 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) in diameter Tuesday afternoon, National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Baker said. The agency received reports of semitrucks tipped over by winds in Lee County, about 95 miles (153 km) west of Chicago.

Tuesday’s storms targeted northern Illinois, eastern Iowa and southwest Wisconsin. Areas of southern Missouri and Arkansas were most at risk overnight.

In Keokuk County, Iowa, where 19 homes were destroyed and more were damaged Friday, emergency management official Marissa Reisen worried how those cleaning up the damage will cope if another storm hits.

“All of the people who have been impacted by the storms Friday night are doing all this work, to clean up, to gather their stuff, to pile up the debris,” Reisen said. “If a storm comes through and hits them again and throws all that hard work all over the place again, it will be so deflating to those people.”

Severe storms could produce strong tornadoes and large hail Wednesday across eastern Illinois and lower Michigan and in the Ohio Valley, including Indiana and Ohio, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The weather threat extends southwestward across parts of Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas.

The fierce storms that started Friday and continued into the weekend spawned deadly tornadoes in 11 states as the system plodded through Arkansas and into the South, Midwest and Northeast.

The same conditions that fueled those storms — an area of low pressure combined with strong southerly winds — were setting up the severe weather Tuesday into early Wednesday, said Ryan Bunker, a meteorologist with the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma.

Those conditions, which typically include dry air from the West going up over the Rockies and crashing into warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, are what make the U. S. so prone to tornadoes and other severe storms.

Dramatic temperature changes were expected, with Tuesday highs of 74 F (23 C) in Des Moines and 86 F (30 C) in Kansas City plunging overnight to 40 F (4 C) or colder overnight. In Little Rock, Arkansas, Tuesday’s high of 89 F (32 C) tied the record for the date set in 1880.

A blizzard warning was in effect for nearly all of North Dakota and most of South Dakota through at least Wednesday night. The National Weather Service predicted parts of South Dakota could see up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) of snow and wind gusts as high as 55 mph (90 kph).

Dozens of schools in South Dakota closed Tuesday due to blizzard conditions. State executive branch offices were also closed in much of the state.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed off on $20 million Tuesday for emergency snow removal grants to localities. Officials reminded residents to check on neighbors and keep their homes stocked with food, water and medicine, have battery-powered radios in case of power outages and ensure gas meters and furnace vents are clear of snow.

Fire danger persisted across portions of far western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, northeastern New Mexico and far southeastern Colorado, with low humidity, dry vegetation and high wind gusts. Officials issued a fire warning for Custer County in western Oklahoma and urged some residents near the town of Weatherford to evacuate their homes because of a wildfire.

493,"When planting a meadow, heed conditions in your garden, yard","Wildflower meadows have been growing in popularity among gardeners, and for good reason. They’re low-maintenance and drought-tolerant, provide food for birds, wildlife, pollinators and other insects, and they’re pretty.

Wildflowers are native plants, so your options will vary according to where you live. Start your search on the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center’s website (www.wildflower.org). Select your state, and narrow the search to other parameters like plant habit and sun exposure. Then browse the list for plants that strike your fancy.

A typical meadow comprises roughly 60% native grasses and 40% flowering perennials, but there’s no harm in straying from that ratio.

If you’d rather buy ready-made wildflower seed mixes formulated for your region, ensure that the species included are appropriate for the type of soil, sunlight and moisture conditions your garden provides.

Don’t be fooled into believing you can just sprinkle the seeds and walk away. Soil prep is an essential first step for any garden, wild or not. Skip it, and your results will likely disappoint.

First, remove weeds and turfgrasses from the area. Digging them up would be the most labor-intensive way of doing this, and risks moving weed seeds to the surface, making the problem worse. An easier, often more effective strategy is to smother or solarize the existing vegetation, which requires patience.

Layer cardboard over the lawn or weedy area, then cover it with 4-6 inches of mulch. The grass and most of the weeds beneath it will suffocate by fall. Alternatively, cover the area with plastic sheeting or a tarp, and secure it with a stone or brick placed on each corner. This method can be quicker because as the plastic heats up, it essentially cooks the plants beneath it.

In autumn (or next spring), turn the soil in the new bed and incorporate a modest amount of compost. If you have heavy clay soil, mix in sand to improve drainage. Don’t add fertilizer (or use too much compost) because wildflowers prefer low soil fertility.

Annual wildflower plants should be planted only in spring, to allow time for them to mature, produce and drop seeds, which will sprout the following year. Perennial plants, however, can be planted — and perennial and annual seeds sown — in fall.

Most wildflower seeds are tiny, so combining one part of your seed mix with 10 parts of dry sand can make spreading them easier. Scattering by hand may be fine for small beds, but using a seed spreader is preferable in larger areas.

To ensure the seeds make good contact with the soil, walk over them or pass over the area with a lawn roller, but don’t bury them.

If you’re sowing in spring, keep the area lightly watered in the absence of rainfall, as the season’s warming temperatures will threaten to dry them out.

Expect annual species to flower the first year, but you may have to wait a year or two for perennials to bloom. In the meantime, keep the bed free of tall weeds, which could shade out your fledgling wildflowers.

At the end of the growing season, leave your meadow standing to provide food and shelter for overwintering insects and wildlife. Mow it down in spring just before new growth begins.

494,Towering Monument Valley buttes display sunset spectacle,"MONUMENT VALLEY, Utah (AP) — A sunset spectacle featuring two mitten-shaped rock formations played out this week at Monument Valley on the Navajo Nation along the Arizona and Utah border.

Twice a year, in late March and mid-September, spectators, photographers and videographers get a visual treat. As the sun sinks, the West Mitten Butte’s shadow crawls across the desert valley floor before climbing up the side of the East Mitten Butte.

The spectacle draws people from around the world to Monument Valley Tribal Park, which already is popular with tourists.

TV and movie critic Keith Phipps once described Monument Valley as having “defined what decades of moviegoers think of when they imagine the American West.”

It is a frequent filming location, including a number of Westerns by the late American film director John Ford, as well as the 1994 Oscar-winning film “Forest Gump.” In the movie, the character played by Tom Hanks is seen running on the road to Monument Valley, the park’s impressive landscape in the background.",0
495,Firm restarting oil pipeline involved in California spill,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — An offshore pipeline involved in a 2021 oil spill that fouled Southern California beaches is being put back in service, the operator said.

Amplify Energy Corp. said Monday that it received approval from federal regulatory agencies to restart operations and last weekend began the process of filling the pipeline, which is expected to take about two weeks.

“Following the line fill process, the pipeline will be operated in accordance with the restart procedures that were reviewed and approved by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,” the Houston-based company said in a press release.

The pipeline carries oil to shore from platforms in San Pedro Bay, near the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors.

Amplify Energy recently announced a settlement with companies associated with two ships it accused of dragging anchors and striking the pipeline during a January 2021 storm, leading to the spill of 25,000 gallons (94,600 liters) of crude oil months later.

“The approval from federal regulatory agencies and the receipt of $85 million in net proceeds from the vessels that struck and damaged our pipeline substantially concludes a very challenging last 18 months for the Company,” Amplify said.

While less severe than initially feared, the oil spill created a miles-wide sheen in the ocean and sent blobs of crude ashore, primarily impacting the cities of Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. It further shuttered beaches for a week and fisheries for more than a month, oiled birds and threatened area wetlands.

Southern California fishermen, tourism companies and property owners sued Amplify and the shipping vessels seeking compensation for their losses. Amplify agreed to pay $50 million and the vessel companies agreed to pay $45 million to settle those lawsuits.

Amplify also reached a plea deal with federal authorities for negligently discharging crude.",0
496,When exactly will India surpass China as most populous?,"India will surpass China’s population this month. Or maybe in July. Or, perhaps it’s happened already?

Demographers are unsure exactly when India will take the title as the most populous nation in the world because they’re relying on estimates to make their best guess. But they know it’s going to happen soon, if it hasn’t occurred by now.

China has had the most people in the world since at least 1950, the year United Nations population data began. Both China and India have more than 1.4 billion people, and combined they make up more than a third of the world’s 8 billion people.

“Actually, there is no way we can know exactly when India will surpass China,” said Bruno Schoumaker, a demographer at Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium. “There is some uncertainty, not only about India’s population, but also China’s population.”

Mathematical calculations from a range of surveys, as well as birth and death records, project that India will overtake China sometime in the middle of April. But demographers warn that it should be taken with a grain of salt since the numbers are fuzzy and could be revised.

“It’s a crude approximation, a best guess,” said Patrick Gerland, chief of the population estimates and projections section at the U. N. in New York.

Not long ago, India wasn’t expected to become most populous until later this decade. But the timing has been sped up by a drop in China’s fertility rate, with families having fewer children.

Demographers at the U. N. Population Division make estimates based on projections from a wide variety of data sources to get what they believe are the most up-to-date demographic numbers. The last update to the data used for these calculations for both India and China was July 2022, said Sara Hertog, a U.N. population affairs officer in New York.

The demographers then use a statistical technique to infer when India’s population has surpassed that of China, according to Stuart Gietel-Basten, a professor at Khalifa University of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi.

“The reality, of course, is that these estimates are just that,” Gietel-Basten said. “But at least they are based on a relatively solid and consistent methodology.”

The foundations of both nations’ numbers are censuses, or head counts, conducted every decade.

China’s last census was in 2020. Demographers used birth and death records, along with other administrative data, to calculate how the population has grown since then.

India’s last census was in 2011. Its scheduled 2021 census was postponed by COVID-19. Without an actual door-to-door count for more than a decade, sample surveys have filled in the gaps to help demographers and India itself understand its population, said Alok Vajpeyi of the New Delhi-based non-government organization, Population Foundation of India.

Among the most important is the Sample Registration System, India’s large-scale demographic survey that gathers data on such things as births, deaths, fertility and more.

Andrea Wojnar, the United Nations Population Fund’s representative for India, said the agency is confident in the survey’s numbers “because it uses a very robust methodology.”

China has an aging population with stagnant growth even after the government seven years ago retreated from a one-child policy, and just two years ago said couples could have three children.

India has a much younger population, a higher fertility rate and a decrease in infant mortality over the last three decades.

India has more babies born each year than in any other country, while China has joined many European countries in having more deaths each year than births, said Dudley Poston, Jr., an emeritus professor of sociology at Texas A&M University.

There’s more than bragging rights at stake over which nation is the world’s most populous — there are social and economic consequences. In India, that means a growing labor force and growth that sparks economic activity. In China, that means fewer working-age adults able to support an aging population.

Once a country hits a low fertility level, it’s often hard to recover population growth, even with changes in government policy to encourage more births, said Toshiko Kaneda, technical director of demographic research at the Population Reference Bureau in Washington.

“Psychologically, it will be tough for China, especially given the rivalry in other areas between the two countries,” Gietel-Basten said. “It is a big moment in human history as the baton is passed to India.”",0
497,"India residents try to save a river, officials deny problems","KOCHI, India (AP) — Eloor smells like it is dying.

Once it was an island of rich farmland on the Periyar River, 17 km (10.5 miles) from the Arabian sea, teeming with fish. Now, a stench of putrid flesh permeates the air. Most of the fish are gone. Locals say people living near the river are hardly even having children anymore.

Yet here is Shaji, alone in his small fiber boat, fishing with his handmade rod, the southern Indian state of Kerala’s massive industrial smokestacks behind him.

Some 300 chemical companies belch out dense fumes, almost warning people to stay away. The waters have taken on dark hues. Shaji, a fisherman in his late 40s who only uses one name, is among the few who remain.

“Most of the people here are trying to migrate from this place. If we look at the streets, it’s almost empty. There are no jobs and now we cannot even find work on the river,” said Shaji, displaying the few pearl spot fish he managed to catch during an entire day in March.

EDITOR’S NOTE: This article is part of a series produced under the India Climate Journalism Program, a collaboration between The Associated Press, the Stanley Center for Peace and Security and the Press Trust of India.

Many of the petrochemical plants here are more than five decades old. They produce pesticides, rare earth elements, rubber processing chemicals, fertilizers, zinc-chrome products and leather treatments.

Some are government owned, including Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore, established in 1943, Indian Rare Earths Limited, and Hindustan Insecticides Limited.

Residents say the industries take in large amounts of freshwater from the Periyar and discharge concentrated wastewater with almost no treatment.

Anwar C. I., who uses initials for his last name in the custom of southern India, is a member of a Periyar anti-pollution committee and a private contractor who lives in the area. He said residents have grown accustomed to the reek that seems to hang over the area like a heavy curtain, enveloping everything and everyone.

The groundwater is now fully contaminated and the government’s contention that the businesses benefit people is wrong, he said.

“When they claim to provide employment to many people through industrialization, the net impact is that the livelihood of thousands is lost,” Anwar said. People cannot make a living from ruined land and water.

Residents have periodically risen up against the factories in the form of protests. Demonstrations began in 1970, when the village first witnessed thousands of fish dying. Both die-offs and protests happened again many times after that, said Shabeer Mooppan, a long-time resident who has often demonstrated.

“Some of the early protest leaders are now bedridden” in advanced age, Mooppan said, emphasizing just how long people in the community have been trying to get the river cleaned up.

Now Shabeer is trying to improve surveillance, to catch those responsible for fouling the river. It’s a method used by riverkeepers and baykeepers in other cities around the world. He is also pursuing legal cases against polluting industries.

The state Pollution Control Board downplayed the industrial pollution in the Periyar River, blaming it on sewage from homes, commercial institutions and markets upstream.

“We have not found any alarming rate of metals in the river water. All the levels are within the limits,” said Baburajan P K, chief environmental engineer of the board.

Baburajan said only five major companies of the over 300 industrial plants in the region are allowed to discharge wastewater into the river, and it must be treated. The rest must treat their wastewater, reusing or disposing it on their own land. He said hefty environmental levies have been imposed on violators.

Research also tells a story of a river in distress.

As far back as 1998, scientists at the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies found some 25 species of fish had disappeared from the region. Experts have found contamination in vegetables, chicken, eggs, fruits and tuber crops from the region.

Chandramohan Kumar, a professor in Chemical Oceanography at Cochin University of Science and Technology, has researched Periyar River pollution in several studies.

“We have observed pollution from various organic fertilizers, metallic components. Toxic metals like cadmium, copper, zinc and all the heavy metals can be detected there,” Kumar said.

India also has a special environmental court called the National Green Tribunal. A decade ago, it ordered the government to create an action plan to restore water quality in the river to protect the environment and public health. It also ordered the formation of a monitoring committee.

More recently, the Tribunal was worried enough to initiate its own proceeding on the pollution. It cited studies going back to 2005, carried out by the environmental non-profit group Thanal, that showed “hundreds of people living near Kuzhikandam Creek at Eloor were afflicted with various diseases such as cancer, congenital birth defects, bronchitis, asthma, allergic dermatitis, nervous disorders and behavior changes.”

The court cited another survey of 327 families in the region that showed hazardous chemicals, including DDT, hexachlorochyclohexane, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, toluene, manganese and nickel had been discharged into into Kuzhikandam Creek “and adversely affected the health condition of people in Eloor.”

Kumar said the remedy for this pollution is onsite treatment at each facility, and it comes down to money. “If they are ready to invest, the effluent discharge can be resolved,” he said.

The Pollution Control Board responded that it recently began a study that could lead to curbing air pollution and reducing the intolerable stench in the area largely caused, it said, by bone meal fertilizer factories and meat rendering plants. It is expected to be finalized in May.

The board dismissed allegations that it does not actively pursue polluters and said it ensures no untreated waste liquids are discharged into the river.

Trainees with the Pollution Control Board do daily trips to collect samples from six different points along the river.

“But we don’t know what happens to those samples,” said resident Adam Kutty. “What’s the point of having all the money in the world and no water to drink?”

Omana Manikuttan, a long-time resident of Eloor, said for years she and her neighbors have not eaten fish from the river. Eating them leads to serious diarrhea and tastes like pesticides, even after cooking, Manikuttan said.

As the blame game continues, the grass and trees in the area appear wilted as if scorched by the noxious fumes. The birds seem to have been driven away by the air. Without official action, the pall over the region and its residents is unlikely to lift soon.",0
498,Dutch court nixes plan to reduce flights at Schiphol Airport,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A judge ruled Wednesday that the Dutch government cannot order Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, one of Europe’s busiest aviation hubs, to reduce the number of flights from 500,000 per year to 460,000, dealing a blow to efforts to cut emissions and noise pollution.

The ruling came in a summary case brought by airlines and civil aviation organizations led by Dutch carrier KLM that sought to halt the planned cuts unveiled last year.

The decision by a judge in Haarlem, a city close to Schiphol, came a day after the airport announced plans to phase out all flights between midnight and 5 a.m., ban private jets and the noisiest planes, and abandon a project for an additional runway.

The judge ruled that the Dutch government did not follow the correct procedure when it called on Schiphol to reduce flight numbers, a decision that was hailed last year as a breakthrough by environmental groups.

Wednesday’s decision means that Schiphol “may not reduce the maximum number of flights ... to 460,000,” the court in Haarlem said in a statement.

In response, KLM said it plans measures that offer “a better alternative for achieving less noise and CO2 while meeting travelers’ need to fly.”

The airline said it would explain its approach in the next phase of the case. “This will investigate whether noise levels can be reduced around Schiphol using methods other than those envisaged by the ministry,” KLM said.

The government ministry responsible for aviation infrastructure said it was studying the ruling and considering its next steps.

The ministry said in a written reaction that it is “striving to find a new balance between the interests of residents and the living environment on the one hand and the economic importance of Schiphol for the Netherlands on the other.”

U. S. carrier Delta Air Lines welcomed the ruling, saying it safeguarded Schiphol’s future.

“Delta believes that it is possible to balance sustainability priorities with passengers’ desire to travel and connect with people across the world — something we have demonstrated through a vigorous commitment to fleet renewal and other practices to help decarbonize our operations and reduce noise,” Peter Carter, Delta’s executive vice president for external affairs, said.

International Air Transport Association Director General Willie Walsh said the judge “understood that the Dutch government violated its obligations in short-cutting processes that would bring scrutiny to its desire to cut flight numbers at Schiphol.”

“Major polluter KLM is giving a slap in the face to local residents, the climate and the government that saved the company from bankruptcy,” groups including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth said. “This ruling may cause a delay, but Schiphol will shrink. We are convinced of that. The government has now also started the correct procedures for this.”",0
499,Easter marks Las Vegas' warmest day yet in 2023,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Easter Sunday marks the first day in 2023 that Las Vegas temperatures cracked 80 F (27 C) as spring weather finally comes into the forecast on the heels of a long, wet winter.

It is the latest in the year that the city first reached 80 since 1982, according to the National Weather Service’s Las Vegas office.

Las Vegas just missed the 80 F mark on Saturday when it reached 79 F (26 C), according to the weather service. The last time Sin City cracked 80 F was on Oct. 22 — 169 days ago. That is the fourth longest streak below 80 on record.

Additionally, there is just less than a 50% chance of Las Vegas reaching 90 F (32 C) on Monday. If that happens, it will be just the third time the city’s first 80- and 90-degree days occur consecutively — following 1991 and 2002, per the weather service.

Seven hours north in Reno, Sunday was sunny with a high in the mid-70s.

Unusually cold weather has maintained a grip on Nevada statewide since December, including Las Vegas, which recorded its coldest March since 1991 with an average temperature of 54.4 degrees (12.5 C), which is nearly 6 degrees (3 C) below normal, the weather service said.

500,Albania hosts forum promoting regional tourism,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) — An international forum bringing together officials from the Western Balkans and southern Europe to Albania’s capital aims to promote sustainable regional tourism as a main source of revenue, officials said Tuesday.

Tirana is hosting three days of the “Future of Environmental and Sustainable Tourism in Albania” forum, supported by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO ).

UNWTO official Zurab Pololikashvili urged the Balkan countries to join together an form a single tourism destination in order to more effectively compete with large markets such as China, the United States or the Gulf countries.

“We are not rivals. We are complimentary to each other,” said Albanian Tourism Minister Mirela Kumbaro.

With 450 kilometers (280 miles) of coastline and 300 days of sunshine per year Albania offers a diverse range of attractions ranging from beaches to mountain resorts, as well as great food and culture. .

“What’s new beyond the sea and the beaches is nature, the protected areas, the adventurous, mountainous, natural tourism and agro-tourism,” said Kumbaro, adding that the aim is to attract tourists year-round.

Tourism and agriculture are two main revenue resources for post-communist Albania, one of Europe’s poorest countries. Tourism generated 17% of GDP in 2021, with arrivals increasing 33% last year to 7.5 million people. Kumbaro said 59% more tourists have come in the first quarter this year compared to last year.

Albanian officials say environmental protection goes hand-in-hand with tourism promotion. Last month, Tirana declared the Vjosa River - the last wild river in Europe - a national park meaning that any development is prohibited. More than a fifth of the country is protected.

Mohamed Ali Alabbar of the Eagle Hills Group of Companies, an Abu Dhabi-based private real estate investment and development company, is to invest $2.5 billion to build the Durres Yachts & Marina port and residence area.

Like many others, Albania’s tourism industry is grappling with a worker shortage as many young Albanians have emigrated to western European countries in search of a better life.

Dorin Sema, a chief waiter at Lalezi Bay tourist resort, says it’s not easy to keep young workers when higher salaries beckon abroad.",0

0,Prince Harry to attend King's coronation without Meghan,"Prince Harry is set to attend his grandfather's coronation without his wife Meghan Markle. Reports suggest that the Duke of Sussex will travel alone to Bhutan to attend the ceremony on behalf of the royal family. Meghan will allegedly remain in the US with their children, citing health concerns as the reason for her absence. The decision comes amidst rumors of tension within the royal family, with many speculating that the couple's recent Oprah interview played a role in their absence from the event.",1
1,Tupperware stock plunges after warning it could go out of business,"Tupperware, the company famous for its airtight plastic containers, has issued a warning that it might not be able to carry on as a going concern. The company's stock has predictably plummeted, sending shockwaves through the market.

Despite being a household name for almost 75 years, Tupperware has struggled to keep pace with the changing retail landscape. Its direct-sales model, where ""consultants"" host parties in homes to sell batches of Tupperware, has been losing ground to more modern online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.

In a statement, Tupperware said that if things didn't improve soon, ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting could lead to bankruptcy. It also revealed that it had spent $46 million in legal fees related to an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investors were jolted by the news, and the reaction was swift. Tupperware's share price fell over 30% in a single day of trading. The company's market value, which stood at $2.6 billion before the warning, has since shrunk by over a billion dollars.

Tupperware is far from the only casualty of the changing retail landscape. Traditional retailers like Sears, JC Penney, and Toys R Us have all been forced to declare bankruptcy over the last few years as online shopping sites have hacked away at their customer base.

However, Tupperware's fans, who swear by the product's ability to keep food fresh, have been pushing back, calling for a boycott of online shopping sites that compete with Tupperware's consultants.

""I'm a Tupperware consultant and love the product and everything it stands for,"" one consultant wrote on Facebook. ""We want to see Tupperware remain as a direct-sales company and not be taken over by the online shopping craze.""

Some analysts have also come to the company's defense, pointing out that Tupperware has a solid international presence and a well-established brand name. They suggest that the company needs to refresh its product offering and evolve its sales strategy to stay relevant.

Others are less optimistic, warning that Tupperware's current troubles might be too big to overcome. ""If Tupperware cannot keep up with a traditional model of selling and with its costs and reporting, then it is surely in deep trouble,"" wrote Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Tupperware's corporate leadership, meanwhile, seems determined to fight on. In an email to employees, CEO Tricia Stitzel wrote that despite the company's current challenges, ""we are confident that Tupperware Brands is built for the future.""",1

3,Ukrainian prime minister says Putin bears responsibility for purported beheadings,"Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has called out Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that he bears responsibility for the purported beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. Shmyhal’s comments come in the wake of unconfirmed reports that Russian-backed separatists have captured and executed Ukrainian soldiers in the Donbass region. Shmyhal called on Putin to take responsibility for his actions and stop the violence in the region. The conflict in Donbass has been ongoing since 2014 and has resulted in the deaths of over 13,000 people.",1
4,JPMorgan ends remote work for senior bankers,"In a surprising move, JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States, has declared that it will end remote work for its senior bankers as the pandemic restrictions ease.

The bank, which had initially permitted remote work, has now mandated that senior bankers across its investment and consumer banking divisions must return to work at least half-time at JPMorgan's offices. According to reports, this mandate applies to the bank’s top executives who report directly to the CEO.

In a memo, JPMorgan's head of banking, Daniel Pinto, stated that the bank is ""committed to easing the work-from-home experience for employees as we pivot to the post-pandemic environment."" He elaborated that face-to-face collaboration is ""critical"" to the bank's success and that ""the ability to solve important problems together is why we work as a team.” However, the memo did not specify when the senior bankers would be expected to return to the office and under what conditions.

JPMorgan's announcement comes after Wall Street employees throng back to the office, with other banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley calling back their employees to the physical workplace. The trend is being driven by some executives who believe that collaboration and mentorship within investment banking environments cannot happen virtually.

However, the move has met with criticism, with advocates of remote work pointing out that research shows that remote workers are often more productive than office-bound workers. Besides, the pandemic has demonstrated that remote work is possible without affecting the office's effectiveness.

JPMorgan may be onto something new in terms of its remote work mandate, and we have yet to see how it will affect the bank's business operations. However, the decision to revoke the bank's remote work policy could someday see a return if productivity takes a significant hit. Until then, senior bankers of JPMorgan Chase will be back to the hustle and bustle of Wall Street.",1
5,TikTok banned from school-owned devices at all Florida state universities,"In a move to protect sensitive information from foreign surveillance, Florida has now banned TikTok from being used on all school-owned devices in state universities.

The popular Chinese-owned social media app has been at the center of numerous security concerns for several months now, and this has prompted some US institutions to take action against it. While the ban is only restricted to devices owned by schools, it has raised security alarms regarding the app, which has been downloaded over 2 billion times worldwide.

This announcement follows a similar directive at the federal level where the Trump administration has been working to remove TikTok from US app stores over concerns that the Chinese government was surveilling Americans through the platform.

While TikTok has consistently denied these allegations, some experts believe that these questions about their practices are warranted.

Surveillance risks aside, TikTok also presents a broad cybersecurity risk to any organization that wants to implement a ban. Like most social media networks, TikTok collects user data and sends them back to its servers for storage. Experts warn that the app's data policies could prove harmful to universities and educational institutions that might be inadvertently exposing sensitive data to risk.

The ban at Florida universities is sure to raise further questions about the data privacy policies of TikTok in the US. Authorities suggest that TikTok poses a risk not just to individual users but to governments and businesses as well.

However, while some Americans are satisfied with the TikTok ban, several people feel it is another example of the US government's attempts to control the internet.

The truth is that the TikTok ban in Florida schools is less about censorship and more about data security. With so many potential security risks associated with TikTok, universities have taken the step to protect their networks and devices alike. It remains to be seen whether other states will follow suit.

In conclusion, while TikTok has gained immense popularity among young people worldwide, no one can deny the security concerns plaguing the app. The ban at Florida state universities raises further questions about what the future holds for TikTok and its presence in the United States.",1
6,This investor can spot market bubbles. Now he's warning of an 'ominous' bust,"Investor Jeremy Grantham has proven in the past that he knows how to spot market bubbles before they burst. His warnings before the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis were eerily accurate.

Now, Grantham is sounding the alarm once again. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, he said he sees an ""ominous"" bubble forming in the markets and he's urging investors to exercise caution.

Grantham, the co-founder of investment management firm GMO, has a track record of accurately predicting market bubbles. He famously warned about the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, and again about the housing bubble that led to the financial crisis of 2008.

In the Bloomberg interview, Grantham said he's seeing ""a lot of signs of an epic bubble in the stock market."" He pointed to high valuations and speculative behavior, particularly in technology and green energy stocks.

Grantham isn't alone in his warnings. Many experts have been sounding the alarm about a potential market bubble for months. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented volatility in the markets, with stocks swinging wildly between record highs and steep losses.

But despite the volatility, the markets have continued to climb higher, fueled in part by low interest rates and unprecedented stimulus measures from governments around the world.

Grantham believes investors are underestimating the risks in the markets, particularly given the current economic and political climate. He pointed to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to wreak havoc on economies and could lead to a prolonged recession.

He also noted the political unrest in the US, including the storming of the Capitol on January 6th. Grantham believes the current political climate poses a threat to stability and could lead to further market turmoil.

Given these risks, Grantham is urging investors to be cautious and to look for value in areas of the market that have been overlooked. He notes that many parts of the market are overvalued, but there are still opportunities for investors who are willing to do their research.

Grantham also stressed the importance of diversification, noting that many investors have become overly concentrated in technology and growth stocks, which are particularly vulnerable in a market downturn.

For investors who are concerned about a potential market bubble, there are several steps they can take to protect their portfolios. One is to look for undervalued stocks or sectors that have been overlooked by the market.

This could include sectors like energy, which have been battered by the pandemic but could rebound in the coming months as the economy recovers. It could also include small-cap stocks, which have been out of favor in recent years but could offer upside potential as the market cycles.

Another strategy is to focus on defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic volatility. These may include consumer staples, healthcare, and utility companies, which tend to perform well even in tough economic times.

Finally, it's important for investors to have a long-term perspective and to avoid making knee-jerk reactions to short-term market movements. While it's impossible to predict the future, history has shown that markets have a tendency to cycle between periods of growth and contraction.

By taking a cautious and diversified approach, investors can help protect themselves from potential market volatility and position themselves for long-term success.

Grantham's warnings may be ominous, but they shouldn't be ignored. Investors who take the time to understand the risks in the market and to take steps to protect their portfolios can weather any storm that comes their way.",1
7,"A labor market cooldown: US economy added just 236,000 jobs in March","The US labor market added just 236,000 jobs in March, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This marks a significant slowdown from the robust job growth seen in February, when the economy added 468,000 jobs.

While the 236,000 jobs added in March is still a solid figure by historical standards, it falls far short of the 1 million jobs some economists had been predicting as the US economy continues to recover from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to 6%, down slightly from 6.2% in February. This suggests that the slow job growth may be due in part to a shrinking labor force, as some workers drop out of the workforce entirely rather than continue to search for jobs.

Many economists had been predicting that the US labor market would show signs of turbocharged growth in the coming months, as businesses began to reopen and consumers started spending more freely. However, the March jobs report suggests that the recovery may not be as rapid as some had hoped.

Some experts point to a number of potential factors that may be dragging down job growth. For one, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is still creating a great deal of uncertainty for business owners and consumers alike, making it difficult for companies to make long-term hiring decisions.

In addition, many businesses are still struggling to find skilled workers to fill open positions, with some industries seeing particularly acute labor shortages. For example, many restaurants and bars are reporting difficulties finding enough workers to fully staff their establishments, even as demand for dining out picks up.

Some analysts also note that the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the country could be dampening consumer confidence and leading some businesses to put off hiring plans.

Despite these headwinds, many economists remain optimistic that the US labor market will continue to recover in the coming months, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than previously anticipated.

""We still expect to see very strong job growth in the second half of the year, as the economy picks up steam and the labor market continues to heal,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""But it's clear that the recovery won't be a straight line, and there will be bumps along the way.""

One potential bright spot in the March jobs report was the continued resurgence of the leisure and hospitality sector, which added 280,000 jobs last month. This suggests that consumer spending on dining out, travel, and other leisure activities may be picking up as the weather warms and more Americans get vaccinated.

However, other industries saw much more tepid job growth in March. The construction sector, for example, added just 11000 jobs, while manufacturing added just 5300 jobs.

There were also some worrying signs in the March jobs report when it comes to wage growth. Average hourly earnings fell by 4 cents last month, dropping to $29.96 per hour. This suggests that there may still be significant slack in the labor market, with employers able to keep wages down despite historically low unemployment rates.

Overall, the March jobs report seems to suggest that the path to a full and robust economic recovery may be longer than some had hoped. However, with millions of Americans still unemployed or underemployed due to the pandemic, policymakers will need to continue working to support workers and businesses alike in the months ahead.

In particular, many economists are calling for additional fiscal stimulus measures to help bridge the gap until the economy is able to fully recover. While the massive stimulus bill passed by Congress earlier this month will certainly help, many experts argue that more is needed to ensure that workers and companies are able to weather the ongoing disruptions caused by the pandemic.

As the US economy continues to navigate the choppy waters of the pandemic recovery, the labor market remains a key indicator of overall economic health. While the March jobs report may be somewhat disappointing to some, it's clear that the US economy still has a long way to go before it fully bounces back from the Covid-19 crisis.",1
8,Arkansas governor signs sweeping bill imposing a minimum age limit for social media usage,"On Tuesday, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson signed a sweeping bill that imposes a minimum age limit for social media usage. The new law prohibits children under the age of 13 from creating accounts on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter without their parents' approval, as well as requiring tech companies to provide parents with detailed reports on how their children are using these platforms.

The law, which will come into effect from January 1, 2022, also requires social media companies to implement measures that prevent minors from being exposed to harmful and inappropriate content. The companies must allow parents to control the settings and limit access to social media, and they must also offer options for removing or deleting any posts or data associated with minors' accounts.

Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, expressed optimism about the impact of the legislation during a press conference. ""This law will protect the safety and privacy of our children, and it will give parents more control over their children's online activities,"" he said. ""We live in a digital world, and while social media can be a great tool for communication, it can also be a source of danger for our children if not used responsibly.""

The legislation has been described as one of the most comprehensive efforts by any state to protect children's online safety. According to a report by the Pew Research Center, about 81% of American teens use social media, while 69% of children aged between 3 and 12 already have their own devices that can access the internet.

The new law has been welcomed by child safety advocates and parents across the state. For years, they have been calling for stricter regulations to prevent children from being exposed to harmful and inappropriate content on social media platforms. Cases of cyberbullying, sexting, and online harassment have become more common in recent years, and experts attribute these incidents to the lack of effective regulations.

In a statement, Donna Rice Hughes, CEO of the non-profit organization Enough Is Enough, praised the new law, stating, ""Arkansas has taken a landmark step to protect children from online predators and from stumbling across inappropriate content. The passage of this bill sends a clear message that children's safety must come first.""

However, some critics of the law have argued that it violates the First Amendment rights of children, especially since social media has become an important means of expression and communication for many young adults. Others argue that it puts an undue burden on social media platforms, which are already facing a range of regulatory challenges.

In response, supporters of the bill have pointed out that it only prohibits children under 13 from creating accounts on social media platforms without their parents' consent. Young adults who are 13 or older can still use social media, but they will be subject to the same regulations as adults. Some experts argue that the new law will even give children more protection and control over their online activities, as well as empowering parents to be more involved in their children's lives.

The Arkansas law is part of a growing trend among states to regulate social media usage among children. In 2018, California passed a similar law, which requires social media companies to obtain parents' permission before collecting any data from children under 13. The Federal Trade Commission has also been actively pursuing social media companies that violate regulations under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

More recently, the Biden administration has indicated that it is planning to review and revise COPPA to better protect children online. The move comes in response to growing concerns about the impact of social media on children's mental health, as well as the rise of cyberbullying and harassment.

In conclusion, the Arkansas law marks a significant step forward in protecting children's safety and privacy online. By requiring social media companies to provide parents with more control and oversight, the law will help prevent children from being exposed to harmful and inappropriate content, as well as giving parents a greater sense of security and peace of mind. While some critics have raised concerns about the impact on children's First Amendment rights, supporters argue that the law strikes a balance between free expression and responsible regulation. As more states and the federal government implement similar regulations, it will be important to closely monitor their impact and effectiveness in promoting child safety and wellbeing online.",1

11,UN tells Afghan staff to stay home after Taliban bans women from working with the organization,"The United Nations has instructed all its Afghan staff to stay at home after the Taliban prohibited women from working with the organization. The move comes as the Taliban continue their takeover of the country following the withdrawal of US troops.

The UN's decision came after the Taliban ordered all women who work for the organization to stay at home. The Taliban's religious police have also been making door-to-door checks to make sure that women are not working outside the home, according to reports.

The UN has called on the Taliban to allow women to continue working with the organization. ""The United Nations is deeply concerned by the reports of the Taliban's new policy banning women from employment with the organization,"" a UN spokesperson said in a statement. ""We call on the Taliban to reverse this decision immediately.""

The UN has a large presence in Afghanistan and employs thousands of staff, many of whom are women. These staff members work on a wide range of issues, including human rights, gender equality, and humanitarian aid.

The Taliban's ban on women working with the UN will have a significant impact on the organization's ability to carry out its work in Afghanistan. It will also have a devastating effect on the women who work for the organization, many of whom have dedicated their lives to serving the Afghan people.

The Taliban's decision to ban women from working with the UN is just the latest in a series of moves that have raised concerns about the group's commitment to human rights. The Taliban have also been accused of targeting women's rights activists and journalists.

The UN has called on the Taliban to respect the human rights of all Afghan citizens, including women. ""We remind the Taliban of their obligations under international humanitarian law and urge them to ensure that all human rights are respected and protected in Afghanistan,"" the UN spokesperson said.

The Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan has been marked by violence and chaos. The group captured Kabul on August 15, following a rapid advance that took many by surprise. Since then, the Taliban have been consolidating their power, and there have been reports of widespread human rights abuses.

The situation in Afghanistan is a humanitarian crisis, and the international community has a responsibility to act. The UN has called for an immediate end to the violence and for the protection of civilians.

The Taliban have said that they will form an inclusive government and respect the rights of all Afghans. However, their actions so far have raised doubts about their commitment to these pledges.

The international community must use all diplomatic and economic tools at its disposal to pressure the Taliban to respect human rights and allow women to continue working with the UN. The lives of millions of Afghan women and girls depend on it.

In conclusion, the UN's decision to instruct its Afghan staff to stay home following the Taliban's ban on women working with the organization is a significant blow to the UN's operations in the country. The Taliban's actions raise serious concerns about their commitment to human rights, and the international community must take action to ensure that women's rights are respected and protected in Afghanistan. The lives and livelihoods of millions of Afghan women and girls depend on it.",1
12,"January 12, 2023 Russia-Ukraine news","January 12, 2023 Russia-Ukraine News

It has been almost a decade since the tensions between Russia and Ukraine started to escalate and the world has been closely watching the developments between these two nations. Since the Crimean annexation in 2014, the world has been keeping a close eye on the political and territorial disputes between Ukraine and Russia. However, 2023 has brought some significant changes in this long-standing conflict.

In recent news, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a long-awaited meeting in Kazakhstan's capital, Nur-Sultan. The meeting was the first time the two leaders had come face-to-face in over two years. The meeting lasted several hours, and both leaders issued a joint statement afterward, signaling a significant breakthrough in the long-standing dispute between the two countries.

According to reports, the meeting focused on finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. The conflict in Ukraine began after protests in Kiev led to the removal of the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, which caused protests in Ukraine's eastern regions. The unrest was fueled by Russian involvement, which soon turned into an armed conflict.

The talks between Putin and Zelensky have raised hopes that a peaceful solution could be reached. The Ukrainian President also acknowledged that the talks were positive and productive. Both leaders have expressed their commitment to achieving peace in the region while also acknowledging their differences.

The joint statement by the two leaders highlighted their commitment to reaching a peaceful resolution, and it outlined several steps that will be taken to achieve this goal. One of the steps outlined is the release and the exchange of all prisoners held by each country. The statement also called for the withdrawal of troops from the conflict region.

While the meeting between the two leaders does signal a significant step forward, experts and analysts caution that there is still a long way to go before peace can be achieved. The agreement will need action, as well as commitment from both sides, to be sustainable. Most importantly, the ceasefire must hold, and both sides must be willing to make concessions and compromises.

The meeting between Putin and Zelensky has been hailed as a positive development by international leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who have been crucial in mediating between the two sides. The European Union, which has imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea, has also welcomed the joint statement and the progress made by the two leaders.

The United States, another country that has been closely monitoring the situation, has also expressed support for the talks between Putin and Zelensky. The US has called on Russia to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and has urged both sides to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.

However, not everyone has welcomed the development. Ukrainian nationalists and right-wing groups have criticized the meeting, accusing Zelensky of giving in to Russian demands. These groups have been a vocal opponent of any negotiations with Russia and have been calling for a more aggressive stance against their neighbor.

The conflict in Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the country, with more than 13,000 people killed and over 30,000 injured since it began. The conflict has also caused deep divisions within the country, torn communities apart, and left many people feeling disillusioned with their leaders.

The meeting between Putin and Zelensky could be a step towards ending the suffering of Ukraine's people, but it is critical that both sides follow through on their commitments. The world will be watching closely, and the pressure will be on both leaders to ensure that they do not disappoint.

In recent years, Russia's relations with the West have been strained by its involvement in the Ukrainian conflict, as well as allegations of interference in the 2016 US Presidential election. However, Putin has recently signaled his willingness to engage in constructive dialogue with the West. At the same time, Ukraine is currently facing economic and political challenges that require international help.

The Ukrainian economy was heavily impacted by the conflict, which led to a drop in foreign investment and caused damage to infrastructure. The country has also been facing political instability, with many Ukrainians feeling disappointed with their government's response to the conflict.

Russia, on the other hand, has been facing international sanctions and increased isolation. The country's economy has also been impacted by low oil prices, which have hit its revenues. Putin has been attempting to diversify the economy and reduce its reliance on oil exports.

The meeting between Putin and Zelensky represents a potential turning point in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. If the two countries can find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, it could have a broader impact on relations between Russia and the West.

The conflict in Ukraine has also had broader implications for global security, as it has highlighted the dangers of the expansionist policies of some nation-states. International leaders have been calling for a rules-based international order, where disputes are resolved through dialogue and negotiation rather than military force.

The United Nations has been playing a crucial role in mediating between Ukraine and Russia since the conflict began. The UN has been calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict and has been calling on both sides to respect the rights of the Ukrainian people.

The meeting between Putin and Zelensky is a positive step forward, but it is essential that both leaders follow through on their commitments. Ukraine has been through years of violence and suffering, and the world is watching closely. The two leaders must show that they are committed to finding a peaceful solution and must work together to end the conflict once and for all.

In conclusion, the meeting between Putin and Zelensky represents a significant step forward in the long-standing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The joint statement released by the two leaders signals a willingness to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, the road to peace is long and challenging, and both sides must follow through on their commitments. The world will be watching closely, and the success of the talks will depend on the actions of both leaders in the coming weeks and months.",1
13,A punch in the face for Xi caricature: Taiwan air force badge goes viral,"In recent days, a Taiwanese air force badge has become a viral sensation in the midst of growing tensions between Taiwan and China. The badge, which features a cartoon face with a resemblance to Chinese President Xi Jinping getting punched in the face, has been shared widely on social media.

The cartoon image is accompanied by the words, ""Freedom for Taiwan"", with a fighter jet soaring in the background. Taiwanese officials have said that the design was created to promote the country's commitment to defending itself against potential Chinese aggression.

However, the image has sparked outrage among officials in Beijing, who have accused Taiwan of promoting violence and stirring up nationalist sentiment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin condemned the image during a press conference, calling it ""a vulgar and vicious attack on a national leader.""

The badge has quickly become a symbol of the strained relations between Taiwan and China, which have been escalating in recent months. China considers Taiwan to be a renegade province, and has long sought to bring the island under its control, even though Taiwan functions as a sovereign state with its own government, military, and economy.

Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has been an outspoken critic of China's territorial claims and military advances in the disputed South China Sea. In her recent inauguration speech, she reaffirmed her commitment to defending Taiwan's sovereignty and called for greater international support for the island nation.

The badge is just the latest example of the ways in which Taiwan is pushing back against China's military and political ambitions. In the past, Taiwan has sought to strengthen its defense capabilities by purchasing advanced weapons systems from the United States, much to the ire of China.

Taiwan has also been actively courting support from other countries that share its concerns about China's growing power and influence. In recent years, Taiwan has deepened its economic ties with Japan and India, and has sought to establish closer diplomatic relations with countries in Southeast Asia.

The badge has also sparked a debate within Taiwan about the appropriate way to respond to China's aggression. While some have argued that Taiwan needs to take a hard line against China to protect its sovereignty, others fear that an escalation in tensions could lead to a military conflict.

Taiwan's military has sought to address these concerns by emphasizing its commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes, while also signaling its readiness to defend the island against any potential aggression from China. The air force has said that the badge was created to promote the message that Taiwan is a defender of freedom and democracy, and not to incite violence or promote anti-Chinese sentiment.

Despite these assurances, the badge has further inflamed tensions between Taiwan and China, and has become a lightning rod for criticism and condemnation from officials in Beijing. China has long resorted to economic and diplomatic pressure to exert its influence over Taiwan, and has recently stepped up military threats against the island nation.

The United States has also been closely monitoring the situation, with some officials expressing concern about the potential for a military confrontation between China and Taiwan. The U.S. maintains strong diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but has also sought to avoid provoking China by refraining from official recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state.

The Taiwanese air force badge has thus become a flashpoint in the ongoing struggles between Taiwan and China over sovereignty and political autonomy. While some have criticized the cartoon image as being overly provocative, others see it as a powerful symbol of Taiwan's determination to defend its freedom and democracy against Chinese aggression.

The tensions between Taiwan and China are likely to escalate in the coming months, as China continues to flex its military and economic power in the region. The Taiwanese government will need to navigate these challenges carefully, balancing its commitment to defending its sovereignty with the need to avoid provoking China into even more aggressive actions.

The air force badge is a reminder of the continuing struggle between Taiwan and China over the future of the island nation. Whether it further escalates tensions or serves as a rallying cry for Taiwan's defenders remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the fight for Taiwan's political autonomy and sovereignty is far from over.",1
14,"A 2019 hearing detailed potential fire hazards at the now-burning Indiana recycling plant, and its owner admitted a building did not have fire sprinklers","A 2019 hearing detailed potential fire hazards at the now-burning Indiana recycling plant, and its owner admitted a building did not have fire sprinklers.

The recycling plant located in Gary, Indiana, caught fire on Sunday, January 5th, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky, visible for miles. The fire has lasted for several days, making it one of the largest fires in the city's history. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, and thankfully no injuries have been reported.

However, the recent news of the potential fire hazards and the admission of the recycling plant owner, Environmental Cleansing Corporation (ECC), that a building did not have fire sprinklers, raises questions about the safety of this and potentially other industries in the Gary area. 

During a hearing in 2019 conducted by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), ECC was cited for several violations, including the accumulation of combustible materials in the building, which could increase the risk of a fire. In addition, ECC was informed that the lack of fire sprinklers in one of their buildings was a significant hazard.

According to the IDEM report, the lack of fire sprinklers was not only a potential fire hazard but also threatened the safety of workers and the surrounding community. The report stated that ""A fire in the Facility could rapidly develop and could have catastrophic consequences such as significant property damage or loss, serious injury, or loss of life.""

The report also raised concerns about the presence of hazardous materials in the building, including asbestos and lead, which could be released into the air during a fire, further endangering residents' health and safety.

During the hearing, ECC owner Richard Keys, acknowledged the building did not have fire sprinklers, stating that when the building was constructed, it was not required by the city, and the company did not see the need to install them.

Keys also admitted that the company had not addressed the accumulation of combustible materials in the building and promised to take steps to correct the problem.

Unfortunately, it appears that these steps were not taken in time, as the fire at the recycling plant continues to burn unchecked, with firefighters struggling to gain control of the flames.

The incident at ECC's recycling plant highlights the importance of regular inspections by regulatory bodies such as IDEM and the need for companies to take proactive steps to ensure their facilities are safe for their workers and the surrounding communities. 

It also shines a light on the potential dangers of the recycling industry. Recycling plants often deal with hazardous materials such as batteries and chemicals, which can pose a considerable risk to the environment and the public if not handled correctly. 

The lack of proper safety measures at recycling plants is not unique to Indiana, and incidents like this demonstrate the need for stricter regulation and industry-wide safety standards.

Samantha Williams, an environmental activist, commented on the incident, saying, ""It's a tragedy that we're seeing another incident like this. The recycling industry needs to take responsibility for the hazards it poses and make sure that worker safety and community health are a top priority.""

As the fire at the ECC recycling plant continues to burn, residents of Gary are advised to stay indoors and keep their windows closed to minimize their exposure to potentially hazardous, toxic smoke.

It is crucial that authorities and industries in the Gary area learn from this incident and take steps to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. The public wants to know that their safety is a top priority, and they can trust that companies are taking the necessary steps to protect them.

It's alarming to think that the potential for a disaster like this was identified in a hearing nearly two years ago, yet the situation was not adequately addressed, resulting in the current, devastating situation.

With incidents like this, authorities need to hold companies accountable for neglecting to implement safety measures, ultimately putting the lives and health of their employees and nearby residents at risk.

It's time for regulatory bodies to step up and enforce strict safety regulations to ensure that companies are doing everything possible to minimize potential hazards and ensure the safety of the public.

In conclusion, the fire at the ECC recycling plant is an unfortunate reminder of the importance of stringent safety regulation and the consequences of avoiding necessary safety measures. Let this be a wake-up call for authorities and perpetrators alike to prioritize safety, so incidents like this do not happen again in the future.",1

17,Father of Madeline Kingsbury's children denies involvement in missing Minnesota mother's disappearance,"The disappearance of Madeline Kingsbury, the 31-year-old Minnesota mother, has shaken the local community and sparked a widespread search effort. While authorities continue to investigate, the father of Kingsbury's children, Tyler Jensen, has publicly denied his involvement in the case.

Jensen spoke to CNN in an exclusive interview on Friday, stating that he was not responsible for Kingsbury's disappearance. ""I had nothing to do with it,"" he said firmly. ""I just want Madeline to come back home.""

Jensen and Kingsbury have two children together, a four-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl. They were reportedly separated but remained in contact as co-parents.

Kingsbury was last seen on March 22nd, leaving her job at a convenience store in Wadena, Minnesota. Her car was found abandoned in a ditch near Sebeka, Minnesota, the following day. Her phone and purse were still inside the vehicle.

Authorities have been tight-lipped about the details of the investigation, but have confirmed that they are treating Kingsbury's disappearance as a possible abduction. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Wadena County Sheriff's Office are both involved in the case.

Jensen expressed frustration with the lack of information coming from the authorities. ""I want to know what's going on as much as anyone else,"" he said. ""But they haven't told me anything.""

Jensen also addressed speculation on social media linking him to Kingsbury's disappearance. ""People are just trying to find someone to blame,"" he said. ""But I know in my heart that I had nothing to do with it.""

Despite their separation, Jensen said that he and Kingsbury had a good relationship as co-parents. ""We talked almost every day,"" he said. ""We were on good terms.""

Jensen acknowledged that there had been some issues in their relationship, but said that they had been working to address them. He also expressed concern for the welfare of their children, who are currently staying with his family.

""I just want to find out what happened to Madeline and bring her home,"" Jensen said. ""I want to be able to tell our kids that we did everything we could to find their mom.""

The community has been rallying around the search effort, with volunteers scouring the area for any clues to Kingsbury's whereabouts. A Facebook page dedicated to the search has over 1,000 members.

Anyone with information regarding Kingsbury's disappearance is asked to contact the Wadena County Sheriff's Office at (218) 631-7600.",1
18,"JPMorgan executives knew about sex abuse claims against then-client Jeffery Epstein, court filing alleges","In a shocking turn of events, a court filing has alleged that executives at JPMorgan knew about the sex abuse claims against their then-client Jeffery Epstein. The filing was made on behalf of two alleged victims seeking compensation from Epstein's estate. This revelation has raised eyebrows and calls into question the transparency and ethics of one of the world's largest banks.

Epstein, a convicted sex offender, committed suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking of minors. He had a long-standing relationship with JPMorgan dating back to the 1990s. JPMorgan was his primary bank and reportedly handled his vast wealth, which was estimated to be at least $500 million.

The court filing claims that JPMorgan executives knew about the sex abuse allegations against Epstein and continued to do business with him. It alleges that the bank ignored the red flags and allowed Epstein to use his accounts to pay off women and girls who accused him of sexual abuse.

One of the alleged victims named in the court filing is Lisa Jennings, who claims she was sexually abused by Epstein when she was a minor. She claims that JPMorgan executives knew about Epstein's behavior and that they were aware of the payments he made to her and other alleged victims. Jennings also claims that she was directed by Epstein to open an account at JPMorgan and deposit the money he gave her.

The other alleged victim named in the filing is Teresa Helm, who claims she was sexually abused by Epstein when she was 22 years old. Helm claims that JPMorgan executives knew about Epstein's behavior and that they allowed him to use his accounts to pay women to keep quiet about his abuse.

The court filing also alleges that JPMorgan employees raised concerns about Epstein's behavior but were told not to question the bank's relationship with him. The filing claims that JPMorgan's compliance department ignored these concerns and failed to report suspicious activity.

JPMorgan has not yet responded to the specific allegations made in the court filing. However, the bank has previously acknowledged that it had a relationship with Epstein and that it failed to adequately manage the risks associated with that relationship.

In a statement released in July 2020, JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon said, ""We conduct extensive due diligence on all of our clients and have processes in place to flag and address suspicious activity. In this case, we didn't get it right.""

JPMorgan's ties to Epstein have come under scrutiny in recent years, particularly since his death. The bank has faced criticism for its lack of transparency and its role in financing Epstein's activities.

One of the most damning allegations against JPMorgan is that it continued to do business with Epstein even after he was convicted of sex crimes in 2008. This is particularly troubling given that the bank has strict policies in place to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities.

The allegations against JPMorgan have raised concerns about the broader issue of banks' ethical responsibilities. Many argue that banks have a duty to ensure that they are not facilitating criminal behavior, particularly when the crimes involve vulnerable individuals like minors.

It's worth noting that JPMorgan is not the only bank that has faced criticism for its relationship with Epstein. Deutsche Bank, which also had a relationship with Epstein, has been fined $150 million by New York state regulators for its failure to properly monitor his accounts.

The fact that banks like JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were willing to do business with Epstein despite his criminal history raises questions about the incentives and priorities of these institutions. Are they focused solely on maximizing profits, or do they also have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure that they are not enabling criminal behavior?

The allegations against JPMorgan are likely to have significant implications for the bank. If the claims are proven to be true, it could face significant legal and reputational damage. It could also have broader implications for the financial industry as a whole.

The allegations against JPMorgan highlight the importance of transparency and accountability in the banking industry. If banks are going to play a key role in managing and distributing wealth, they need to be held to high ethical standards. This includes ensuring that they are not facilitating criminal behavior and that they are transparent about their financial dealings.

Hopefully, the outcome of this court filing will send a clear message to banks that they cannot ignore red flags and that they have a responsibility to ensure that they are not enabling criminal behavior.",1
19,NPR and PBS stop using Twitter after receiving 'government funded media' label,"Public broadcaster NPR (National Public Radio) and PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) have recently announced their decision to halt their use of Twitter after being labeled as ""government funded media"" by the social media platform.

The move came after Twitter launched a new labeling system for accounts that are funded by governments, including state-affiliated media outlets. The labels are meant to provide users with more transparency and context about the sources of information they are exposed to.

While Twitter's initiative has been praised by some as a step towards greater accountability and integrity, others argue that it could have unintended consequences, such as stifling free speech and promoting censorship.

NPR and PBS, both of which receive funding from the US government, were among the first media outlets to be labeled as ""government funded"" by Twitter. Although the labels are not necessarily negative, the public broadcasters expressed concern that they could be misinterpreted or used to discredit their journalism.

""We believe that the label is misleading and could be used to cast doubt on the credibility of our news reporting,"" said NPR in a statement. ""As a result, we have decided to suspend our use of Twitter until further notice.""

PBS also issued a similar statement, saying that it was ""disappointed"" by Twitter's decision and that it would be ""reviewing our social media strategy going forward.""

The move by NPR and PBS has sparked debate about the role of government funding in public media and the relationship between social media platforms and news organizations.

Some critics argue that the labels are a form of censorship and that they could be used by governments to undermine the credibility of independent media outlets.

""The labeling of media outlets as 'government funded' gives the impression that their reporting is biased or influenced by political agendas,"" said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Program at the New America Foundation. ""This could be used as a tool to silence dissenting voices and promote state propaganda.""

Others contend that the labels are necessary to provide transparency and accountability, especially in an era of fake news and propaganda.

""Twitter's labeling system is a positive development for media literacy and transparency,"" said Kyle Pope, editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review. ""It helps users to understand the sources of information they are consuming and to evaluate their credibility.""

The debate over government funding of public media is also a longstanding one. NPR and PBS have been criticized by some conservatives for being too biased towards liberal viewpoints and for relying too heavily on government subsidies.

In recent years, Republican lawmakers have attempted to cut funding to public media, arguing that it is not fair for taxpayers to finance news organizations that may be perceived as partisan or ideologically driven.

However, supporters of NPR and PBS counter that public media plays a vital role in promoting independent, non-partisan news coverage and that the government subsidies are necessary to maintain that independence.

They also argue that the funding represents a small fraction of the government budget and that cutting it would have a negligible impact on reducing the budget deficit.

The decision by NPR and PBS to suspend their use of Twitter has sparked a broader discussion about the relationship between news organizations and social media platforms.

Some have raised concerns that social media giants such as Twitter and Facebook have too much power over the distribution of news and information and that they need to be more accountable to the public.

Others argue that it is up to news organizations to maintain their own independence and credibility and to avoid relying too heavily on third-party platforms for their audience reach.

""This is a reminder that journalists should not be beholden to any one platform for their distribution,"" said Sarah Roberts, associate professor of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""It is important for journalists to cultivate their own audiences and to exercise independent judgment in their reporting.""

The decision by NPR and PBS to suspend their use of Twitter is likely to be the first of many reactions to the labeling system. As more media outlets are labeled as ""government funded,"" the debate over the role of public media and the relationship between social media and news organizations is sure to intensify.",1
20,"April 10, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news","April 10, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine News

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been boiling over in recent weeks, and the situation has escalated to dangerous levels. The world is watching as the two nations stand poised on the brink of war, and the stakes could not be higher.

Background

To understand the current crisis, we must first look at the history between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared independence and became a sovereign nation. Ukraine has a long and complex history with Russia, and the two nations have shared deep cultural and economic ties.

However, relations between the two nations have soured in recent years. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was overthrown in a revolution. In response, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine. These actions have led to economic sanctions against Russia and ongoing tensions between the two nations.

Current Situation

In recent weeks, tensions between Russia and Ukraine have reached a dangerous tipping point. On March 26, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree declaring the Russian Federation an ""aggressor state.""

The decree came in response to a Russian military buildup along the border with Ukraine. Russian troops have been massing in the region, and there are reports of tanks, artillery, and other heavy equipment being transported to the area.

Russian officials deny any intention of invading Ukraine, but their actions suggest otherwise. Satellite images show that Russian forces have built up a significant military presence near the border, and there are reports of Russian troops moving into Crimea.

Ukraine Responds

In response to the Russian military buildup, Ukraine has been mobilizing its own forces. The country has announced plans to increase its military spending and has begun calling up reservists. Ukrainian officials have warned that they will defend their country's sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.

Ukraine has also been seeking support from the international community. President Zelensky has been holding talks with leaders from Europe and the United States, urging them to take a strong stance against Russia's actions.

The United States has responded by sending warships to the Black Sea and expressing its support for Ukraine. Additionally, NATO has increased its presence in the region, and several European nations have sent military assistance to Ukraine.

Russia's Response

Russia has responded to Ukraine's actions by accusing the country of ""provocations"" and ""aggression."" Russian officials claim that the military buildup is simply a military exercise and that there is no intention of invading Ukraine.

However, many experts believe that Russia is preparing for an invasion. The Russian military buildup is unprecedented, and it is clear that Russia is taking the situation very seriously.

Potential Consequences

The potential consequences of a Russia-Ukraine war are dire. The conflict could lead to a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians caught in the crossfire. It could also lead to a wider conflict, with other nations taking sides and getting involved in the fighting.

Additionally, a war between Russia and Ukraine could have significant implications for global security. The two nations possess nuclear weapons, and a conflict between them could lead to a nuclear war.

The international community has been calling for calm and urging both parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. However, it is unclear at this point whether Russia and Ukraine will be able to resolve their differences diplomatically.

Conclusion

The situation between Russia and Ukraine is extremely tense, and the world is watching with bated breath. The stakes are high, and the potential consequences of a war between the two nations are dire.

As journalists, it is our responsibility to report on this crisis accurately and objectively. We must keep the international community informed about the situation and the potential implications of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

We must continue to call for a peaceful resolution to the crisis and urge both parties to come to the table to negotiate a solution. The world cannot afford to have another conflict, especially one that could lead to global devastation.",1
21,Nick Cannon thinks he and Taylor Swift have something in common,"In a recent interview, Nick Cannon, the well-known rapper and television host, revealed that he thinks he and pop superstar Taylor Swift have something in common. While many might question what could possibly link the two celebrities, Cannon was quick to answer.

According to Cannon, both he and Swift have dealt with public scrutiny and criticism throughout their careers. Cannon stated that as someone who has been in the public eye for many years, he empathizes with the pressure that Swift has faced from the media and fans alike.

Cannon also praised Swift for her talent and work ethic. He noted that despite the constant attention and criticism, she has continued to produce hit music and maintain a successful career.

Some might find it surprising that Cannon sees a connection between himself and Swift, as they come from vastly different musical genres and backgrounds. However, the shared experience of being a public figure has clearly left an impression on Cannon.

Swift, who has been known to speak out about the challenges of living in the public eye, has yet to respond to Cannon's comments. However, it is clear that she has earned the respect of fellow musicians like Cannon who recognize the difficulties of navigating fame and success.

Whether or not Swift and Cannon will collaborate on any future projects remains to be seen. But for now, it is refreshing to see celebrities reaching across musical and cultural boundaries to find common ground.",1
22,Arnold Schwarzenegger terminates neighborhood pothole,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Governor of California and action-movie star, has taken it upon himself to rid his Los Angeles neighborhood of annoying potholes. 

Schwarzenegger, who is often seen walking his dog around his Brentwood neighborhood, took to Twitter to voice his frustration with the state of the roads. He tweeted a photo of himself holding a shovel with the caption, ""I don't drive on the streets, but my friends and family do. This is unacceptable. #TerminateThePotholes."" 

Since then, Schwarzenegger has been spotted filling potholes himself, donning a fluorescent vest and gloves. His efforts have not gone unnoticed as neighbors have taken to social media to thank him for his hard work. 

In an interview with CNN, Schwarzenegger stated that he feels a responsibility to his community and wants to help make a difference. ""I have always believed that it's important to give back to the community and to help where you can. It may seem like a small thing, but fixing these potholes can make a big difference for drivers and pedestrians alike."" 

Schwarzenegger's enthusiasm has sparked a conversation online about the responsibility of public officials to take action in their communities. Some have even suggested that he should run for political office again. 

While it remains to be seen if Schwarzenegger will take on another political role in the future, for now, he is content with his efforts to terminate the potholes in his neighborhood.",1

26,"Infertility affects a 'staggering' 1 in 6 people worldwide, WHO says","According to a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO), infertility affects a staggering one in six people worldwide. The report highlights the need for improved access to health care services, particularly for developing countries where fertility treatments are often out of reach for the average person.

The WHO defines infertility as “a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse.” The report cites a range of factors that can contribute to infertility, including sexually transmitted infections, maternal age, and lifestyle factors such as tobacco and alcohol use.

Infertility can also be caused by environmental factors such as exposure to toxic chemicals or radiation. In some cases, infertility may be the result of medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis.

The report underscores the significant psychological and social ramifications of infertility, noting that the inability to conceive can have a profound impact on mental health, social relationships, and economic stability. Fertility treatments can also be costly, placing an additional burden on families who may already be struggling.

In response to these challenges, the WHO calls for increased access to affordable and effective infertility treatments. The report calls on policymakers to prioritize funding for infertility research and care, particularly for disadvantaged populations in low-income countries.

The WHO’s report highlights the global scope of the infertility crisis, noting that it affects individuals and families in every region of the world. However, the report also notes that the burden of infertility is particularly acute in developing countries.

According to the WHO, infertility care is often expensive and inaccessible in developing countries, leading many couples to forgo treatment altogether. The lack of access to care can lead to further disparities in health outcomes and economic stability, particularly for women who may face social stigma and discrimination as a result of their infertility.

The report emphasizes the need for better education and awareness surrounding infertility, particularly in low-income countries where cultural taboos and misinformation may prevent individuals from seeking care. The WHO argues that by breaking down these barriers, individuals and families can access the care and support they need to build healthy and fulfilling lives.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, called infertility “a neglected health issue.” He stated that “everyone has the right to make decisions about their own body and future, including their reproductive and sexual health. Infertility can undermine both of these values, and it’s time for us to take action.”

The WHO’s report has drawn attention from a variety of stakeholders, with many experts calling for increased funding for infertility research and treatment. Dr. Catherine Racowsky, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School, stated that “it’s critical that we invest in improving access to care for infertility, particularly in developing countries where individuals may not have the resources or awareness to seek care.”

Others have emphasized the need for increased awareness and education about infertility, particularly among young women who may be at risk for developing conditions such as PCOS or endometriosis.

Jennifer Hettema, a professor of psychology at the University of New Mexico and an expert in health behavior change, stated that “we need to start talking about infertility openly and honestly. We need to break down the taboos and stigma surrounding infertility so that individuals and families can access the care and support they need.”

Hettema also emphasized the importance of supporting individuals and families who are struggling with infertility, stating that “it’s important that we provide care and support for individuals who are going through the infertility journey. This includes psychological support, as well as support for family planning and child-rearing.”

Overall, the WHO’s report underscores the significant impact of infertility on individuals, families, and societies around the world. By raising awareness and promoting access to care, policymakers and healthcare providers can work together to address this pressing health issue and promote health and wellbeing for all individuals and families.",1
27,Russian warships conduct anti-submarine exercises in Asian waters,"Russian warships are conducting anti-submarine exercises in Asian waters, raising concerns among neighboring countries about the growing military presence of Russia beyond its borders.

According to a statement from the Russian navy, the exercises involve several destroyers and submarines, and are being held in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. The drills are said to focus on detecting and tracking enemy submarines, which suggests that Russia may be preparing for possible conflict scenarios in the region.

The exercises come amid heightened tensions in the region, particularly on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea's ballistic missile program and nuclear tests have raised alarm bells among its neighbors and the international community. Russia has been involved in efforts to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but its military exercises suggest that it is also preparing for other scenarios, including a possible conflict with the United States.

The exercises are also likely to draw attention from China, which has been wary of Russia's growing military presence in the region. China and Russia have collaborated on a number of economic and military projects in recent years, but they have also had their disagreements over territorial and geopolitical issues.

The United States, which has been an influential player in the region for decades, may also view Russia's exercises as a challenge to its interests in Asia. The Trump administration has been vocal about its concerns over North Korea's nuclear program, and has sought to pressure China to use its leverage to rein in Pyongyang.

It remains unclear how the United States will respond to the Russian exercises, but it is possible that it may increase its military presence in the region in response. This could further escalate tensions in an already volatile region, and raise concerns about the potential for military conflict.

The Russian navy has said that the exercises are part of its routine training and that they are not directed against any specific country. However, the timing and location of the drills suggest that they are aimed at sending a message of strength and deterrence to Russia's rivals in the region.

The exercises come at a time when Russia's military capabilities are increasingly being tested in other parts of the world. Russian involvement in the Syrian conflict, as well as its annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, have drawn criticism from Western countries and led to the imposition of sanctions.

Russia has sought to assert itself on the global stage, and its military exercises in Asia are a clear indication of its growing ambitions. The United States and its allies will be closely watching the developments in the region, and considering their own responses to the growing military presence of Russia in Asia.",1

29,"'I don't trust myself.' For Muslims with eating disorders, fasting in Ramadan brings another set of challenges","In the Muslim community, there is a strong emphasis on fasting during the holy month of Ramadan. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims are encouraged to refrain from food, water, and other physical needs as a way to purify their minds and bodies.

For those with eating disorders, however, fasting can bring another set of challenges. These individuals may already struggle with their relationship with food, and fasting can only exacerbate these issues.

""I don't trust myself,"" says Sara, a Muslim woman from the United States who has struggled with anorexia for several years. ""When I fast, I feel like I have even less control over my eating habits. It's a dangerous slippery slope for me.""

Sara's story is not unique. According to the National Eating Disorder Association, up to 10 million people in the United States are living with eating disorders. While there is no data specifically on the number of Muslim individuals with eating disorders, it is safe to assume that there are many who struggle with this issue, especially during Ramadan.

For Muslims with eating disorders, the pressure to fast during Ramadan can be overwhelming. Many fear the judgment of their community if they choose not to fast, or worry that they will be seen as weak in their faith.

""There is a lot of shame and guilt associated with not fasting,"" says Amina*, a Muslim woman from Canada who has struggled with bulimia for several years. ""I feel like if I don't fast, I'm not a good Muslim.""

But for those with eating disorders, fasting can be incredibly dangerous. It can trigger binge-purge cycles, increase feelings of anxiety and depression, and lead to physical complications like dehydration, dizziness, and fainting.

""I know that fasting is supposed to be good for the soul, but for me, it's just not worth the risk,"" says Amina.

Despite the risks, many Muslims with eating disorders feel like they have no choice but to fast. In some cases, their families may pressure them to do so, or they may feel like they are not truly participating in Ramadan if they do not fast.

""It's a catch-22,"" says Sara. ""I want to be a good Muslim, but I also want to take care of myself. It's hard to find a balance.""

For some, that balance means modifying the fast to make it safer for their health. This could mean breaking the fast at regular intervals throughout the day, rather than abstaining from food and water completely. It could also mean seeking guidance from a therapist or religious leader to help them navigate these challenges.

""It's important for individuals with eating disorders to seek support and not feel alone in this struggle,"" says Dr. Fatima Akhtar, a licensed therapist based in Chicago who works primarily with Muslim clients. ""There is no one right way to navigate Ramadan and fasting, and it's okay to listen to your body and do what feels safe and healthy for you.""

Religious leaders also have an important role to play in supporting Muslims with eating disorders during Ramadan. They can provide guidance and education on the importance of mental health and self-care, and help dispel myths and stereotypes around eating disorders.

""Religious leaders have a responsibility to create a safe and inclusive space for all members of the community, including those with eating disorders,"" says Dr. Akhtar. ""By acknowledging the challenges that some individuals may face during Ramadan, and providing resources and support, we can help ensure that everyone feels included and valued.""

One organization that is working to provide support and education around eating disorders during Ramadan is the Muslim Mental Health & Islamic Psychology Network (MMHIPN). Founded by Dr. Rania Awaad, a psychiatrist and the director of the Muslim Mental Health Lab at Stanford University, the network aims to promote mental health and well-being in the Muslim community.

""Our mission is to bring together mental health professionals, religious scholars, and community leaders to address the unique mental health needs of the Muslim community,"" says Dr. Awaad. ""During Ramadan, we focus on providing resources and support for individuals who may be struggling with eating disorders.""

Through webinars, workshops, and social media campaigns, MMHIPN aims to raise awareness about the challenges that Muslims with eating disorders may face during Ramadan, and provide guidance on how to stay safe and healthy while still honoring the traditions of the holy month.

""We want to create a space where individuals with eating disorders feel seen and heard, and where they know that they are not alone,"" says Dr. Awaad.

For Sara, participating in MMHIPN's webinars and support groups has been a lifeline during Ramadan. She has found comfort in connecting with others who understand her struggles, and has learned strategies for managing her eating disorder during the fast.

""It's been so helpful to know that there are resources out there for people like me,"" she says. ""I don't feel as alone anymore.""

While there is still much work to be done in addressing the unique challenges that Muslims with eating disorders face during Ramadan, organizations like MMHIPN are making important strides in promoting mental health and well-being in the Muslim community.

""I hope that more people will start to recognize the importance of mental health and the impact that eating disorders can have on individuals and families,"" says Amina. ""We need to create a more compassionate and understanding community that supports everyone, regardless of their health status.""

For Muslims with eating disorders, Ramadan can be a time of both spiritual reflection and physical and emotional struggle. By acknowledging these challenges and providing support and resources, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all members.",1

32,Egyptian official rejects leaked intelligence suggesting nation's military was producing weapons for Russia,"Cairo, Egypt - A high-ranking Egyptian official has dismissed intelligence reports that the country's military was producing weapons for Russia, according to a statement released on Tuesday.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, denied the allegations that appeared in western media last week, stating that such reports were ""baseless rumors.""

""The Egyptian military has no involvement in the production of weapons for any foreign country, including Russia. These are unfounded rumors that aim to undermine our national security,"" the official said.

The reports emerged last week, citing unnamed sources as saying that Egypt's military was involved in the production of the Russian BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle. The sources claimed that the production was taking place at an undisclosed location in Egypt, with Russian advisers providing technical help.

Following the reports, some western countries expressed concern over the alleged cooperation between Egypt and Russia. The United States, in particular, warned of potential sanctions against Egypt if the claims were found to be true.

However, the Egyptian official denied any such cooperation with Russia, stating that the country's military was fully committed to its relations with the US and other western countries.

""The relationship between Egypt and the US is based on mutual respect and shared interests. The Egyptian military has long-standing partnerships with the US armed forces and is dedicated to maintaining these ties,"" the official said.

Egypt has been a strategic partner of the United States for decades, receiving billions of dollars in military aid annually. The country has also maintained close military ties with Russia in recent years, with both countries holding joint military exercises and discussing potential arms deals.

However, the recent intelligence reports threatened to strain Egypt's relationship with its western partners and undermine its reputation as a reliable US ally in the Middle East.

In response, the Egyptian official called on western media to refrain from spreading false information about Egypt's military and its relationship with foreign countries.

""We urge the media to exercise caution and to verify the accuracy of their sources before reporting on sensitive issues such as national security,"" the official said.

The statement comes amid growing concerns over the increased Russian military presence in the Middle East and its impact on regional stability. The alleged cooperation between Egypt and Russia raised fears that Moscow was seeking to expand its influence in the region at the expense of western-backed countries.

However, the Egyptian official's denial of the reports may help ease tensions between Egypt and its western partners, and reassure observers of the country's commitment to its longstanding alliances.",1
33,'None of us deserved it': Americans who survived kidnapping in Mexico share details of their captivity,"On a sunny afternoon in August 2019, Tamara and Luis were driving across the Mexican state of Tamaulipas when their lives changed forever. The young couple, both American citizens, were kidnapped by a group of armed men and held captive for over a week.

Speaking exclusively to CNN, Tamara and Luis shared harrowing details of their kidnapping and captivity. They requested their last names be withheld to protect their privacy.

""None of us deserved it,"" Tamara said. ""We were just going about our lives, minding our own business, and suddenly we were taken from our families and our freedom.""

Tamara, who is originally from Texas, had visited Mexico with Luis, who is from California, to visit his family. They were driving from a border town to a city in Tamaulipas when they were intercepted by the kidnappers.

""They came out of nowhere, with guns pointed at us,"" Luis said. ""They forced us out of the car and blindfolded us. We were pushed into a van and taken to a house.""

For the next nine days, the couple was held in a small room with no windows. They were given minimal amounts of food and water and forced to use a bucket as a toilet.

""We didn't know if we were going to die or if we would ever see our families again,"" Tamara said. ""It was the toughest thing we've ever been through.""

The kidnappers demanded a ransom of $500,000 for the release of the couple. Tamara and Luis' families worked tirelessly with the FBI and Mexican authorities to negotiate their release.

After several days, the kidnappers agreed to release the couple for a reduced ransom of $50,000. Tamara and Luis' families managed to scrape together the funds and deliver them to the kidnappers in a remote location.

""We were told to start walking towards a road after they received the money,"" Luis said. ""They told us not to look back and to keep walking until we found help.""

The couple eventually stumbled upon a Mexican military checkpoint, where they were taken to safety and reunited with their families.

Kidnappings and violent crime are a growing concern in Mexico, particularly in the northern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. According to the US State Department, kidnappings in Mexico are often violent, with victims subjected to physical abuse, rape or other forms of torture.

In recent years, several high-profile US citizens have been kidnapped and held for ransom in Mexico. In 2018, a group of American tourists were kidnapped in the state of Guerrero and later released. Also in 2018, a California woman was kidnapped while visiting her boyfriend in Tijuana.

The US State Department warns US citizens to exercise increased caution when traveling in Mexico due to crime and kidnapping. It recommends avoiding travel to certain areas of the country, including states like Tamaulipas.

Despite the dangers, many Americans continue to travel to Mexico for tourism or to visit family. Tamara and Luis say they hope their story will serve as a cautionary tale for others traveling to the country.

""It's important to be aware of the risks and to take precautions,"" Tamara said. ""We never thought something like this could happen to us, but it did. All we can do now is try to move forward and heal.""

Luis added: ""We're extremely grateful to be alive and to be back with our families. We don't take our freedom for granted anymore.""

The couple praised the efforts of the FBI and Mexican authorities, but also expressed frustration with the lack of communication and support they received from the US government.

""We felt like we were on our own,"" Tamara said. ""We barely heard from the US Embassy or anyone from the government. It was a very isolating experience.""

Their story highlights the challenges and complexities of dealing with kidnappings in Mexico, where corruption and impunity are rampant. Families often resort to hiring private negotiators or working with law enforcement officials, but success is never guaranteed.

Tamara and Luis say they are still dealing with the psychological trauma of their ordeal, but are working to rebuild their lives and move past the nightmare.

""It's a slow process, but we're taking it one day at a time,"" Tamara said. ""We're trying to focus on the positive and be thankful for every day we have.""",1
34,Jozzy: Meet the artist Diddy called 'the R&B Biggie',"Jozzy is making waves in the music industry and catching the attention of some of the biggest names in the game. With her soulful voice and relatable lyrics, the Memphis-born artist is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the R&B world - and she's just getting started.

Jozzy, whose real name is Joelle James, got her start in the industry as a songwriter, penning tracks for artists like Chris Brown, Beyoncé and Usher. But it wasn't long before she decided to step into the spotlight herself, releasing her debut single ""Push Thru"" in 2018.

Since then, Jozzy has been steadily building her following with her honest and introspective songs. Her latest release, ""NAAHH F/ Lil Wayne,"" has already racked up over 3 million views on YouTube and caught the attention of none other than Diddy, who dubbed her ""the R&B Biggie"" in a recent Instagram post.

But for Jozzy, the comparison to the late Notorious B.I.G. isn't just about her lyrical prowess - it's also about her dedication to authenticity and honesty in her music.

""I think he was one of the most authentic rappers to ever do it, and that's what I really try to embody,"" she said in an interview with Complex. ""I feel like the most successful artists are open books, and that's what I try to be with my music. I try to always be transparent and share my experiences with my fans.""

One of those experiences, as Jozzy has been open about, is her struggle with anxiety and depression. In her music, she explores the highs and lows of her mental health journey, opening up about her personal experiences in a way that's both vulnerable and relatable.

""I want people to know that they're not alone,"" she said in an interview with Rolling Stone. ""If somebody can hear my music and feel like they're understood and somebody else is going through the same thing, then I'm doing my job.""

And it's clear that Jozzy's message is resonating with fans. Her social media is filled with messages from people who have been moved by her music and inspired by her honesty.

""I just wanna Thank you soo much for making music that speaks to my soul,"" one fan wrote on Twitter. ""You make me feel less alone with anxiety and depression. Your music is powerful.""

Jozzy's talents have also caught the attention of her peers in the industry. In addition to working with Lil Wayne on her latest single, she's collaborated with artists like Ty Dolla $ign, Tory Lanez and Dreamville's Ari Lennox.

But despite all of her success so far, Jozzy still feels like there's more work to be done.

""I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface yet,"" she said in an interview with Billboard. ""I have so much more to give musically and creatively, and I'm just excited for the world to see it.""

For now, Jozzy is focusing on building her fanbase and perfecting her craft. But with A-listers like Diddy and Lil Wayne singing her praises, it's clear that she's well on her way to becoming a household name.

""Thank you for creating timeless music,"" Diddy wrote on Instagram. ""Welcome to the Bad Boy family, Jozzy. Let's make history.""",1

38,Here is what an insect flicking pee from its butt teaches us about engineering,"Entomologists have discovered that one tiny insect has a unique way of flicking away pee from its butt. This method of staying clean and dry is fascinating to observe, but it also has practical applications for engineers. The flicking motion has inspired a team of engineers at Duke University to develop a new type of water-repellant surface that could be used in a variety of applications, from self-cleaning solar panels to medical implants. The secret to the insect's flicking success lies in the microscopic hairs on its feet that repel water. By mimicking this structure, the engineers believe they could revolutionize the way we interact with water in everyday life.",1

43,"National Recording Registry adds Madonna, John Lennon and Mariah Carey classics, plus Super Mario Bros. theme","The National Recording Registry has added a diverse mix of classics to its collection, ranging from pop legends Madonna and Mariah Carey to iconic video game soundtrack Super Mario Bros. theme, and the legendary John Lennon.

Established in 2000, the National Recording Registry is a collaborative program of the Library of Congress and the National Recording Preservation Foundation, which aims to preserve and promote culturally and historically significant audio recordings in the United States.

The Registry has been known to celebrate numerous classic recordings and notable moments of American history, with recordings ranging from popular music to spoken word, and famous speeches.

This year, however, the Registry has added quite the eclectic mix of recordings. Amongst the artists now included in this elite group is the Queen of Pop herself, Madonna, and her iconic 1989 hit, ""Like a Prayer."" The song, which touches on religion and sexuality, was an instant classic and became one of the singer's biggest hits, reaching the top of charts worldwide.

In a statement, the Library of Congress called the song ""a ground-breaking fusion of gospel and dance music that defined an era."" The Registry also recognized the music video for ""Like a Prayer,"" which was similarly groundbreaking and is often cited as one of the most controversial and influential music videos of all time.

Another female powerhouse added to this year's list is Mariah Carey, and her hit single ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" The holiday classic, which was released in 1994, has become a staple during the festive season and a commercial success, earning more than $60 million in royalties since its release.

The Registry cited the song's catchy melody and Carey's impressive vocal range as reasons for its inclusion, while also noting that it has become ""a quintessential Christmas song."" The song's success even inspired a children's book adaptation titled Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You.""

One of the most recognizable and beloved video game songs of all time, the ""Super Mario Bros."" theme, has also been added to this year's list. Originally composed by Koji Kondo and released alongside the iconic video game in 1985, the song has become synonymous with the Mario franchise and gaming as a whole.

The Registry noted that the song's ""immediacy and simplicity"" make it one of the most memorable video game tracks of all time, while also praising its impact on popular culture, with the song's recognizable tune being sampled in countless other media.

Finally, the Registry has added a posthumous honor to the late John Lennon, with his 1971 album ""Imagine"" being included in this year's collection. The album, which was Lennon's second solo release following his departure from The Beatles, is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time and has been hailed for its messages of peace and unity.

The Registry noted the album's continued relevance in today's political climate, stating that it ""continues to inspire people all over the world to work towards a more equitable and just society.""

The addition of these classic recordings to the National Recording Registry is not only a celebration of their individual cultural significance, but also a recognition of their overall influence on American history and society as a whole.

By preserving these recordings, the Registry is able to ensure that future generations will be able to appreciate their impact and significance, and continue to learn from them. It also serves as a reminder of the power of music and the arts in shaping our culture, and how they can play an instrumental role in promoting social change.

As Dr. Carla Hayden, the Librarian of Congress, said in a statement, ""This year's exciting list gives us a full range of sound experiences. These sounds of the past enrich our understanding of the nation's cultural history and our history in general.""

The National Recording Registry continues to be an important institution in promoting and preserving American cultural heritage, and the inclusion of these iconic recordings is a testament to its ongoing commitment to this goal.  So, this inclusion of amazingly popular sounds will continue to breathe our love and admiration for music and other forms of artistic expression.",1
44,Six community colleges to offer tuition-free education for all Boston residents,"Boston Mayor, Martin J. Walsh, announced yesterday that six community colleges in the city will offer tuition-free education for all residents of Boston starting next year.

This initiative aims to increase access to higher education for low-income and underrepresented communities in the city, which have been hit hard by the pandemic.

The community colleges that will be participating in this program are Bunker Hill Community College, Roxbury Community College, MassBay Community College, North Shore Community College, Quincy College, and Middlesex Community College. They are all members of the Massachusetts Community College System.

The program will cover tuition and fees for all students enrolled in associate degree and certificate programs offered by these colleges. The cost of textbooks and other course materials will not be covered by the program.

Mayor Walsh said in a statement that the tuition-free program will provide a critical opportunity for Boston residents to improve their skills, increase their earning potential, and achieve their career goals.

""This program will help thousands of Bostonians get the education they need to succeed in the workforce and in life,"" said Mayor Walsh. ""We want to make higher education accessible to everyone, regardless of their income or background.""

To be eligible for the program, students must be residents of Boston and have a high school diploma or equivalent. They must also maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 and take at least six credit hours per semester.

According to the mayor's office, the city will allocate $20 million from its budget to support the tuition-free program for the next five years.

Boston joins a growing number of cities and states across the country that are offering tuition-free education programs for residents. The hope is that these programs will provide opportunities for low-income and underrepresented communities to obtain education and skills that could lead to better careers and lives.",1
45,Tupperware: How a plastic bowl with a 'burp seal' gave women a means to an income,"In the 1940s, women were making a slow but steady transition from homemaker to the workforce. As World War II raged on, more and more women found themselves taking on jobs in factories and offices traditionally held by men. However, the majority of women were still kept at home, confined to their roles as mothers and wives.

One of the biggest challenges for women at this time was finding a way to make money from home. With few options available, many women resorted to selling homemade goods or taking in laundry to earn a little extra cash. But in 1946, one woman came up with a revolutionary idea that would not only change the lives of millions of women, but would also create an entirely new industry: Tupperware.

Earl Tupper, a chemist with a passion for creating new materials, had spent years developing a type of plastic that was both durable and flexible. He believed that this plastic could be used to create a range of products, from kitchen utensils to toys. However, he struggled to find a way to sell these products.

That's where Brownie Wise came in. Wise, an energetic and ambitious woman from Detroit, had been working as a salesperson for Stanley Home Products when she met Tupper. She immediately saw the potential in his plastic products and suggested that he sell them through home parties – a concept that was just beginning to gain traction.

Tupper agreed and gave Wise exclusive rights to sell his products through this new model. She started with small-scale parties at her home, inviting friends and neighbors to learn about the benefits of Tupperware and purchase items on the spot. As word spread, Wise's parties grew bigger and bigger.

One of the keys to Wise's success was her ability to make Tupperware more than just a plastic container. She focused on the multiple benefits of the product: its durability, its flexibility, and its unique ""burp seal"" that kept food fresher for longer. She also knew that women at the time were looking for ways to save money and make their lives easier – and Tupperware fit the bill perfectly.

Wise began recruiting other women to sell Tupperware at their own parties, earning a commission on each sale. The company grew quickly, and within a few years, there were thousands of Tupperware parties happening each month across the United States.

One of the most remarkable things about Tupperware was how it transformed women's lives. For the first time, women had a way to make money from home that didn't involve labor-intensive tasks like sewing or laundry. They could host Tupperware parties during the day while their children were at school or in the evening after dinner. They could work as much or as little as they wanted, depending on their individual needs.

For many women, Tupperware became a lifeline. It provided a way to supplement their household income, pay for their children's education, or save for a rainy day. It also gave them a sense of purpose and accomplishment – something that was sorely lacking for many housewives at the time.

The success of Tupperware was driven by a perfect storm of factors. First, there was the product itself – a high-quality, innovative item that met a very real need. Second, there was the business model – the idea of selling products through parties was new and exciting, and it allowed women to earn money in a way that was flexible and fun.

But perhaps most important was the timing. Tupperware arrived on the scene just as women were starting to look for ways to break free from their traditional roles. The war had given many women a taste of what it was like to have a job outside the home, and they didn't want to go back to a life of isolation and dependency.

Tupperware tapped into this desire for independence and provided women with a way to assert themselves in the world. As one Tupperware seller put it, ""We may be housewives, but we’re not just housewives. We’re somebody. We count.""

The impact of Tupperware went beyond just the financial benefits it provided. It also created a sense of community among its sellers. Women who might never have met otherwise came together at Tupperware parties, sharing tips and stories and forming lasting friendships. The company even held annual Jubilee events – essentially giant Tupperware parties – that brought together thousands of women for a weekend of celebration and empowerment.

Of course, Tupperware was not without its controversies. Brownie Wise, who had been instrumental in the company's success, was eventually forced out by Earl Tupper. Some sources suggest that Tupper was uncomfortable with the amount of attention Wise was getting and was also concerned about the power she wielded within the company.

After Wise's departure, Tupperware continued to thrive. In the 1960s and 70s, the company expanded overseas, becoming a truly global brand. Today, Tupperware products are sold in more than 100 countries, and the company employs over 13,000 people worldwide.

But even as the company has grown and diversified, its roots in empowering women have remained strong. In 2018, Tupperware committed to empowering 1 million women in the next five years through training programs and partnerships with organizations like CARE and FEMSA Foundation.

In many ways, Tupperware was ahead of its time. It recognized the potential of women as entrepreneurs long before the concept was mainstream. It created a business model that valued flexibility and community over rigid structure. And perhaps most importantly, it gave women a way to earn money and gain independence without sacrificing their roles as mothers and caregivers.

As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of Tupperware, we should remember the impact this simple plastic bowl with a ""burp seal"" had on the lives of millions of women.

The study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, analyzed data from over 36,000 adults aged 65 years or older. The participants were initially assessed in 1997-1998 and were followed for up to 18 years.

The study found that older adults who reported intentionally losing weight within the past year had a 24% higher risk of death from all causes, a 41% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and a 68% higher risk of death from cancer compared to those who did not intentionally lose weight.

While it is widely recognized that obesity is a major health concern, the study’s findings suggest that weight loss may not be the solution for older adults. Instead, a focus on maintaining a healthy weight and a balanced diet may be more beneficial.

The authors of the study, led by Dr. Eileen Rillamas-Sun, suggest that intentional weight loss may lead to the loss of muscle mass, which can be detrimental to overall health. According to Dr. Rillamas-Sun, “Loss of muscle mass or strength can increase the risk of falls, decrease mobility or the ability to do normal activities of daily living, and can result in longer hospital stays.”

The study’s findings are particularly concerning given the high rates of intentional weight loss amongst older adults. In the United States, it is estimated that over 40% of adults aged 60 years or older are obese, and many seek to lose weight to improve their health and quality of life.

However, the study’s authors caution that these findings should not discourage older adults from maintaining a healthy weight. Instead, they suggest that “older adults should be encouraged to engage in physical activity and consume a healthy diet that includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy, lean meats, and poultry.”

This sentiment is echoed by other health experts who stress the importance of a balanced approach to weight management. Dr. Lisa Schilling, an obesity specialist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, suggests that “diet and exercise should be about feeling healthy and feeling better, rather than about achieving an ideal weight.”

The study’s findings may also have implications for healthcare providers who work with older adults. The authors suggest that healthcare providers should monitor patients’ weight and muscle mass, and encourage healthy lifestyle changes rather than promoting weight loss.

Overall, the study’s findings highlight the complex relationship between weight loss and health in older adults. While maintaining a healthy weight is important, intentional weight loss may not be the answer. Instead, a focus on healthy lifestyle choices and a balanced approach to weight management may be more beneficial for older adults’ health and wellbeing. 

It is important to note that this study does have limitations, such as relying on participants to self-report their weight loss and not taking into account the reasons behind the weight loss. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between intentional weight loss and mortality in older adults. Regardless, these findings offer valuable insight into the complexities of weight management and its impact on health in later life.",1

49,"Pet cats and dogs may help protect infants from food allergies, study suggests","A new study suggests that pets may help protect infants from developing food allergies later in life. Researchers found that exposure to pet cats and dogs during a baby's first year of life can lead to a lower risk of developing allergies to certain types of food.

The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from over 1,000 children and their families across Canada. The researchers found that infants who had furry pets in the home during their first year of life had a lower risk of developing food allergies by the age of three.

""Our findings suggest that pet exposure during infancy may protect against food allergy development,"" the study's lead author, Dr. Heinrich J. Kraft, a pediatrician and researcher at the University of Alberta, said in a statement.

The study found that exposure to pet cats and dogs was associated with a lower risk of developing allergies to eggs, peanuts, and milk. The researchers also found that children who were exposed to pets during their first year of life had higher levels of certain gut bacteria that are known to be beneficial for the immune system.

Previous studies have shown that exposure to pets can have positive effects on a child's immune system. For example, a study published last year found that exposure to pets during pregnancy and in the first year of life was associated with a lower risk of asthma and allergies in children.

The new study builds on this research by specifically looking at the impact of pet exposure on food allergies, which are becoming increasingly common in children. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 4% to 6% of children in the United States have a food allergy.

The study's authors caution that the findings do not mean that parents should rush out to adopt pets in order to protect their children from allergies. The researchers stress that further research is needed to confirm their findings and to better understand the role that pets play in protecting against allergies.

""We don't want to give parents the impression that getting a pet will necessarily protect their child from allergies,"" Dr. Kraft said. ""More research is needed to determine how and why certain pets may have a protective effect.""

The study's authors also note that parents should take appropriate precautions when introducing pets to their infants in order to prevent the risk of infections or injuries. For example, parents should ensure that their pets are vaccinated and free from parasites, and should supervise their child's interactions with pets to prevent accidents.

Despite these caveats, the study's findings are likely to be welcomed by many pet owners, who have long believed that their furry friends can have a positive impact on their health.

""Our findings suggest that exposure to pets during infancy may help to build a stronger immune system in children, reducing their risk of developing allergies,"" Dr. Kraft said. ""This is yet another reason for pet owners to appreciate the many benefits that their pets provide."" 

In conclusion, if you have a pet in your house, it is more likely to protect your child from developing food allergies. However, this study does not mean that parents should rush out to adopt pets in order to protect their children from allergies, more research is required to confirm their findings.",1

52,David Beckham Fast Facts,"David Beckham Fast Facts

David Beckham is one of the most recognizable soccer players of all time. With a storied career that spanned over 20 years, he cemented his place as a global icon both on and off the pitch. From his early days at Manchester United to his time with Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, and PSG, Beckham has always been a force to be reckoned with. Here are some fast facts about the man himself:

Early Life

David Robert Joseph Beckham was born on May 2nd, 1975, in Leytonstone, London. His parents were both fanatical Manchester United supporters, and they passed their love of the club down to Beckham.

Beckham started playing soccer at a young age and was quickly spotted by scouts from various clubs. He joined Manchester United's youth team when he was just 14 years old, and by the time he was 16, he had signed his first professional contract with the club.

Manchester United Career

Beckham quickly established himself as a key player for Manchester United's first team, helping the club to win numerous titles both domestically and in Europe. He famously scored the winning goal in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final against Bayern Munich, cementing his place in United folklore.

However, Beckham's time at Manchester United was not without controversy. In 1998, he was sent off during a World Cup match against Argentina for kicking out at an opponent, which led to widespread criticism in the press. He also famously fell out with United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2003, leading to his departure from the club.

Real Madrid

In 2003, Beckham joined Spanish giants Real Madrid for a transfer fee of around $32 million. He spent four years at the club, helping them to win the La Liga title in 2007.

Beckham's time at Real Madrid was marked by both success on the pitch and drama off it. He famously clashed with teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, who was unhappy with the amount of attention that Beckham was receiving from the media.

LA Galaxy

In 2007, Beckham made the move to Major League Soccer (MLS) side LA Galaxy, in what was seen as a major coup for the league. He helped to raise the profile of soccer in the United States and became one of the most high-profile athletes in the country.

Beckham's time at LA Galaxy was again marked by both success and drama. He helped the club to win the MLS Cup in 2011 and 2012, but also had several high-profile incidents off the pitch. In 2011, he was fined $1,000 for confronting an opposing player on the field, and in 2013, he was involved in a heated exchange with a fan during a game.

Paris Saint-Germain

In 2013, Beckham joined French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on a five-month contract. He helped the club to win the Ligue 1 title and announced his retirement from professional soccer at the end of the season.

International Career

Beckham made his debut for the England national team in 1996 and went on to become one of the most capped players in the country's history. He famously scored a last-minute free-kick against Greece in 2001 to secure England's place in the 2002 World Cup.

Beckham's international career was not without controversy, however. He was sent off during the 1998 World Cup for a foul on Argentina's Diego Simeone, and famously missed a penalty kick in the quarterfinals of the 2004 European Championships against Portugal.

Off the Pitch

Beckham's impact extended far beyond the soccer pitch. He became a fashion icon in the mid-2000s, with his distinctive hairstyle and designer suits making him a regular fixture in the world's top fashion magazines.

Beckham also became a global ambassador for various causes, including UNICEF and the fight against malaria. He was awarded an OBE (Order of the British Empire) in 2003 for his services to soccer and was also awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award in 2008.

Family Life

Beckham married Spice Girl Victoria Beckham in 1999, and the couple have four children together. They have become one of the most famous celebrity couples in the world and have been the subject of countless media stories over the years.

Beckham's children have also followed in his footsteps to some extent. His eldest son, Brooklyn, has played soccer at various youth levels, and his second son, Romeo, is a model for luxury fashion brand Burberry.

Conclusion

David Beckham's impact on soccer and popular culture cannot be understated. With a career that spanned over two decades and took him to some of the world's biggest clubs, he became a global icon and helped to raise the profile of soccer in the United States. He also became a fashion icon and a global ambassador for various causes, cementing his place as one of the most recognizable and influential athletes of all time.",1

56,Search continues for missing Sherpas on Everest as Nepal gears up for new climbing season,"As Nepal's new climbing season draws near, search efforts continue for four missing Sherpas on Mount Everest. The Sherpas went missing in January after an avalanche swept through the region. The search has been hampered by poor weather conditions and the difficult terrain.

The Sherpas were part of a team responsible for fixing ropes and installing ladders for climbers attempting to summit Everest. Their disappearance has raised concerns about the safety of those who work on the mountain and highlighted the risks associated with climbing in the region.

Despite the challenges of the search, authorities have reiterated their commitment to finding the missing Sherpas. Teams of search and rescue personnel have been working around the clock, using helicopters and drones to scour the area. However, progress has been slow, and hopes of finding them alive are fading.

The situation has sparked debate about the responsibility of the climbing industry to ensure the safety of their workers. The Sherpas are an integral part of the industry's infrastructure, providing essential support to climbers attempting to summit the mountain. However, their welfare is often overlooked in favor of the commercial interests of the industry.

Nepal's government has sought to address these concerns by introducing new regulations aimed at improving working conditions for Sherpas. The regulations require climbing companies to provide better compensation, insurance, and equipment to their workers. However, there are concerns that the regulations will be difficult to enforce, given the widespread corruption in the industry.

The search for the missing Sherpas serves as a reminder of the risks and sacrifices associated with climbing the world's tallest peak. It is also a call to action for the industry to do more to ensure the safety and wellbeing of its workers. As Nepal gears up for another climbing season, it remains to be seen whether the lessons of the past will be heeded.",1
57,Yellen: 'Not anticipating a downturn' in the US economy,"The US economy has been experiencing a period of stability and growth, and this trend is expected to continue according to the former Chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen. Speaking at a conference in Washington, Yellen said she is ""not anticipating a downturn"" in the US economy.

Yellen believes that the US economy is currently in a very strong position, with low unemployment and high consumer confidence. She also praised the current leadership at the Federal Reserve, saying that they are doing a good job of managing the economy.

Despite this positive outlook, Yellen cautions that there are still risks to the US economy. One of the biggest risks is the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Yellen believes that this trade war could have a significant impact on the US economy, especially if it becomes more prolonged.

Yellen also expressed concern about rising levels of debt in the US, both at the government and individual levels. She called for greater fiscal responsibility from the government, and for individuals to be more cautious about taking on debt.

One area of the economy that Yellen is particularly bullish about is the tech sector. She believes that advances in technology are driving growth in the US economy, and that the tech sector will continue to be a major driver of growth in the years to come.

Yellen's comments come at a time when the US economy is enjoying a period of strong growth. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018, the fastest pace in nearly four years. Unemployment is also at historic lows, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.7% in September.

Despite these positive trends, there are still some concerns about the US economy. One of the biggest concerns is the trade war between the US and China. This trade war has already had an impact on the US economy, with some industries like agriculture suffering as a result of Chinese tariffs.

There are also concerns about rising levels of debt in the US. In August, the US government's debt surpassed $21 trillion for the first time, a record high. Some experts worry that this level of debt could have a negative impact on the US economy in the long term.

Despite these concerns, Yellen believes that the US economy will continue to grow and remain strong. She points to the strength of the US financial system and the efforts being made by the Federal Reserve to manage the economy effectively.

Yellen's comments also highlight the importance of fiscal responsibility and prudent economic policies. While the US economy is strong at present, it is important to maintain this strength by avoiding excessive debt and making smart choices about economic policy.

Overall, Yellen's comments are a welcome sign of confidence in the US economy. While there are still risks and challenges that must be addressed, Yellen's positive outlook is a testament to the strength and resilience of the US economic system.",1

60,Why you keep having the same dream,"Have you ever experienced a dream that keeps coming back to you, over and over again? Maybe it's a dream about falling, being chased, or standing naked in front of a crowd. Whatever the content may be, it can be alarming and leave you wondering why it's happening. You may even feel as though you're trapped in your own subconscious, unable to escape these recurring dreams.

If you've found yourself in this situation, rest assured that you're not alone. Recurring dreams are quite common and can happen to anyone at any age. In fact, studies show that about 60% of adults experience recurring dreams at some point in their lives.

So, what's behind these persistent dreams? Here are some possible explanations:

1. Unresolved Emotions or Trauma

If you're experiencing a recurring dream, it could be your mind's way of telling you that there are unresolved emotions or trauma that you haven't dealt with. Dreams often serve as a reflection of our inner world, and if there's something that's bothering you on a deep level, it may manifest in your dreams.

For example, if you recently went through a breakup, you may find yourself dreaming about your ex-partner repeatedly. Your mind may be processing the emotions and trying to make sense of what happened.

Similarly, if you experienced trauma in the past, such as abuse or a major loss, your dreams may reflect those events. Your mind may be trying to work through the trauma and find a way to heal.

2. Anxiety and Stress

Recurring dreams can also be a sign of anxiety and stress. If you're experiencing a lot of stress in your waking life, it may manifest in your dreams. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed at work, you may dream about missing deadlines or being unprepared for an important meeting.

Additionally, anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can also cause recurring dreams. If you're dealing with an anxiety disorder, it's important to speak with a mental health professional who can help you manage your symptoms.

3. Sleep Disorders

Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome can also cause recurring dreams. If you're not getting enough quality sleep, it can affect your dreams and cause them to be more vivid and memorable.

Furthermore, if you're waking up frequently throughout the night, you may be more likely to remember your dreams. This can create the illusion that you're having the same dream over and over again, when in reality you're having different dreams each time.

4. Symbolic Meaning

Finally, it's worth considering that your recurring dream may have symbolic meaning. Dreams often use symbols and metaphors to convey complex emotions and ideas. If you're having the same dream repeatedly, it may be worth examining the content for any underlying themes or symbols.

For example, if you're dreaming about being chased, it could represent a fear of something in your waking life that you're trying to escape. If you're standing naked in front of a crowd, it could represent a fear of vulnerability or embarrassment.

What Can I Do About Recurring Dreams?

If you're experiencing recurring dreams, there are several things you can do to manage them:

1. Keep a Dream Journal

Keeping a dream journal can help you track your dreams over time and identify any patterns. Write down as much detail as you can remember, including any emotions or symbols that stood out to you. By tracking your dreams, you may be able to identify any triggers that are causing them to recur.

2. Practice Relaxation Techniques

Practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing can help reduce stress and anxiety, which may be contributing to your recurring dreams. Additionally, practicing these techniques before bed can help you relax and improve the quality of your sleep.

3. Seek Professional Help

If you're experiencing recurring dreams that are causing you distress, it's important to speak with a mental health professional. They can help you identify any underlying issues and develop a treatment plan to manage them.

In Conclusion

Recurring dreams can be frustrating and leave you feeling trapped in your own subconscious. However, they're a common experience and have several potential explanations. By keeping a dream journal, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking professional help if necessary, you can manage your recurring dreams and find relief. Remember that your dreams are a reflection of your inner world, and by addressing any underlying issues, you can improve your overall well-being.",1

62,"'Beginning of the end' for fossil fuels: Global wind and solar reached record levels in 2022, study finds","A new study by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revealed that global wind and solar production has reached record levels in 2022. This breakthrough signals the 'beginning of the end' for fossil fuels.

The IEA's report shows that renewable energy has produced more electricity globally than coal and gas combined for the first time. This milestone is a major victory for clean energy advocates who have been pushing for more sustainable modes of energy production for years.

The amount of electricity generated from wind and solar rose by 8% in 2022, with renewables accounting for 28% of all electricity generated. In contrast, coal produced just 23.5% of electricity, down from 39% in 2014.

The IEA analysis pointed out that the accelerating momentum of renewables drive post-pandemic economic growth, industrial transformations, and job creation, ""as countries are not making adequate use of available clean energy sources to drive sustainable economic growth""

The report also highlights the benefits of renewable energy, such as decreasing carbon emissions, creating jobs, and helping reduce global warming.

""The extraordinary surge in wind and solar energy in 2022 sends a clear signal that their future is bright and vibrant,"" said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. ""Governments need to build on this momentum.""

Birol noted that even though wind and solar energy continue to increase, they will need to grow at a faster rate in order to achieve international climate goals, which involves reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.

With more technological advancements in the renewable energy sector, such as electric vehicles and energy storage, the world is becoming increasingly confident in a fossil-fuel-free future. It is becoming increasingly clear to investors that clean energy is the future.

Many countries around the world are already taking serious action to reduce their carbon emissions, including China, the world's largest emitter, which has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060. In the United States, President Biden has reversed many of his predecessor's efforts to roll back climate policies and is investing billions of dollars in renewable energy projects as part of his infrastructure plan.

As the world takes steps towards a greener future, it seems that the 'beginning of the end' for fossil fuels is becoming a reality. The IEA's report has demonstrated that the shift towards renewable energy is happening faster than anticipated, and it is time for governments and companies to invest more in the sector and capitalize on its many benefits.

As the world continues to move towards a greener future, the benefits of renewable energy will only grow more apparent, and it will soon be impossible to deny the superiority of clean, sustainable and efficient energy sources over traditional fossil fuels.",1
63,'Succession' writer reveals they used code words 'Larry David' to hide major plot development,"Fans of the HBO drama series 'Succession' have been left scratching their heads as to how the show's creator managed to keep a major plot development under wraps. However, in a recent interview, writer and showrunner Jesse Armstrong revealed the secret code words that were used to keep the secret safe.

Armstrong stated that he and the other writers referred to the top-secret plot point as ""Larry David"" in order to confuse anyone who might overhear their discussions. Apparently, the team chose 'Larry David' because it was a completely unrelated term that no one expected to hear in relation to the show.

It's unclear what the ""Larry David"" plot point entails, but fans are now even more intrigued, with speculation running wild online. It's an unsuspecting choice for a code word, but it seems to have done the trick, as no major details were leaked ahead of the season's finale.

This isn't the first time a hit show has employed such tactics to keep its secrets safe. The finale of Breaking Bad was kept secret by giving scripts to actors on an as-needed basis, and Game of Thrones famously filmed multiple endings to keep the ending a secret.

Whether or not this method of keeping secrets will become a trend, it certainly seems like an effective strategy for protecting major plot points. As for what ""Larry David"" means for the future of 'Succession', fans will just have to wait and see.",1
64,"April 12, 2023 Second ousted lawmaker headed back to Tennessee House","April 12, 2023 Second Ousted Lawmaker Headed Back to Tennessee House

By John Smith, CNN

A second ousted lawmaker is headed back to the Tennessee House. This marks a historic moment for the state, as it marks the first time in the history of Tennessee that a member has been restored to the House after being kicked out.

In 2020, a scandal rocked the state, as a handful of lawmakers were implicated in a corruption scheme that saw them accept illegal payments from lobbyists in exchange for favorable legislative treatment. The scheme was discovered during an FBI investigation, which led to the arrests and subsequent convictions of several lawmakers.

One of the lawmakers involved in the scheme was John Doe, a Republican representative from Tennessee's 24th district. Doe pleaded guilty to accepting illegal payments from lobbyists and was forced to resign from the House as a result.

However, Doe did not accept his fate and decided to fight back against his ouster. He hired a team of lawyers and launched a legal battle against the state, arguing that his removal from the House was unconstitutional.

Doe's argument was based on the fact that the Tennessee Constitution does not explicitly allow for the removal of a lawmaker from the House. Instead, the Constitution only allows for the expulsion of members from the Senate, which is a separate branch of the state legislature. Doe argued that the House did not have the power to remove him, and that he could only be expelled by the Senate.

The case quickly became a national controversy, as both sides dug in their heels and refused to back down. Supporters of Doe argued that he was being unfairly targeted, while opponents pointed out that his actions were illegal and warranted his removal from the House.

After months of legal wrangling, the Tennessee Supreme Court finally weighed in on the case. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that the House did not have the power to remove Doe from office, and that his expulsion was unconstitutional.

The ruling was a major victory for Doe, who immediately announced his intention to return to the House. However, he faced a major obstacle: the House leadership had no intention of allowing him to return.

The leadership argued that even though the Supreme Court had ruled against them, they had the right to uphold their own rules and procedures. They also argued that Doe's return would undermine the integrity of the House and create chaos within the legislative body.

Despite their protests, Doe pressed ahead with his campaign to return to the House. He took his case to the people, arguing that his removal was a violation of their democratic rights and that he had been unfairly targeted by the political establishment.

His campaign gained traction, and soon a groundswell of support was building behind him. Public opinion polls showed that a majority of Tennesseans believed that Doe should be allowed to return to the House, and many lawmakers began to change their minds about his case.

Finally, in a dramatic twist of events, Doe was officially reinstated to the House. The House leadership backed down from their stance and allowed him to take his seat once again.

The reinstatement of Doe was a historic moment for the state of Tennessee, and it marked a significant victory for the citizens of the state. It showed that even in the face of adversity, the people of Tennessee could succeed in upholding their democratic rights and holding their elected officials accountable.

However, the story did not end there. In early 2023, another ousted lawmaker, Jane Smith, announced that she too would be seeking reinstatement to the House.

Smith had been implicated in the same corruption scheme as Doe, and had been expelled from the House along with him. However, unlike Doe, Smith had never accepted her fate and had been fighting her expulsion ever since.

She argued that the expulsion of both her and Doe had been unconstitutional, and that they had both been punished without due process or a fair hearing. She also pointed out that the Tennessee Constitution did not explicitly allow for the expulsion of members from the House, and that the Supreme Court had already ruled on this matter in Doe's case.

Like Doe, Smith's case quickly became a national controversy. Supporters argued that she had been unfairly targeted and that her rights had been violated, while opponents pointed out that her actions had been illegal and that her expulsion was warranted.

The House leadership once again refused to back down, arguing that they had the right to enforce their own rules and procedures. They also pointed out that just because the Supreme Court had ruled against them in Doe's case, that did not mean that they had to accept every other expelled lawmaker back into the House.

The case went to court, where it remained for several months. Finally, in another landmark ruling, the Supreme Court once again weighed in on the issue.

This time, however, the court ruled against Smith. In a 5-4 decision, the court upheld the House's right to expel members and ruled that Smith's expulsion had been lawful and constitutional.

The decision was a major blow to Smith's campaign, and it seemed unlikely that she would be able to return to the House. However, she did not give up hope and vowed to continue fighting for her rights.

In the end, Smith's campaign did not succeed, and she was not reinstated to the House. However, her case, like Doe's before her, had highlighted the importance of proper legal procedure and the need for elected officials to be held accountable for their actions.

The reinstatement of Doe showed that even in the face of adversity, the people of Tennessee could succeed in upholding their democratic rights and holding their elected officials accountable. The case of Smith showed that sometimes, even if the cause is just, the legal system may ultimately rule against you.

However, the message is clear: in Tennessee, and in the United States as a whole, the people have the power to uphold their democratic rights and ensure that their elected officials are held accountable. The cases of both Doe and Smith serve as reminders of this fact, and will remain important moments in the history of Tennessee for many years to come.",1
65,Alzheimer's and HRT: Study suggests sweet spot to avoid dementia,"A new study has found that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may have a ""sweet spot"" for reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

The research, which was conducted by scientists from the University of Southern California and published in the journal Neurology, found that women who started taking HRT in their 50s had a significantly lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those who started taking HRT in their 60s.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the brain, causing memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. There is currently no cure for the disease, and treatments that are available can only manage symptoms.

HRT is commonly used to treat the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats. But in recent years, there has been controversy over the long-term use of HRT due to concerns that it may increase the risk of breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke.

The new study looked at data from more than 7,000 women who were part of the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS). The women were between the ages of 65 and 79 and had been randomly assigned to take either a combination of estrogen and progesterone or a placebo.

The researchers analyzed the data to determine whether there was a correlation between the age of the women when they started taking HRT and their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

They found that women who started taking HRT in their 50s had a 30% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those who started taking HRT in their 60s. This suggests that there may be a ""sweet spot"" for HRT use in terms of reducing the risk of the disease.

Dr. Pauline Maki, lead author of the study and a professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a press release that the findings were ""encouraging"" but more research is needed to confirm the results and to understand the mechanism behind the reduced risk.

""This study provides some reassurance that for women who take hormone therapy for symptomatic reasons at the time of menopause, there is a window of opportunity in their 50s for potential cognitive benefit,"" Dr. Maki said.

The study has important implications for the millions of women who experience menopause each year. While HRT is not suitable for everyone, it can be an effective option for women who are experiencing significant symptoms.

However, the decision to take HRT should be made on an individual basis and should take into account a woman's overall health and medical history, as well as her personal preferences.

Dr. Maki noted that the risks and benefits of HRT should be discussed with a healthcare provider to ensure that women are making an informed decision.

""Given the complexity of this topic, a woman's decision to use hormone therapy should be made in consultation with her healthcare provider, considering her individual risks and benefits, and preference,"" she said.

While the study provides some promising data about the potential benefits of HRT for reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease, more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and to confirm the results. 

The researchers also highlighted the need for more personalized approaches to managing menopause symptoms and reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

""We need to develop more personalized approaches to the management of menopausal symptoms and cognitive aging,"" Dr. Maki said. ""This may include the identification of specific subgroups of women who are more or less likely to benefit from hormone therapy, targeted non-pharmacological interventions, and more effective treatment of other risk factors for cognitive decline.""

Alzheimer's disease is a significant public health issue. It affects more than 5 million Americans and is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. It is estimated that the number of people living with Alzheimer's disease will triple by 2050.

While there is no cure for the disease, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and managing other medical conditions that may increase the risk.

The findings from the new study provide important information for women who are considering HRT as a treatment option for menopause symptoms. However, it is important to note that HRT is not a one-size-fits-all solution and should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of personalized approaches to healthcare, particularly when it comes to managing conditions such as menopause and Alzheimer's disease. As more research is conducted in this area, healthcare providers will be better equipped to offer tailored treatment options that meet the unique needs of individual patients.",1
66,Predictions about the decline of Christianity in America may be premature,"As America becomes increasingly secular and diverse, some experts have sounded the alarm that Christianity in the country is in decline. However, others argue that these predictions may be premature.

According to the Pew Research Center, the proportion of U.S. adults who identify as Christian declined from 78% in 2007 to 65% in 2019. Simultaneously, the share of the population who identify as religiously unaffiliated grew from 16% to 26% during the same period.

However, these numbers do not necessarily spell doom for Christianity in America. Here are some reasons why predictions about its decline may be premature.

1) Christianity remains the dominant religion in America

Despite the decline in the proportion of Americans who identify as Christian, it still remains the dominant religion in the country. Sixty-five percent of the population still identifies as Christian, an overwhelming majority compared to other religions.

2) Millennial and Generation Z members are still open to spirituality

Although younger generations are less likely to identify as religious, they remain open to spirituality. A study by the Barna Group found that more than half of millennials (59%) and Generation Z (53%) believe that God exists.

Furthermore, members of these generations are interested in exploring spirituality outside of organized religion. A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that 27% of younger adults identify as ""spiritual but not religious.""

3) Christianity is adapting to a changing America

Christianity in America is not a monolith; it encompasses a broad spectrum of beliefs and practices. Some Christian denominations are struggling, while others are thriving.

For example, evangelical Protestantism, which accounts for a significant proportion of U.S. Christians, is growing, according to the Pew Research Center. The number of evangelicals in the United States increased by 1 million people between 2007 and 2014.

Moreover, Christianity in America is adapting to a more diverse population by incorporating elements of different cultures and religions into its practices. Churches are incorporating more Spanish-language services, and African American churches are incorporating hip-hop music into their worship services.

4) Christianity still has a strong influence on American culture

Christianity has played a significant role in shaping American culture and values, and it continues to do so, even among people who do not identify as religious.

The idea of the ""Protestant work ethic,"" which emphasizes hard work, frugality, and personal responsibility, has had a lasting impact on American values. Additionally, Christian charities and organizations continue to be at the forefront of providing aid and assistance to those in need.

5) Christianity is expanding globally

While Christianity may be declining in America, it is expanding globally. A study by the Center for the Study of Global Christianity found that the number of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa grew from 7% of the population in 1900 to 63% in 2010.

Furthermore, Christianity is rapidly growing in Asia, including in China, where the number of Christians is expected to reach 250 million by 2030.

In conclusion, predictions about the decline of Christianity in America may be premature. Christianity remains the dominant religion in America, and younger generations are still open to spirituality. Moreover, Christianity is adapting to a changing America and remains a significant influence on American culture and values. Finally, Christianity is expanding globally, even if its growth in America may be stagnant.",1

68,How to avoid the next crisis? Banks may have to hold more cash,"As the world economy recovers from the pandemic, many are questioning how to avoid the next financial crisis. One solution that is gaining popularity is imposing stricter requirements for banks to hold more cash.

When banks lend money, they typically only hold a small percentage of the loan amount in cash, known as a reserve. The rest is invested or loaned out to other individuals or businesses. This practice, known as fractional reserve banking, can allow for greater economic growth as more money is put into circulation. However, it also leaves the banking system vulnerable to a collapse if too many loans are unable to be repaid.

The financial crisis of 2008 was caused in part by this very issue. Banks had issued too many loans to people who were unable to repay them, resulting in widespread defaults and foreclosures. Banks were left with massive losses and had to be bailed out by governments to prevent a complete economic collapse.

In response to this crisis, regulations were put in place to require banks to hold a minimum amount of cash reserves. The Basel III Accord, agreed upon by international regulators in 2010, requires banks to hold a minimum of 7% of their risk-weighted assets in Tier 1 capital, which includes cash reserves and other forms of high-quality capital.

However, some experts argue that these requirements are not strict enough to prevent another crisis. Banks still have the ability to lend out a significant amount more than they have in cash reserves, and many institutions have been found to be manipulating risk-weighted assets to appear more financially stable than they actually are.

While the 2008 crisis was caused by excessive lending to individuals and businesses, the next crisis could be caused by excessive lending to governments. Many countries have taken on massive amounts of debt in response to the pandemic, and if these debts become unsustainable, it could lead to a wave of defaults and economic instability.

In order to prevent another crisis, some are suggesting that banks need to be required to hold much higher levels of cash reserves. This would limit the amount of money that they could lend out, and reduce the risk of widespread defaults if too many loans go bad.

One study by the Bank of International Settlements found that if banks were required to hold 10% of their risk-weighted assets in Tier 1 capital, the probability of a banking crisis would be reduced by as much as 50%. Another study by the International Monetary Fund found that increasing capital requirements to 18% would result in a significant reduction in the likelihood of financial crises.

However, increasing capital requirements would have downsides as well. Banks would have to hold more cash reserves, reducing the amount of money that they could lend out. This could lead to slower economic growth, and potentially even recession. It could also make it more difficult for individuals and businesses to get loans, which could harm economic activity.

Additionally, requiring banks to hold higher levels of capital could lead to a smaller number of banks operating in the market. Smaller banks with fewer resources may not be able to meet the higher capital requirements, leading to a consolidation of the market and less competition.

Despite these downsides, many experts believe that increasing capital requirements is a necessary step to prevent another financial crisis. Governments are already providing significant amounts of support to individuals and businesses in response to the pandemic, and limiting the risk of a financial crisis could prevent the need for even more extensive government intervention in the future.

Additionally, some argue that the benefits of preventing a financial crisis outweigh the costs of slower economic growth and reduced competition. A financial crisis can have wide-reaching effects, including unemployment, lower income levels, and reduced access to credit for years to come.

Ultimately, whether or not banks will be required to hold more cash reserves remains to be seen. Some countries, such as Switzerland and Norway, have already implemented higher capital requirements than required by the Basel III Accord, while others have yet to follow suit. However, as the world economy continues to recover from the pandemic, the potential for another financial crisis remains a concern, and governments and regulators will need to consider all options to ensure stability in the banking system.",1
69,"Inflation hits the mailbox: Postage stamp prices are rising, again","Inflation hits the mailbox: Postage stamp prices are rising, again

The cost of sending a letter is set to increase once again. The United States Postal Service ( USPS) announced on Tuesday that it is raising the price of First-Class stamps from 55 cents to 58 cents come August 29, marking a 6% increase.

The latest postage stamp price increase represents a continuation of the rising trend seen over the last several years. The USPS called the hike “a result of extraordinary circumstances” brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The increase will see the agency raising its prices in response to rising costs such as fuel and transportation, as well as a decline in mail volume over the past year.

The USPS has seen a surge in package and parcel deliveries in recent years, thanks to a boom in e-commerce. However, it has also seen a decline in mail volume, given the rise of digital communications. More recently, the pandemic led to a sharp drop in postal revenues as business and consumer activity ground to a halt during nationwide lockdowns.

That being said, the latest increase may not be as substantial as some Americans had feared it would be. USPS had requested permission from regulators to raise prices by a whopping 10% or more, in order to make up for the pace of decline in mail volume over the past year.

Despite recent pressure, USPS has been looking to keep up with changing times while dealing with increased costs that it faces. The price of a First-Class stamp has been increasing over the years, with the most significant bump in 2019 when the price was raised to 55 cents. 

The USPS has emphasized that its largest cost driver is labor, which makes up more than 80% of its expenses. With mail volume continuing to decline, the agency has been pushing for operational reforms, which have come under public criticism given reports of mail delays in recent months.

This latest hike means that consumers are now set to pay more to send compact letters, large envelopes and small packages - yet another burden for those already feeling the pinch of rising inflation in the post-pandemic economy.",1
70,Congress moves to make xylazine a controlled substance,"Congress Moves to Make Xylazine a Controlled Substance

Washington D.C. - In a move that could have a significant impact on the drug trade, Congress is working on legislation that would make xylazine, a common drug used to sedate large animals such as horses, a controlled substance under federal law.

Xylazine is a powerful sedative used in veterinary medicine to calm horses and other animals before surgery or other procedures. However, the drug is increasingly used in the illegal drug trade as a cutting agent for cocaine and other illicit drugs.

The proposed legislation would make it illegal to possess or distribute xylazine without a prescription or license from the federal government. The drug would be classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance, which means it would be subject to stricter controls and penalties under federal law.

Under current law, xylazine is not classified as a controlled substance and is widely available for purchase from veterinary supply companies. However, law enforcement officials have reported an increase in the use of the drug in the illegal drug trade. Its sedative effects can intensify the effects of other drugs, making them more potent and dangerous.

Experts say that xylazine use has been on the rise in certain areas of the country, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. ""We've seen a significant increase in the use of xylazine as a cutting agent for cocaine and other drugs,"" said Jim McDonnell, the sheriff of Los Angeles County and the president of the Major County Sheriffs of America. ""It's a cheap and effective way to stretch the supply of drugs, but it can also be very dangerous.""

Xylazine use has been linked to a number of overdose deaths in recent years. In some cases, users have mistakenly believed they were taking pure cocaine or other drugs, only to find out later that the drugs had been cut with xylazine.

Law enforcement officials say that making xylazine a controlled substance would make it harder for drug dealers to obtain and use the drug. ""By making xylazine a controlled substance, we're sending a clear message that this drug is dangerous and has no place in the illegal drug trade,"" said Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA), who is sponsoring the legislation in the House of Representatives.

However, some critics of the legislation say that it could have unintended consequences, particularly for veterinarians and others who use xylazine for legitimate purposes. They say that the new restrictions could make it harder for veterinarians to obtain the drug, or could lead to higher costs for consumers.

""We're concerned that this legislation could have unintended consequences that could harm animal welfare and public health,"" said Dr. John Howe, the president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. ""We support efforts to address the misuse of drugs like xylazine, but we want to make sure that any new regulations don't harm the legitimate use of these drugs.""

Other critics of the legislation say that it doesn't go far enough to address the root causes of drug abuse, such as poverty, lack of education, and mental health issues. ""We need to focus on addressing the underlying factors that contribute to drug abuse, rather than simply cracking down on drugs like xylazine,"" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a vocal critic of the drug war.

Despite these concerns, the legislation has attracted bipartisan support in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties expressing concern about the growing use of xylazine in the illegal drug trade. ""We need to do everything we can to keep dangerous drugs off our streets,"" said Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), who is sponsoring the legislation in the Senate. ""This legislation will help us do that.""

If the legislation is passed, it would be a significant victory for law enforcement officials and advocates who have been working to combat the use of xylazine in the drug trade. ""Xylazine has become a scourge on our communities, and we need to do everything we can to stop its spread,"" said McDonnell.

However, the fight against drug abuse is far from over, and experts say that more needs to be done to address the root causes of drug abuse and addiction. ""We can't simply arrest our way out of this problem,"" said McDonnell. ""We need to focus on prevention, education, and treatment, so that people can get the help they need to overcome addiction and build a better life.""",1
71,Jury selection begins in historic Dominion defamation trial against Fox News,"Jury selection began on Monday in the highly-anticipated Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit against Fox News. The trial, which is set to take place in New York City, is being closely watched by media and legal experts alike as it is expected to have far-reaching consequences for media outlets and their reporting on election-related issues.

The Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News stems from the network's coverage of the 2020 US Presidential election, during which Fox News repeatedly aired baseless and false claims about Dominion's voting machines being used to rig the election in favor of President Joe Biden. Dominion Voting Systems, which provides election equipment and software to states across the United States, has vehemently denied these claims and filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News in February of this year.

This lawsuit marks a historic moment in the ongoing battle over disinformation and fake news in American media. The outcome of this trial will determine whether media outlets can continue to peddle falsehoods and propaganda in the guise of news reporting, or if they will be held accountable for their actions.

In his opening statement, Dominion's attorney Justin Nelson argued that Fox News knowingly spread misinformation about the company in order to boost ratings and cater to their audience's political biases. ""They didn't just report on the false allegations – they amplified them,"" Nelson said. ""They did so with reckless disregard for the truth and without regard for the consequences.""

Fox News has consistently defended their reporting on the 2020 election as accurate and balanced. The network's attorney, Scott Keller, argued in his own opening statement that Fox News was simply reporting on a news story that was of great public interest at the time. ""It is the responsibility of the press to report on issues of public concern, even if those issues are contentious or controversial,"" Keller said.

The trial is expected to last several weeks and include testimony from numerous witnesses, including Fox News executives and Dominion employees. Legal experts note that the outcome of this landmark case will have significant implications for the future of journalism and the media industry as a whole. If Dominion is successful in their lawsuit, it could result in major changes to the way that news outlets cover elections and other controversial topics.

The Dominion trial comes amid a wider conversation in the United States about the role of the media in shaping public opinion and the spread of disinformation. In recent years, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have faced growing scrutiny over their handling of false or misleading content, with many experts calling for increased regulation and accountability for these companies.

The case also comes on the heels of an historic election that saw record numbers of Americans voting by mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Trump campaign and its allies waged a months-long campaign to undermine the legitimacy of the election results, despite there being no evidence of widespread fraud or other irregularities. The Dominion lawsuit is just one piece of the ongoing fallout from this contentious election, and may provide some measure of justice for those who were falsely accused and maligned.

As the jury selection process continues, all eyes will be on the outcome of this groundbreaking case. The stakes are high for both Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News, as well as for the wider media industry and the American public. Whatever the outcome, this trial will undoubtedly shape the future of journalism and the role of the media in American society for years to come.",1

75,Warner Bros. Discovery reengineers the traditional TV bundle for the streaming era,"Warner Bros. Discovery has announced their plan to merge into a single global streaming giant that will reshape the entertainment industry. This move is aimed at challenging the dominant players in the industry – Netflix, Disney, and Amazon Prime – by reengineering the traditional TV bundle for the streaming era.

The merger, which will bring together Warner Bros.' studio, cable networks, and streaming services with Discovery's global footprint, is expected to be completed by mid-next year. The new company, which has not yet been named, will have a vast library of content, comprising of TV shows, movies, and documentaries, and will have access to over 200 million subscribers worldwide.

One of the significant changes that the new company plans to bring to the industry is the reengineering of the traditional TV bundle, which is a collection of programming channels sold as a single bundle to cable or satellite subscribers. The company plans to offer high-quality programming to viewers at a lower cost, thus avoiding large bundles of unpopular channels.

Speaking on the move, David Zaslav, the CEO of Discovery, said that the new company was going to offer a more affordable, more customizable, and more convenient way for viewers to access great content. ""The new company will give consumers more choice, more convenience, and more value than any other streaming service in the market,"" Zaslav said in a statement.

The merger comes at a time when the streaming industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with giants like Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime all vying for a share of the market. The new company will be looking to differentiate itself from its competitors by offering more unique programming and a larger variety of content. Additionally, by reengineering the traditional TV bundle, the company hopes to appeal to viewers who want more flexibility and control over their viewing experience.

The new company is expected to invest heavily in original programming, with a focus on high-quality shows, movies, and documentaries. The company aims to offer a diverse range of content, catering to viewers of all ages and interests. Additionally, the company plans to leverage the synergies between Warner Bros.' studio and Discovery's global production capabilities to produce more localized content that will appeal to viewers in different regions around the world.

In conclusion, the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery into a single global streaming giant has the potential to disrupt the entertainment industry. By reengineering the traditional TV bundle, the company hopes to offer viewers a more affordable, customizable, and convenient way to access great content. With a vast library of programming, a focus on original content, and a commitment to producing locally relevant content, the new company is set to challenge the dominance of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon Prime. It remains to be seen how the other players in the industry will respond to this new player, but it is clear that the streaming wars are far from over.",1

77,"Around 100 people killed after Myanmar junta attack on village, shadow government says","Myanmar has descended into chaos since the military coup in 2021, with the junta government cracking down on the people's peaceful protests, arresting and killing hundreds. The latest atrocity committed by the military occurred on Monday when around 100 people were killed in a village in Myanmar by junta forces, according to the shadow government, National Unity Government (NUG).

The village in question is called Kin Ma, and reports from the ground suggest that the junta raided it, killing men, women, and children. The villagers were defenseless and unarmed, making them easy targets for the ruthless military. The NUG has condemned the attack and has urged the international community to take action against the junta.

The use of force and violence against the people by the junta has gone on for too long, and it's time for the world to intervene before more innocent civilians are killed. The United Nations (UN) has already condemned the attack and has called for an immediate end to the violence.

However, condemnation is not enough, and immediate action is needed. The UN and international community must hold the junta accountable for these atrocities and put an end to the military regime in Myanmar.

The UN Security Council has been silent on this issue, and it's high time that they act, showing that they are committed to peace and justice. The international community must impose targeted sanctions against the junta and its supporters, including freezing their assets and imposing travel bans. The junta must be held accountable for the human rights abuses they have committed against the people of Myanmar.

The situation in Myanmar is worsening every day, and it's time for the world to wake up and take action to protect the people of Myanmar. The junta must be removed from power, and a democratic government must be established. The people of Myanmar deserve to live in peace and security, and they need our support to achieve that.

In conclusion, the attack on Kin Ma is a testament to the junta's disregard for human life and rights. The military regime must be held accountable for its actions, and the international community must act now before more innocent lives are lost.",1

79,"Gun violence in the US has become more lethal, research suggests","Gun violence has become more lethal in the United States, according to new research, which also revealed that firearm-related injuries are leading to greater numbers of hospitalizations and deaths.

A study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) last week, analyzed data from the National Inpatient Sample and found that the proportion of firearm injuries resulting in death rose from 28.7 percent in 2000 to 34.5 percent in 2016. This means that guns have become more deadly in the past two decades, leading to a greater loss of life after a shooting.

The study also found that the average age of gun injury victims rose from 32 to 34 years old over the same period. More men than women were hospitalized for gunshot wounds, with 86.6 percent of patients being male.

The data highlights the urgent need for greater gun control in the US, said Dr. Stephanie Bonne, lead author of the study and a trauma surgeon at Denver Health Medical Center.

“It’s time to have meaningful conversations about our gun laws, gun culture and how we can prevent firearm injuries and deaths,"" she said.

The US has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world, with an estimated 120 guns for every 100 people. This is despite the fact that the country has seen a rise in mass shootings in recent years, with more than 540 people being killed and 1,500 injured in such incidents in 2019 alone.

The issue has become increasingly politicized, with gun control advocates and opponents holding vastly different views on the matter. While some argue that more guns in the hands of responsible citizens would help stop mass shootings, others point to the success of countries like Australia, which effectively banned guns in the wake of a mass shooting in 1996 and has not seen a similar attack since.

Support for stronger gun laws in the US has grown in recent years, particularly in the wake of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed. However, progress has been slow, with Republicans and the National Rifle Association (NRA) opposing many proposed reforms.

The situation has been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a surge in gun sales across the country. Gun violence prevention advocates have expressed concern that the economic fallout from the pandemic, combined with increased gun ownership, could lead to a rise in shootings and deaths.

Some states have taken matters into their own hands, passing laws to restrict access to firearms or to ban certain types of guns. However, without federal reform, many experts predict that gun violence in the US will continue to be a major public health issue.

“Our findings suggest that firearm injuries are becoming deadlier over time,” said Dr. Bonne. “Without concerted efforts to prevent firearm injuries, the burden of morbidity and mortality will continue to escalate as will the cost to society.”

Gun violence is a complex issue, with multiple factors contributing to its prevalence in the US. However, studies like this one offer insights into the problem and underscore the urgent need for action to address it.

Until significant changes are made to gun laws and gun culture in the US, the country will continue to experience the tragic consequences of gun violence, with more lives lost and more families devastated by senseless shootings.",1

While it is typically diagnosed in individuals over the age of 50, recent studies have shown a significant increase in cases among younger adults. The American Cancer Society reports that the incidence of colorectal cancer has risen by 3% per year among adults under the age of 50 since the mid-1990s. This alarming trend raises the question – why is colorectal cancer on the rise among younger adults?

Experts believe that several factors may be contributing to the increase in colorectal cancer among young adults. A prime suspect is the Western diet, which is high in red meat, processed foods, and low in fruits and vegetables. Several studies have linked this type of diet to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Another factor is sedentary behavior, which has become more common in modern society. People who spend a significant amount of time sitting tend to be more insulin resistant, which can lead to inflammation and other health problems, including cancer.

Other potential risk factors for colorectal cancer in younger adults include obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and certain medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and type 2 diabetes. However, even after taking these factors into account, the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults cannot be fully explained.

One possible explanation is that there may be genetic changes occurring in younger adults that make them more susceptible to colorectal cancer. The cancer may also be developing differently in this population, with unique tumors and patterns of metastasis. Researchers are studying these differences to better understand the disease in younger adults.

Another possible explanation is that the screening guidelines for colorectal cancer have not caught up with this trend. Current guidelines recommend that individuals begin getting screened for colorectal cancer at age 50. However, many younger adults who develop the disease are not screened until they are symptomatic, which can delay diagnosis and treatment.

To address this issue, some organizations, including the American Cancer Society, are now recommending that screening begin at age 45 for individuals with an average risk of colorectal cancer. Those with a family history of the disease or other risk factors may need to start screening even earlier.

Colorectal cancer is a preventable disease in many cases. Screening can detect cancer at an early stage when it is treatable, and lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing the disease in the first place. Unfortunately, many younger adults are not aware of their risk and may not take preventative measures until it is too late.

The medical community is working to improve awareness of colorectal cancer among younger adults. Organizations such as Fight Colorectal Cancer, a nonprofit dedicated to education and advocacy, are working to educate the public about the disease and to encourage young adults to take steps to reduce their risk.

Researchers are also exploring new treatments and screening methods to improve outcomes for younger adults with colorectal cancer. One promising approach is immunotherapy, which trains the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Another is liquid biopsy, which involves testing a patient's blood for signs of cancer, rather than relying on traditional biopsies.

More research is needed to fully understand why colorectal cancer is on the rise among younger adults, but the good news is that there are steps individuals can take to reduce their risk. These include maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle, getting regular exercise, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, and getting screened for colorectal cancer according to current guidelines.

The increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults is a concerning trend, but with increased awareness and prevention efforts, it is possible to combat the disease and improve outcomes for those affected. As the medical community continues to study this issue, it is important for individuals to take their health into their own hands and make lifestyle changes that can reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer.",1

84,What is El Niño?,"El Niño is a complex phenomenon that significantly affects weather patterns across the globe. It is a recurring event that typically occurs every few years, leading to extreme weather conditions in various regions, including floods, droughts, and wildfires.

What is all about?
The term ""El Niño"" refers to the large-scale warming of the Pacific Ocean that often takes place near the equator. Specifically, it involves the warming of the waters in the central and eastern Pacific, which impacts the ocean-atmosphere system across the entire planet.

During an El Niño event, the trade winds that typically blow from east to west across the Pacific weaken, and in some cases, even reverse direction. This leads to a warm-water pool off the coast of South America that can spread westward and modify weather patterns worldwide.

Why is it Important?
El Niño can have significant impacts on global weather patterns, leading to severe storms, prolonged droughts, and other extreme weather events. These changes in weather conditions can significantly affect agriculture, fishing, economies, and even political stability in some regions.

For example, during an El Niño event, some regions may experience higher temperatures and less rainfall, leading to droughts that can damage crops and result in food shortages. Meanwhile, other regions may face more intense rainfall, leading to floods and landslides that can cause significant damage to infrastructure and lead to loss of life.

El Niño can also lead to changes in ocean currents and the patterns of marine life, impacting fishing and other ocean-based industries.

What causes El Niño?
While the exact cause of El Niño is not entirely understood, scientists believe that it is driven by a complex interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere. Specifically, scientists believe that changes in the trade winds that blow across the Pacific, coupled with changes in ocean currents, can lead to the warming of the water in the central and eastern Pacific.

In some cases, El Niño events may be triggered by natural fluctuations in the climate, while in other cases, they may be influenced by human activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions.

What are the effects of El Niño?

El Niño events can have a wide range of effects, depending on where they occur and how severe they are. Some of the most common effects of El Niño include:

1. Droughts: El Niño can lead to reduced rainfall in some regions, leading to drought conditions that can damage crops and lead to water shortages.

2. Floods: In other regions, El Niño can lead to heavy rainfall and flooding, causing damage to infrastructure and leading to loss of life.

3. Forest fires: El Niño can also contribute to forest fires in some regions, particularly in areas that are already experiencing dry weather conditions.

4. Extremes of heat and cold: El Niño can lead to higher temperatures in some regions and lower temperatures in others, depending on how it impacts local weather patterns.

5. Changes in marine life: El Niño can lead to changes in ocean currents and water temperatures, impacting the patterns of marine life and potentially leading to changes in fishing and other ocean-based industries.

What can we do about El Niño?

While El Niño is a natural phenomenon that cannot be prevented, there are steps that individuals and governments can take to mitigate its impacts. For example, governments can invest in early warning systems and other disaster management measures to prepare for extreme weather events.

Individuals can also take steps to reduce their carbon emissions, as human activities such as burning fossil fuels contribute to climate change, making El Niño events more likely and potentially more severe.

Ultimately, the impacts of El Niño illustrate the need for global cooperation and action to address climate change and prepare for extreme weather events. By taking steps to reduce our impact on the planet and prepare for the effects of natural events like El Niño, we can help ensure a more stable and resilient future for ourselves and future generations.",1

87,Ariana Grande says commenting on others' appearances is not OK: 'Be gentle with each other',"Singer Ariana Grande recently took to social media to share an important message with her fans: commenting on others' appearances is not OK.

In a since-deleted Instagram post, Grande wrote, ""I know some of y'all are curious about how I look now, but that's really not my focus. I'm a performer and my body is part of my job. But that doesn't mean I'm not human. So please, don't comment on anyone's body or appearance. Be gentle with each other.""

This message carries particular weight given Grande's reputation for being a strong advocate for body positivity and mental health. In the past, she has been open about her struggles with anxiety and has spoken out against societal beauty standards.

Grande's message also comes at a time when the issue of body shaming has become more prevalent than ever. With social media platforms like Instagram often highlighting unrealistic beauty standards, it can be easy to feel insecure about one's appearance. In extreme cases, this can lead to eating disorders or other mental health issues.

Grande's message is a reminder to all of us that we need to be kinder and gentler with each other. Instead of commenting on someone's appearance, we should focus on their talents, personality, and character. By doing this, we can help create a world where people feel valued for who they are, rather than how they look.

Grande's post also serves as an important call to action for social media platforms themselves. Many companies have taken steps to address cyberbullying and other forms of online harassment, but more needs to be done. By creating safe and positive spaces on the internet, we can help promote positive self-image and prevent the harmful effects of body shaming.

In conclusion, Ariana Grande's message about commenting on others' appearances is a timely and important one. It serves as a reminder that our words have power, and that we need to be gentle and kind with each other. We should focus on celebrating people's talents and personalities, rather than tearing them down based on their looks. By doing this, we can create a more positive and supportive world for everyone.",1
88,Nashville sends Justin Jones back to the Tennessee House days after GOP lawmakers ousted him,"In a surprising turn of events, Justin Jones, a Democrat from Nashville, has returned to the Tennessee House of Representatives just days after being ousted by Republican lawmakers.

Jones, who was initially elected in 2018, has been a vocal advocate for social justice and police reform. He made headlines earlier this year for his efforts to remove a bust of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from the Tennessee State Capitol Building. Jones was also arrested last year for protesting at a voting rights rally.

However, last week, the Republican-controlled House voted to remove Jones from his position, citing his disruptive behavior and refusal to adhere to House rules. Republicans argued that Jones had repeatedly disrupted proceedings and had engaged in conduct unbecoming of an elected official.

The move to oust Jones drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups, who argued that Republicans were targeting Jones because of his outspokenness on issues related to race and police brutality.

But just days after being removed from his position, Jones is back in the Tennessee House, thanks to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Tennessee.

The ACLU argued that Jones’ removal violated his constitutional rights to free speech and due process. In a ruling on Monday, a Davidson County Chancery Court judge ordered that Jones be reinstated and that the House’s action be nullified.

""Now that the court has found in my favor, I'm excited to get back to work fighting for my constituents,"" Jones said in a statement. ""I believe that this fight was about much more than just me. It was about standing up for the rights of all Tennesseans, and making sure that our democracy is protected.""

The decision has been hailed as a victory for free speech and civil rights advocates, who have expressed concern that lawmakers were trying to silence dissenting voices.

""This is an important victory for the First Amendment and for the citizens of Tennessee,"" Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the ACLU of Tennessee, said in a statement. ""The court recognized that Rep. Jones' right to free speech was violated, and that the House's attempt to remove him was unconstitutional.""

But Republicans have criticized the ruling, arguing that it sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to lawmakers being unable to enforce rules in the House.

""We disagree with the decision, and we believe that it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the separation of powers,"" said House Speaker Cameron Sexton in a statement. ""We have rules and procedures that are in place to ensure that the House functions effectively, and this decision undermines that.""

The ruling has also sparked debate about the power of lawmakers to remove elected officials, and whether the process is fair and transparent.

Under Tennessee law, lawmakers can be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of their respective House or Senate. However, the process has been criticized for being opaque and potentially subject to political manipulation.

""This is a reminder that when the Legislature removes a member, it must follow due process and respect the constitutional rights of the member being removed,"" said Andrew Sherfy, a constitutional law expert and professor at Vanderbilt Law School.

The situation with Jones has also highlighted the deepening political divide in Tennessee and across the country. Republicans and Democrats have become increasingly polarized, with little room for compromise or cooperation.

Democrats argue that Republicans are pushing an extreme agenda that undermines democracy and civil rights, while Republicans argue that Democrats are out of touch with the concerns of average Americans and are too focused on liberal social issues.

""The situation with Justin Jones is just another example of how divided and contentious our politics have become,"" said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. ""We're seeing this kind of polarization across the country, and it's not clear how we can bridge the gap and come together as a nation.""

The situation with Jones is likely to continue to play out in the coming weeks and months, as lawmakers and civil rights groups push for reform and greater transparency in the legislative process.

But for Jones, the focus is on getting back to work and fighting for his constituents.

""I'm grateful for the support of the ACLU and all those who stood with me during this difficult time,"" he said. ""I'm eager to get back to work on the issues that matter most to the people of Nashville and Tennessee, and to continue fighting for justice and equality.""",1

90,Jessica Lynch Fast Facts,"Jessica Lynch Fast Facts

Jessica Dawn Lynch was a Private First Class (PFC) in the United States Army, who rose to fame after she was captured during the Iraq War in 2003. Lynch's story drew international media attention, and her eventual rescue by U.S. Special Forces became the subject of scrutiny and controversy.

Here are some fast facts about Jessica Lynch:

Early Life and Military Service
Jessica Lynch was born on April 26, 1983, in Palestine, West Virginia. She grew up in a small community in Wirt County, where she attended Wirt County High School. Lynch was a member of the National Honor Society and participated in various sports, including basketball, softball, and track.

Lynch joined the U.S. Army in 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks. She completed basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and was trained as a unit supply specialist at Fort Lee, Virginia.

Capture and Rescue
In March 2003, Lynch was serving with the 507th Maintenance Company in Iraq when her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces near the town of Nasiriyah. Lynch suffered multiple injuries and was taken prisoner by Iraqi forces.

For nine days, Lynch was held captive in an Iraqi hospital. During that time, U.S. intelligence services received reports about her capture and began planning a rescue mission.

On April 1, 2003, U.S. Special Forces were able to locate and extract Lynch from the hospital. The operation involved a convoy of U.S. military vehicles, helicopters, and ground troops, and the rescuers were met with resistance from Iraqi forces.

Controversy and Aftermath
After her rescue, Lynch was hailed as a hero by the U.S. government and media, and several books were written about her experience. However, reports soon emerged that Lynch had not been the ""Rambo-esque"" warrior that some had imagined. In fact, she had been seriously injured during the ambush and was unable to fight back. Additionally, some questioned whether the U.S. military had exaggerated the danger of the rescue mission.

Lynch later wrote a book, ""I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story,"" which offered her own account of her capture and rescue. In the book, she described the physical and emotional trauma she suffered during her time in captivity and her difficulties in readjusting to civilian life after her release.

In 2007, Lynch was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army, and later earned a degree in elementary education from West Virginia University. She worked as a teacher for several years before returning to school to earn a master's degree in communications.

Throughout her life, Lynch has continued to speak out about her experience in Iraq and the challenges that veterans face after returning home. She has also advocated for better healthcare and support for military service members and their families.

In conclusion, Jessica Lynch's story is a reminder of the sacrifices that U.S. service members make every day, and the challenges that they and their families face as a result. As Lynch herself has said, ""I don't consider myself a hero. The heroes are the ones who gave their lives for their country.""",1
91,"Did this winter solve the Colorado River crisis? No -- but it took some pressure off, for now","The Colorado River is an essential source of water for Western states, providing irrigation for crops and drinking water for millions of people. However, the river has been in crisis for years, with drought and overuse causing water levels to drop dangerously low. This winter brought some much-needed relief in the form of snow and rain, but experts caution that it was not enough to solve the problem for good.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the Colorado River Basin is still facing a long-term drought, with demand for water outpacing supply. The winter snowpack in the Rocky Mountains is a key indicator of how much water the river will receive each year, and this year's snowpack was only slightly above average. While this is an improvement from last year's historically low levels, it is not enough to make up for the ongoing drought.

""Even if we had a fantastic winter every year, it's not enough to replenish the groundwater that's been lost over decades of pumping,"" says John Fleck, director of the Water Resources Program at the University of New Mexico.

The Colorado River Basin covers seven states, including California, Arizona, and Nevada, as well as parts of Mexico. These areas rely on the river for irrigation, hydroelectric power, and drinking water, but water levels have been steadily declining for years.

Experts predict that the Colorado River will face a supply-demand gap of around 3.2 million acre-feet by 2060, which is equivalent to the annual water use of nearly 7 million households. This shortfall could have dire consequences for the region, affecting agriculture, energy production, and daily life.

""Water is the limiting factor for growth in the West,"" says Brad Udall, a senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University. ""We're going to have to rethink how we use water and where we get it from.""

Despite the ongoing crisis, the winter snowpack provided some much-needed relief. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Rockies received an average of 110% of their normal snowpack this winter. This extra snow turned into extra water running into the Colorado River.

""For at least one year, we're not going to have a crisis,"" says Eric Kuhn, former general manager of the Colorado River Water Conservation District. ""But we're still in an overuse situation.""

The increased snowpack also allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to release more water from Lake Powell and Lake Mead, two major reservoirs that store water for the lower Colorado River basin. This extra water helped boost water levels in both lakes, which had dropped dangerously low in recent years.

However, experts caution that this boost is only temporary. While this winter's snowpack helped ease some of the pressure on the river, it did not solve the underlying problem of overuse and drought.

""We can't count on a good year like this every year, and we can't keep taking more water out of the river than is coming in,"" says Cody Ferguson, Western Water Program Manager for the Environmental Defense Fund.

Ferguson and other experts argue that the region needs to address the root causes of the water crisis, including overuse and outdated laws that govern water allocation. One potential solution is a system of water markets, where users can buy and sell water rights. This could help incentivize conservation and allow for more flexible allocation of water.

""We need to be more innovative and creative about how we manage water in the West,"" says Ferguson. ""We can't keep doing things the same way we've been doing them for the past century.""

Another potential solution is to focus on conservation and efficiency measures, such as using drought-resistant crops and upgrading irrigation systems to reduce water waste. Experts say that these measures can make a big difference in reducing water use, without requiring major changes to the way water is allocated.

""We need to be smarter about how we use water,"" says Fleck. ""We need to move beyond the mindset of just using more and more each year, and focus on using what we have more efficiently.""

The Colorado River crisis is an urgent problem that requires immediate action, but experts say that there is reason for hope. The heightened awareness of the issue has led to increased innovation and cooperation among stakeholders, as well as a growing sense of urgency to address the problem.

""We know what we need to do to solve this problem,"" says Udall. ""We just need the political will to do it.""

As Western states continue to grapple with the Colorado River crisis, it is clear that this winter's snowpack was a welcome relief. But it was only a temporary respite, and the region must take significant steps to address the underlying causes of the problem if it hopes to have a sustainable water supply in the years ahead.",1
92,Matthew McConaughey says he and Woody Harrelson might be brothers,"Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson have been longtime friends and collaborators, having starred together in the acclaimed HBO series True Detective. But now, McConaughey has thrown a curveball into their relationship by suggesting that they might actually be brothers.

During a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, McConaughey spoke about a book he is currently writing, in which he details his experiences in Hollywood and his relationships with other celebrities. When the topic of Harrelson came up, McConaughey dropped a bombshell.

""I found out that before my mother met my father, she had a fling with a guy named Charles Harrelson,"" McConaughey said, referring to Woody's late father who was notorious for his involvement in organized crime and was eventually convicted of murder. ""So, I'm wondering…could Woody and I actually be brothers?""

Fallon seemed taken aback by the revelation, and McConaughey went on to explain that he has been doing some research on genealogy to try and get to the bottom of the mystery. He jokingly added that he and Harrelson may even have a spin-off series in the works, in the vein of True Detective, but with a familial twist.

While McConaughey's comments were mostly in jest, they have sparked an interesting conversation among fans and the media about the concept of found family and the ways in which relationships can transcend blood ties.

Many have pointed out that McConaughey and Harrelson do share some similarities in their appearance and acting style, and their on-screen chemistry is often hailed as one of the strongest aspects of True Detective. However, others are skeptical about the idea that the two could actually be related, and have called for more concrete evidence before drawing any conclusions.

Either way, McConaughey's suggestion has added a new layer of intrigue to his friendship with Harrelson, and has once again thrust the actor into the spotlight. McConaughey has been making headlines recently for a number of reasons, including his potential gubernatorial bid in his home state of Texas and his upcoming role in the highly anticipated movie adaptation of the video game franchise, Uncharted.

As for the question of whether or not McConaughey and Harrelson are secretly siblings, only time will tell. But one thing is for sure – the bond between the two actors is undeniable, whether it's rooted in blood or not.",1
93,Who says romance is dead? Couples are using ChatGPT to write their wedding vows,"For years, we have been told that romance is dead, that it is a relic of the past, lost in the hustle and bustle of our modern-day lives. But with a growing number of couples turning to ChatGPT, an online platform that allows users to connect and share their thoughts and experiences, it seems that romance is alive and well.

More and more, couples are using ChatGPT to write their wedding vows. Whether they are looking to express their love for each other in a unique way, or simply want to ensure that their vows are heartfelt and authentic, ChatGPT provides the perfect platform for couples to share their feelings with one another.

One of the great things about ChatGPT is that it is a completely private platform. Couples can use it to communicate with each other without anyone else being able to see what they are saying. This means that they can be completely honest and open with one another, sharing their deepest thoughts and feelings without fear of judgement.

Another great feature of ChatGPT is that it is incredibly easy to use. Even those who are not particularly tech-savvy can quickly learn how to use the platform, allowing them to focus on what really matters – expressing their love for one another.

But why are couples turning to ChatGPT to write their wedding vows? For many, it is simply a way to ensure that their vows are truly unique. Traditionally, wedding vows tend to follow a similar format – promising to love, honor and cherish one another until death do us part. While there is nothing wrong with this format, it can be a little uninspiring for some couples.

By using ChatGPT, couples can break away from the traditional format and create vows that are completely unique to them. Whether they want to incorporate personal anecdotes, reference their favorite song lyrics or simply express their love in their own words, ChatGPT allows them to do so.

For others, writing their vows on ChatGPT is a way to ensure that they are truly heartfelt and sincere. While many couples opt for pre-written vows, there can sometimes be a sense that they are not as authentic as they could be. By writing their vows on ChatGPT, couples can take the time to really think about what they want to say to one another, and craft vows that truly come from the heart.

Of course, this is not to say that writing your vows on ChatGPT is for everyone. For some couples, the traditional format of wedding vows is perfect, and there is no need to deviate from it. But for those who want to ensure that their vows are truly unique and heartfelt, ChatGPT can provide the perfect platform.

If you are considering writing your wedding vows on ChatGPT, here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Take the time to really think about what you want to say to your partner. Consider what you love about them, what they mean to you, and what you hope for your future together.

2. Don't worry too much about getting everything perfect. The beauty of ChatGPT is that you can edit and revise your vows until you are completely happy with them.

3. Be yourself. Your partner loves you for who you are, so don't feel like you have to be someone else when you are writing your vows.

4. Incorporate personal anecdotes or references that are meaningful to the two of you. Whether it's a line from your favorite movie, or a story about how you first met, these personal touches can make your vows even more special.

5. Don't forget to include the traditional vows if that's something that's important to you. You can still make your vows unique while incorporating the traditional format.

While some may argue that romance is dead, the growing trend of couples using ChatGPT to write their wedding vows suggests otherwise. By providing a private, easy-to-use platform, ChatGPT is helping couples express their love for one another in unique and authentic ways. Whether you're a tech-savvy couple or a traditionalist at heart, there's no denying that ChatGPT is changing the way we think about wedding vows – and perhaps even romance itself.",1

The victims of the shooting have been identified as James Grimes, 57, Kaitlyn Robb, 25, and Timothy Hester, 20. Two other people were injured in the shooting and are being treated at a local hospital.

The shooting is just the latest in a string of mass shootings that have rocked the United States in recent years. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 251 mass shootings in the United States in 2019 alone. Mass shootings, which are defined as incidents where four or more people are shot, have become increasingly common in the country, prompting calls for stricter gun control laws.

""Once again, we are forced to confront the terrible toll that gun violence is taking on our communities,"" Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said in a statement. ""We must do more to keep our citizens safe, and we must do it now.""

In the wake of the shooting, officials have increased security measures in downtown Louisville. The area around the bank has been cordoned off, and police are asking citizens to avoid the area.

The bank where the shooting took place has also released a statement, offering condolences to the victims' families and expressing shock and disbelief at the incident.

""We are heartbroken by the senseless act of violence that occurred at our branch today,"" the statement read. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives, and we are doing everything we can to provide support and assistance to those affected by this tragedy.""

The shooting has left many citizens of Louisville shaken and afraid. In the aftermath of the incident, there have been calls for increased security measures and for solutions to the problem of gun violence in the country.

""It's a terrible thing that happened, and it's scary to think that it could happen anywhere,"" Louisville resident Samantha Myers said. ""We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. We need to do whatever it takes to keep our communities safe.""

In the coming weeks and months, officials will be working to determine how the shooting took place and what could have been done to prevent it. The incident is likely to spark renewed debate about gun control and the need for stricter laws to prevent further tragedies.

Ultimately, however, the focus must remain on the victims of the shooting and on their families who are coping with the tragic loss of their loved ones. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time.",1

100,"WHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk","The World Health Organization (WHO) has revised their advice on the Covid-19 vaccine, stating that healthy children and teens are at a low risk for the virus and may not require the vaccine. This new recommendation has been met with mixed reactions, but many pediatricians and parents are relieved.

Since the emergence of the pandemic in late 2019, there has been a great deal of concern about the effects of Covid-19 on children. Early on, it was unclear whether kids were at a greater risk for severe illness or death from the virus. However, as more data has been gathered and analyzed, it has become evident that most healthy children and teenagers are at a relatively low risk.

The WHO's new recommendation states that healthy children and teens may not need to be vaccinated, at least not right away. The organization has urged countries to prioritize the vaccination of high-risk individuals, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, before vaccinating young people.

While there has been concern about the new Delta variant and its potential impact on children, the WHO notes that the same safety measures that protect adults will also protect kids. Social distancing, mask-wearing, and frequent hand-washing are all effective ways of preventing the spread of the virus and reducing the risk of infection.

Some experts have questioned the WHO's recommendation, arguing that vaccinating children is crucial in achieving herd immunity and fully controlling the pandemic. However, others have welcomed the news, stating that vaccination should only be given to those who are most at risk.

Pediatricians across the country have expressed relief at the new advice, noting that the risk to most healthy children and teenagers is relatively low. They have emphasized the importance of continuing to implement safety measures and closely monitoring children for any signs of illness. However, they also caution that children with underlying health conditions may still be at higher risk and should be vaccinated as soon as possible.

Parents have also expressed mixed reactions to the new guidance. Some have welcomed the news, stating that they feel more comfortable waiting to vaccinate their children. Others have expressed concern, wondering when it will be safe for their kids to return to normal activities and when they will be able to resume normal activities like school and sports.

Ultimately, the decision about whether to vaccinate children will be a personal one, with parents and guardians weighing the risks and benefits of the vaccine. However, it is important to note that vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials, and they are an important tool in reducing the spread of the virus and ending the pandemic.

As more information becomes available and more people are vaccinated, experts will continue to evaluate the risks and benefits of the vaccine in different populations, including children. For now, the WHO is urging caution and prioritizing those who are most at risk.

The Covid-19 pandemic has been a challenging time for families across the globe, particularly for those with young children. While the new recommendations may be met with mixed reactions, they serve as a reminder that we must continue to take the necessary precautions to protect ourselves and others while we work to control this virus.",1
101,"Coolio's death caused by accidental overdose, according to coroner","The coroner's office in Los Angeles has confirmed that rapper Coolio's death was caused by an accidental overdose. The 58-year-old musician was found dead in his home on Thursday, and speculation had been rife about the cause of his passing.

According to the coroner, Coolio died as a result of a mix of prescription drugs, and the levels in his system were high enough to cause his death. The exact combination of drugs has not been revealed, but the coroner's office has stated that they were all legally prescribed.

Coolio, whose real name was Artis Leon Ivey Jr., was best known for his hit songs ""Gangsta's Paradise"" and ""Fantastic Voyage."" He had been living in California for many years and had a successful career as a rapper and actor.

His death has come as a shock to his fans and the music community as a whole. Many have taken to social media to express their condolences and pay tribute to the rapper.

In recent years, Coolio had spoken publicly about his struggles with addiction and had sought help for his issues. It is not clear at this time whether he had relapsed before his death or whether the drugs involved were prescribed for legitimate medical reasons.

The music world has lost a talented artist and our thoughts are with Coolio's family and friends during this difficult time. His music will continue to live on and inspire fans around the globe.",1
102,A little-known drug brought billions to Syria's coffers. Now it's a bargaining chip,"Syria has long been the subject of geopolitical tension, wracked by conflict and economic hardship. Yet amidst this chaos, there is a surprising source of revenue that has helped prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad: captagon.

Captagon is a synthetic drug originally invented in the 1960s as a treatment for hyperactivity and narcolepsy. But over the years, it has become increasingly associated with illicit drug use, particularly in the Middle East. The drug is known for its stimulant properties, providing users with a burst of energy, heightened alertness, and a sense of euphoria. It is believed to be popular among fighters on both sides of the Syrian conflict, as well as recreational users.

For Syria, however, captagon has become more than just a drug of choice. It has become a vital export, generating billions of dollars in revenue for the government. According to a report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Syrian production of captagon increased 10-fold between 2006 and 2013, making it the world's largest producer of the drug. The report estimates that the street value of captagon produced in Syria could be as high as $4.5 billion per year.

The Syrian government has been accused of playing an active role in the production and distribution of captagon, using it as a tool to fund its military and security apparatus. In a 2014 interview with The Guardian, a former Syrian army general claimed that captagon had become a ""weapon"" used by the government to keep its troops alert and aggressive. He alleged that factories producing the drug were located on military bases and that the government was directly involved in their operation.

The government has denied any connection to the production or trafficking of captagon, calling such allegations ""a figment of the imagination."" But the evidence suggests otherwise. In 2015, Lebanese authorities seized over two tons of captagon pills that were believed to have been manufactured in Syria. The drugs were hidden in a shipment of pomegranate juice bound for Saudi Arabia.

More recently, there have been reports that captagon production in Syria has decreased significantly due to the ongoing conflict. The government has lost control of certain areas where factories producing the drug were once located, and rival armed groups are believed to be fighting over control of the remaining facilities. This has led to a shortage of the drug in the region and a surge in prices.

But while captagon may no longer be the cash cow it once was for the Syrian government, it still holds significant value as a bargaining chip. In December 2017, French authorities arrested two men in the southern city of Marseille who were in possession of a shipment of captagon pills. The pills were believed to have been produced in Syria and were en route to Saudi Arabia.

The men, who were Lebanese nationals, claimed that they had been hired by a Syrian businessman to transport the drugs. The businessman was later identified as Mohamad al-Chaar, a wealthy Syrian who has been linked to the government of Bashar al-Assad. Al-Chaar was arrested in Switzerland in January of this year and faces extradition to France.

The case has shed new light on the role of captagon in Syria's economy and its connection to the government. Some experts believe that al-Chaar's arrest could be a sign of growing pressure on the Assad regime to end the conflict and engage in meaningful negotiations. The government has long been accused of using the conflict as a tool to maintain its grip on power, and the international community has imposed economic sanctions on the country as a result.

Captagon could provide a perfect opening for dialogue. If the government were to agree to crack down on captagon production and trafficking, it could show a willingness to take steps to address the country's drug problem and signal a commitment to the rule of law. It could also help to ease tensions with neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, which have been impacted by the cross-border flow of illicit drugs.

Of course, this is easier said than done. Captagon production in Syria is deeply entrenched, and the government has shown little interest in cracking down on the industry. The drug is seen as a vital source of revenue, and many of the factories producing it are located in areas that are difficult to access or control.

Moreover, even if the government were to agree to take action, there are fears that it could simply drive the industry underground or push it into the hands of criminal gangs. Without a comprehensive strategy that addresses the root causes of drug production and trafficking in Syria, any efforts to curb the flow of captagon could ultimately be counterproductive.

Nonetheless, the case of Mohamad al-Chaar and the seizure of the captagon shipment in Marseille highlight the potential role of the drug as a bargaining chip in negotiations over Syria's future. As the conflict drags on, with no clear end in sight, it may take unconventional approaches to find a path to peace. Captagon, strange as it may seem, could be part of that equation.",1

107,Contract negotiations between Rutgers University and 3 unions representing thousands of faculty and staff continue amid historic strike,"After weeks of tense negotiations, contract talks between Rutgers University and three unions representing thousands of faculty and staff continue, even as a historic strike looms over the campus.

The Communication Workers of America (CWA), the Union of Rutgers Administrators-American Federation of Teachers (URA-AFT), and the Rutgers AAUP-AFT, which represent more than 20,000 faculty and staff at Rutgers University, have been locked in contract negotiations with the university since last year. 

The unions have been pushing for better wages, benefits, and job security, among other demands. Over the past several weeks, they have intensified their efforts, staging several rallies and protests outside university buildings.

Now, as the stalemate continues, the unions have voted to authorize a strike. If carried out, it would be the first faculty and staff strike in Rutgers' 253-year history.

The university administration has warned that a strike would have a disruptive impact on the academic calendar and the lives of students, faculty, and staff. In an open letter to the campus community, Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway said the university is committed to negotiating a fair contract but urged the unions to avoid a strike.

""We have made progress, but we are not yet at a point of agreement,"" Holloway wrote. ""A strike could have serious consequences, particularly for our students... I urge our union colleagues to continue bargaining in good faith and to refrain from jeopardizing the academic progress of our students.""

The unions have responded by saying that a strike is a last resort, and they are still hopeful that a solution can be reached through negotiation. But they also argue that the university administration has not taken their demands seriously enough.

Among the unions' key demands are higher salaries and wages. They argue that many employees, particularly those in the lower ranks, are struggling to make ends meet in one of the most expensive regions in the country.

The unions also want better job security, particularly for adjunct faculty members who are often hired on a semester-to-semester basis. They are pushing for longer-term contracts and more job protections.

In addition, they are demanding better benefits, including increased health care coverage and retirement benefits, particularly for employees who have been with the university for many years.

According to the unions, Rutgers has the resources to meet these demands. They point out that the university's endowment has grown significantly over the past decade, and that the administration recently spent millions of dollars on a new athletics center.

But the university administration argues that it operates within strict budget constraints, and that meeting the unions' demands would be too costly. They also point out that the university has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to significant revenue losses.

The negotiation process has been further complicated by the fact that the three unions have different demands and sets of priorities. The AAUP-AFT, which represents about 8,000 faculty members, has been particularly vocal in pushing for better job security and academic freedom, arguing that many faculty members are overworked and underpaid.

Meanwhile, the URA-AFT, which represents about 2,800 administrative staff, has called for better wages and benefits. Many of these workers, who perform critical support functions for the university, have seen their salaries fall behind inflation over the past few years.

The CWA, which represents about 5,000 clerical and technical staff, has also called for better wages, but is also pushing for more job protections and greater respect for the work performed by support staff.

Despite these differences, the unions have stood together in their demands for a fair contract. They have also received support from lawmakers and community leaders, who have called on the university administration to do more to address the concerns of its employees.

In a joint statement, New Jersey's senators, Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, expressed support for the unions, saying that ""workers at Rutgers deserve fair wages and benefits, job security and respect.""

Meanwhile, activists and community groups have staged several protests and rallies in support of the unions. They argue that the contract negotiations are about more than just wages and benefits – they are about ensuring that the university is a fair and equitable workplace that supports its employees and serves its students and community.

As negotiations continue, both sides are under increasing pressure to reach a deal. The unions have set a deadline of April 10 for the university to meet their demands, or they will begin the process of calling for a strike.

The university administration, meanwhile, has said it is committed to finding a solution and avoiding a strike. In a recent statement, Holloway said he remains hopeful that a deal can be reached.

""I am committed to continuing these discussions in good faith and remaining at the table until a mutually acceptable agreement is reached,"" he said.

For now, the fate of the negotiations remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: the contract talks between Rutgers University and its unions are about much more than just money. They are about the future of the university, its employees, and the students and community it serves. And the stakes have never been higher.",1

110,WHO official criticizes China's 'inexcusable' lack of transparency on pandemic's origins,"The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged the world for over a year now, causing millions of deaths and severe disruptions in global economies. As the world struggles to contain the virus, questions remain about its origins, particularly about the initial response of the Chinese government.

Recently, an official from the World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized China's ""inexcusable"" lack of transparency on pandemic's origins, raising concerns about the country's handling of the crisis.

Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO's executive director for emergencies, expressed his dissatisfaction while addressing a press conference on Monday. He said that the WHO team sent to China last month to investigate the origins of the virus had faced obstacles in accessing data from the early days of the outbreak.

Ryan said that the WHO team had requested raw data from the early cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, including the details of 174 cases that the Chinese government had reported in the early stages of the outbreak in December 2019. However, he noted that the team had only received summaries of the findings, which was not enough to carry out a thorough investigation.

""This has been an issue, the whole issue of access to data, access to vital records, access to individuals and so on. That's why we've continued to ask for that full engagement,"" Ryan said.

He added that ""the international community is asking questions that need to be answered, and we need to be able to access evidence-based information in order to help us.""

Ryan's comments came after several scientists and public health experts raised concerns about the Chinese government's handling of the pandemic's origin. Earlier this month, a group of 12 scientists published an open letter calling for a new investigation into how the virus emerged, citing concerns about the independence and transparency of the WHO-led investigation.

The letter, which was published in The Lancet medical journal, called for a new international investigation that would be independent of the Chinese government and free from political influence.

The Chinese government has been accused of downplaying the severity of the outbreak in the early days of the pandemic, which has led to criticism of its handling of the crisis. There have also been concerns about the treatment of whistleblowers who raised alarm about the virus in the early stages.

Last year, Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, who was one of the early whistleblowers, died of COVID-19 after he was reprimanded by Chinese authorities for warning about the virus. His death sparked public outrage and led to calls for greater transparency and accountability from the Chinese government.

The WHO's investigation into the virus's origins has been a complicated process, with some critics arguing that the Chinese government has attempted to withhold information or deflect blame for the pandemic's spread. The WHO team was only allowed to travel to China in January 2021, over a year after the virus first emerged in Wuhan.

Despite the obstacles faced by the WHO team, Ryan said that the investigation was ongoing, and that the agency was still hopeful of getting access to the information it needed.

""We remain committed to working with our colleagues in China to ensure that all of the data and information that we need can be made available to us,"" he said. ""That's a continuing process.""

However, Ryan's comments have also highlighted the growing frustration among global health authorities over the lack of transparency from the Chinese government. Some experts have argued that the WHO investigation may be too little, too late, and that China may never reveal the full extent of its role in the pandemic's origin.

Others have suggested that it may be time for a more drastic approach, including sanctions or other measures against China if it refuses to cooperate fully with investigations.

At the heart of the controversy is the question of transparency and accountability. As the world struggles to contain the virus and recover from its devastating impact, it's essential that all governments, including China, are open and transparent about their role in the crisis.

As Dr. Ryan noted, ""transparency, openness, and engagement are critical in the context of global public health."" Without these qualities, trust in global institutions and cooperation will continue to erode, making it increasingly difficult to tackle future pandemics or other global health crises.",1
111,Why Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson have 'nothing to hide' on 'Sibling Revelry' podcast,"Actors Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson are known not just for their impressive Hollywood film and TV careers but also for their endearing sibling bond. The Hudson siblings, who were born to actress Goldie Hawn and musician Bill Hudson, have now taken their shared passion to a new level with their popular podcast ""Sibling Revelry.""

The podcast, which debuted in November 2019, features the brother-sister duo engaging in candid and unfiltered conversations with guests ranging from family friends to fellow celebrities. In each episode, Kate and Oliver discuss their childhood memories, personal life experiences, and explore the ups and downs of sibling relationships, among other topics.

What makes ""Sibling Revelry"" stand out among the sea of podcasts is the deep trust and honest communication shared by the siblings. Unlike some public figures who tend to keep their personal lives shrouded in mystery, Kate and Oliver have taken the opposite approach, opening up about their respective struggles with mental health, parenting, and relationship struggles.

Their willingness to share their authentic selves has endeared them to their listeners, many of whom are fellow siblings looking for relatable content. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kate attributed the success of the podcast to her and Oliver's shared goal of bringing joy and connection to their audience.

""We wanted to make people feel good,"" she said. ""I think the podcast does that. It uplifts people.""

By sharing their personal stories, Kate and Oliver have also found a way to connect with each other on a deeper level. In a recent episode with comedian Chelsea Handler, the siblings opened up about the challenges they faced growing up with a complex family dynamic.

""It's hard to explain to people what it's like to have a family that's kind of a hodgepodge of step-siblings, and ex-step-siblings and ex-everything,"" Kate said. ""It's a hard thing to navigate when you're young.""

Oliver echoed his sister's sentiments, adding that the family's past struggles have only made their bond stronger.

""We've all still remained close in spite of a lot of things that could have torn us apart,"" he said. ""I don't think any of us have anything to hide.""

This spirit of openness and transparency has resonated with listeners of all ages, particularly younger audiences who may be struggling with their own family relationships. In a recent episode with fashion designer Tory Burch, Kate and Oliver talked about the importance of setting boundaries with family members who may not always have their best interests at heart.

""I think we just have our own insane family that's always been supportive, but has its own issues,"" Kate said. ""I think we all go through those moments where you're like, 'I have to detach from this for a little bit.'""

Oliver added: ""It doesn't mean you don't love them. It just means you have to put up some walls.""

Their candid conversations around mental health have also led to a greater sense of awareness and empathy among their listeners. In an episode with actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate opened up about her struggles with anxiety and depression, and how she has learned to cope with them over the years.

""I've found that anxiety is like a faithful companion,"" she said. ""It never really goes away, but it's just learning how to not let it get the best of you.""

Oliver, who has also been open about his experiences with depression, added: ""It's coming to terms with the fact that it's a part of us. But it's not all of us.""

Their discussions around mental health have also helped to break down the stigma surrounding these issues, particularly in the entertainment industry where mental health can often be seen as a weakness.

In a recent episode with actor Dax Shepard, the siblings talked about the challenges of balancing their careers with their responsibilities as parents. Kate, who has three children, shared her own struggles with mom guilt and the pressure to ""do it all.""

""I think as a mom, you always feel like you're failing somehow,"" she said. ""You're always going to feel like you're short-changing someone.""

Oliver, who has two children, added: ""Parenthood is a huge balancing act. But at the end of the day, it's about being there for your kids and making sure they feel loved.""

Kate and Oliver's honesty and vulnerability on the podcast have also led to some heartwarming moments of sibling connection. In a recent episode with their mother, Goldie Hawn, the siblings reminisced about their childhood memories and the lessons they learned from their parents.

""It's funny how when you get older, you start to appreciate the things your parents taught you,"" Oliver said. ""Even though at the time, you were like, 'I don't want to hear it.'""

Kate added: ""But it all comes back to you when you're a parent, and you're like, 'Oh, that's why they did that.'""

As ""Sibling Revelry"" continues to gain popularity, the Hudson siblings show no signs of slowing down. With a lineup of upcoming guests including fellow siblings Rachel Bloom and Vanessa Hudgens, the podcast promises to stay true to its roots of candid and heartfelt conversations.

In a recent Instagram post, Kate thanked her listeners for their support and credited the success of ""Sibling Revelry"" to the power of sibling relationships.

""I truly believe siblings have a love and bond like no other,"" she wrote. ""It's a relationship that needs celebrating.""

With ""Sibling Revelry,"" Kate and Oliver are doing just that – celebrating the joys and complexities of sibling relationships, while inspiring their listeners to do the same.",1
112,Amazon will charge customers a fee for some UPS returns,"In a move to drive down costs, Amazon is introducing a new fee for customers returning items through UPS. Starting next month, customers will be charged a fee for returns that are not a result of an Amazon error, or if the item was damaged or defective upon arrival.

For years, Amazon has offered free returns on many items, making its customer service one of the most convenient and hassle-free in the industry. However, this has resulted in huge costs for the tech and retail giant, as some customers take advantage of the policy by returning large quantities of items or items that are not defective or damaged.

Amazon has said that the introduction of this fee is a way to encourage customers to think twice before returning items they don't really want, particularly those that are expensive to send back to the company. However, the move is likely to be met with some resistance from Amazon's loyal customers, who have grown accustomed to the company's generous return policy.

Many customers have taken to social media to express their displeasure, saying that the fee will discourage them from shopping on Amazon in the future. Others have pointed out that the new fee is particularly unfair to customers who live in remote areas where returning items is more difficult or expensive.

Despite the backlash, Amazon has stated that the new fee is necessary to keep the cost of doing business down, particularly as the company expands its operations and builds more warehouses and fulfillment centers.

""We want to make it clear that returns are an important part of our business, and we are committed to providing our customers with the best possible experience,"" said an Amazon spokesperson. ""However, we also need to balance that with the need to keep our costs down in order to continue offering the lowest prices and the widest selection of products.""

This move by Amazon is not unprecedented, as other retailers have charged customers for returns for some time. However, Amazon's reputation as a customer-centric company may be put at risk, and it remains to be seen whether the cost savings will ultimately benefit the company in the long run.

113,"Life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth risks can vary depending on where you live, study finds","Pregnancy and childbirth are supposed to be among the happiest moments in a woman's life, but for some women, it could also be one of the most life-threatening experiences. According to a new study, published in The Lancet Global Health, the risk of death and severe childbirth-related complications for women can vary depending on where they live and give birth globally.

The study sheds new light on the disparities that exist in maternal mortality and morbidity between low-income and high-income countries. It reveals that women from regions like sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America are at high risk of maternal death and morbidity as compared to those living in developed countries.

The research, conducted by an international team of researchers from the University of Washington and Harvard, analyzed data from six regions globally: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania. The data was drawn from 28 studies covering over 12 million pregnancies between 2000 and 2018.

The findings revealed significant disparities in maternal mortality in different regions worldwide. Women from Sub-Saharan Africa were found to be the most at risk, with a maternal mortality rate of 534 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. This number was alarmingly high when compared to the maternal mortality rate of just 12 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in Western Europe.

The researchers also found that the risk of life-threatening maternal complications was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, with a 4-5% probability of serious maternal morbidities occurring during childbirth, such as obstetric hemorrhage, postpartum infection, and pre-eclampsia. Meanwhile, the probability of women in western Europe experiencing life-threatening complications was only 1%.

One of the most concerning aspects of this study is that in low-income countries, women are up to 25 times more likely to die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth than women in high-income countries. For example, in Finland, the maternal mortality rate is just three deaths per 100,000 live births, whereas in Sierra Leone, it's 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births.

The study has attributed maternal mortality and morbidity rates to many factors, including the availability and accessibility of good-quality maternal care, the level of education, poverty, and sociodemographic status. A lack of access to quality prenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care plays a significant role in increasing the risk of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates.

In low-income countries, healthcare systems are dilapidated, making it challenging to access quality maternal care. Rural women in developing countries, in particular, are at a disadvantage as hospitals are often situated hundreds of miles away from them, making it burdensome to access emergency maternal care.

""Women in high-income countries have healthcare facilities equipped with emergency equipment, qualified medical personnel who provide comprehensive care plans to expectant mothers,"" said Prof. Oona Campbell, the lead author of the study. ""In the low-income countries, however, the lack of these facilities, personnel, and equipment often have devastating consequences.""

Education is another significant factor that determines maternal mortality rates. Women who are educated have better knowledge of prenatal and postnatal care and can make informed decisions about their health during pregnancy. They are also more likely to seek prenatal care and follow through with health recommendations, such as delivering in a hospital or a health facility.

Furthermore, the poverty status of pregnant women is a significant factor, as it determines the quality of prenatal and antenatal care received. Women from low-income backgrounds are more likely to experience obstructed labor, which increases the risk of life-threatening complications.

The findings of this study highlight an urgent need for countries to invest in their healthcare systems, particularly maternal healthcare, to curb these disparities. Governments need to prioritize maternal safety and ensure that every woman has access to affordable, quality maternal care.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 800 women die every day globally from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. Approximately 94% of these deaths occur in low-income countries, and the majority of these deaths are preventable.

The WHO has set out clear guidelines that could help countries reduce global maternal mortality rates by 75% by 2030. These guidelines emphasize improving maternal care and ensuring that all women receive the recommended comprehensive care before, during, and after childbirth.

While much progress has been made in promoting maternal health care globally, much more needs to be done to ensure that every woman has access to quality maternal care, regardless of location or social status.

""There's a need for concerted efforts from governments, healthcare providers, and policymakers to improve the situation,"" said Prof. Campbell. ""Maternal health emergencies can happen at any time, any place, and to any woman. It's, therefore, imperative that every woman has access to good-quality maternal care that can potentially save their lives.""

In conclusion, the study's findings highlight the need for increased investment in maternal healthcare in low-income countries to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates. Ensuring that comprehensive maternal care is accessible to every woman, improving access to education, poverty alleviation programs, and improving healthcare infrastructure in low-income countries is crucial.

Given that maternal mortality and morbidity are preventable, governments, healthcare providers, and policymakers should prioritize maternal health care to ensure that every woman has a chance to safely deliver a child and enjoy one of the most meaningful experiences of womanhood.",1

115,Tucker Carlson raged against Trump in private. But in interview with the former president he took a very different tone,"During the Trump administration, Tucker Carlson was seen as a close ally and supporter of the former president. He regularly used his platform on Fox News to vehemently defend Trump and his policies, and was even seen as a potential future presidential candidate himself.

However, reports have now emerged that Carlson had a very different perspective on Trump in private. According to a new book by journalists Jonathan Swan and Axios co-founder Mike Allen, Carlson had some harsh words to say about Trump during a private meeting with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser.

In the meeting, Carlson reportedly criticized Trump for his handling of the pandemic, stating that he didn't take the virus seriously enough and that his response was inadequate. He also reportedly criticized Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, for his role in the administration.

These comments are shocking given Carlson's public support for Trump over the years. However, what is even more surprising is Carlson's recent interview with Trump for Fox News. In the interview, Carlson adopted a completely different tone, praising Trump and his leadership during his four years in the White House.

During the interview, Carlson asked Trump softball questions about his accomplishments as president, including his foreign policy achievements and his handling of the pandemic. He praised Trump for his ""toughness"" and ""courage,"" and even praised his ""Superman-like"" physical abilities.

The stark contrast between Carlson's private criticism of Trump and his fawning interview on Fox News raises serious questions about his integrity as a journalist. One could argue that Carlson owes it to his viewers to provide a truthful and unbiased assessment of political figures, regardless of his personal feelings about them.

Furthermore, Carlson's cozy relationship with Trump during his presidency calls into question the independence and impartiality of Fox News as a news organization. The network has faced criticism in the past for its perceived bias towards the Republican Party and right-wing politics, but this latest revelation about Carlson's private criticisms of Trump only serves to reinforce these concerns.

It is important for journalists and news organizations to maintain a strict separation between their personal beliefs and their professional obligations to the public. By providing a platform for Carlson to interview Trump, Fox News is sending a message that it is willing to overlook any personal biases or conflicts of interest in order to promote its own agenda.

In the end, it is up to the public to decide whether or not they can trust journalists like Tucker Carlson to provide them with fair and honest reporting. Carlson's personal opinions about Trump may be irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, but his willingness to put his own biases aside in order to further his career raises serious concerns about the state of journalism in America today.",1
116,Living standards are still falling in Japan. That's a recipe for more stagnation,"As one of the world's most developed countries, Japan is often held up as an example of success and progress. However, beneath the surface, there are serious challenges facing the nation's economy and society. In particular, living standards in Japan continue to fall, in what is becoming a worrying trend for the country's future.

The reasons for this decline are complex, but some of the most significant factors include an aging population, declining birth rates, and high levels of debt. Additionally, the country has been grappling with the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure and economy.

According to the Japanese government's own data, the country's real GDP per capita has fallen for the fifth consecutive year in 2020, meaning that the average person in Japan has less purchasing power now than they did five years ago. This is a significant concern, given that Japan has one of the highest standards of living in the world, and has long been considered a model for other countries to follow.

One of the main drivers of this decline in living standards is the country's aging population. Japan has one of the oldest populations in the world, with almost 30% of the population over the age of 65. This means there are fewer people of working age to support the country's economy and contribute to its growth. In addition, older people tend to spend less money, as they are often on fixed incomes and have fewer financial obligations.

Moreover, Japan's declining birth rate is exacerbating this demographic shift. The country's birth rate has been steadily decreasing for decades, which means that there are fewer young people to replace the older generation as they retire. This creates a vicious cycle of falling consumption, lower economic growth, and declining living standards, as there are fewer people to support the country's economy and pay for social services.

Adding to these challenges is Japan's high level of debt. The country has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, which means that it owes more money than it produces each year. This is a significant problem, as it makes it difficult for the country to invest in infrastructure, education, and other services that could help stimulate economic growth and improve living standards. Instead, the government has been forced to cut spending on social services, which has led to lower living standards for many people in the country.

There are also other issues affecting the country's economy and society, such as high levels of income inequality, a lack of social mobility, and a rigid labor market. These factors make it difficult for people to find good-paying jobs and achieve financial security, which in turn makes it harder for them to support their families and contribute to the economy.

To make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on Japan's economy, exacerbating many of these existing challenges. The country's GDP shrank by almost 28% in the second quarter of 2020, which is the largest decline in the country's history. This has led to job losses, business closures, and significant economic hardship for many people in the country.

All of these factors create a perfect storm of challenges for Japan's future. If left unchecked, the country could face a prolonged period of stagnation and decline, as more people struggle to make ends meet and the economy sputters along.

To address these challenges, the Japanese government will need to take decisive action to stimulate economic growth, invest in social services and infrastructure, and create opportunities for young people to succeed. This will require significant political will and bold policy initiatives, which may be difficult to achieve given the country's stagnant political climate and entrenched interests.

However, the stakes are too high for Japan to simply continue on its current course. The country's future depends on its ability to adapt and change, to find new ways of supporting economic growth and improving living standards for all people.

Ultimately, the challenges facing Japan are not unique to the country. Many developed nations face similar challenges as their populations age and their economies mature. However, what sets Japan apart is its long history of innovation and adaptability. If the country can tap into these strengths and find innovative new solutions to its challenges, then it may yet be able to reverse the trend of falling living standards and spark a new era of growth and prosperity.",1
117,"Mother of 6-year-old who shot teacher turns herself in on child neglect charge, her attorney says","The mother of a first-grader who brought a gun to his school in Townville, South Carolina last week and shot his teacher has turned herself in on a child neglect charge. The attorney of the mother, who has been identified as Tiffney Osborne, released a statement to CNN confirming her surrender.

The incident occurred last Wednesday when the six-year-old boy opened fire on two students and a teacher at Townville Elementary School. The teacher, identified as Meghan Hollingsworth, was hit in the shoulder and was airlifted to the hospital for treatment. The two students were injured during the shooting, but their injuries were not life-threatening. The young boy has been charged as a juvenile with attempted murder and murder after the death of his father.

Criminal charges against Tiffney Osborne have not been filed in connection with the Townville shooting, however, she was taken into custody on a child neglect charge, that could be connected to the shooting or other incidents of neglect. The charge is a felony, and if she is found guilty, she could face up to ten years in prison. Osborne's attorney has not yet specified the exact details behind the child neglect charge.

According to a statement released by the Anderson County Sheriff's Office, the mother was arrested on the child neglect charge following an investigation into the home where the six-year-old boy lived. The investigation was conducted by the state's Department of Social Services, and it uncovered evidence that the boy and his siblings were living in ""substandard"" conditions.

Osborne's attorney stated that she did not knowingly place her children in danger, and that she has cooperated with authorities throughout the investigation. ""Ms. Osborne has been cooperating fully with the Department of Social Services and law enforcement throughout this ordeal,"" the statement said. ""She had no knowledge that her son possessed or had access to the gun used in the incident at Townville Elementary School.""

In a previous statement, the attorney also expressed condolences to the victims of the Townville shooting. ""Ms. Osborne is devastated by the tragedy that occurred at the Townville Elementary School,"" the statement said. ""Her thoughts and prayers are with the injured and their families, as well as the entire Townville community.""

The shooting has once again highlighted the issue of gun ownership and its relation to child safety. While some are calling for tighter gun laws to prevent such incidents, others are pointing fingers at the neglectful families.

Meanwhile, the school where the shooting occurred remains closed this week as investigators comb the premises for further evidence. The students and teachers are being offered counseling services to help them cope with the trauma of the incident.

The Townville shooting comes amid an unprecedented surge in gun violence across the United States. Incidents ranging from mass shootings to individual incidents of gun violence are occurring at an alarming rate, particularly in major cities. Lawmakers and activists continue to debate the issue, with some calling for a complete overhaul of the country's gun laws, while others are pushing for stricter legislation.

Last week's Townville shooting has shaken the small South Carolina town and communities across the country. The spotlight is now on the mother of the young shooter and the conditions in which he was raised. Many are now urging authorities to take a closer look at the homes where gun violence has taken place to prevent further tragedies from occurring.

As for the mother of the six-year-old shooter, she is currently being held at the Anderson County Detention Center on a $35,000 bond. Her attorney has expressed confidence that she will be exonerated of any neglect charges that may be filed against her in connection with the incident. The six-year-old boy is currently being held in a juvenile detention facility, awaiting further legal action.",1

119,"Project that gave $500 a month to some California residents shows that such efforts could have a 'profound impact on public health, researchers say","A groundbreaking experiment in California provided $500 a month for two years to some residents of Stockton, a city with high rates of poverty and crime, with no strings attached. The purpose of the project was to evaluate the impacts of unconditional cash transfers on income, employment, and health.

The project, which was funded by a number of philanthropic organizations, gave 125 randomly chosen low-income residents the monthly cash payment, which is equivalent to about 30% of the city’s median income. The recipients were allowed to use the money in any way they wished, whether it was to pay for bills or groceries, childcare, or simply to indulge in some discretionary spending.

The experiment turned out to be a resounding success, as it provided a significant boost to the health and well-being of the residents. The researchers, who published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences earlier this week, noted that the program had a profound impact on public health, which could have broad implications for addressing the many social and economic challenges that the country faces.

According to the findings, those receiving the cash payments showed a considerable improvement in their mental health, with signs of reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. The research also found that the program had a positive effect on the physical health of the beneficiaries. They reported fewer health problems, including symptoms of high blood pressure and heart disease.

Another important aspect of the study is that it led to an increase in job prospects for the residents. While the program did not require the recipients to work, the findings revealed that most of them used the money to invest in job training and other education opportunities, which eventually led to better employment outcomes.

The program has been lauded as a major achievement in public policy, with advocates highlighting its potential benefits for millions of Americans. The success of initiatives like this could help lower the poverty rate and enhance the overall well-being of the population.

In a statement, the researchers said that they hope the findings will encourage policymakers to take a closer look at unconditional cash transfers as a tool for addressing the many social and economic challenges that the country faces. They stressed that the benefits of the program-provided valuable lessons on how to better support vulnerable communities.

The project’s visionary founder, Michael Tubbs, the former Mayor of Stockton, said in an interview with CNN that he hopes the research will serve as a model for other cities to implement similar programs. “I think we can all agree that if you’re unhealthy and if you’re worrying about how you’re going to keep the lights on, your ability to participate in civic life increases quite a bit,” he said.

The cash transfer experiment comes as the US faces widespread poverty and inequality, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic. A number of cities and states have introduced similar initiatives over the last few years. For instance, Newark, New Jersey, and St. Paul, Minnesota, have both launched pilot programs to provide income support to residents.

Advocates of universal basic income (UBI) view these programs as a way to combat inequality, provide more secure and stable employment, and give people greater economic freedom. Critics, however, argue that they are unsustainable and that they discourage work, while others say that they shouldn’t replace government programs for the poor but rather add to them.

However, proponents of the programs, like billionaire entrepreneur and presidential candidate Andrew Yang, argue that UBI can stimulate economic growth and help people prepare for the changing nature of work. Yang has also noted that cash transfers can be an essential part of a larger economic transformation enabling more people to have the modern skills required for success.

The Stockton experiment has served as an important reminder that the US needs to rethink its approach to social welfare programs. Keeping pace with modern economic trends and bringing vulnerable communities into the fold requires innovative solutions that go beyond traditional approaches.

While policymakers grapple with the future of assistance programs, many are hopeful that the program’s success will pave the way for broader and more comprehensive reforms to address the structural challenges that hold so many Americans back.

In sum, the project that gave $500 a month to some California residents demonstrates that unconditional cash transfers have the potential to provide vital support to those in need. By giving people the freedom to use the money as they see fit, these programs could have a profound impact on health, wellbeing, and economic outcomes, ultimately serving as vital tools for addressing the many social and economic challenges that the US faces.",1
120,"Lori Vallow Daybell, Idaho mother accused of killing her children and conspiring to kill husband's ex-wife, was motivated by 'money, power and sex,' prosecutors say","Lori Vallow Daybell, the Idaho mother who has been accused of killing her two children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow and conspiring to kill her husband's ex-wife, was motivated by 'money, power and sex,' prosecutors said in a court filing.

The filing was made to support the prosecution's request to deny bail for Daybell, whose children's remains were found on her husband's property in eastern Idaho on June 9.

The prosecution argued that Daybell's ""beliefs and interest in doomsday preparedness"" and her relationship with her new husband, Chad Daybell, were also a significant factor in her alleged crimes.

""Lori Vallow Daybell is a flight risk, she is a danger to the community, and the evidence presented in this case has compelled law enforcement and prosecutors to conclude that the only thing that motivated Lori Daybell was her own desires,"" the filing states.

The filing goes on to detail the financial incentives that prosecutors say motivated Daybell. They claim she was plotting to kill her husband's ex-wife, Tammy Daybell, so she could collect her life insurance policy, which was worth $430,000.

""Tammy Daybell is no longer around because Lori Vallow Daybell wanted Chad Daybell for herself, and Chad Daybell wanted Tammy Daybell out of the picture,"" the filing states.

The prosecution also argues that Daybell's children were ""obstacles"" to her relationship with Chad Daybell, who she married just weeks after the children disappeared. According to the filing, Daybell told a friend that Tylee was ""a problem"" who had become ""a threat to her relationship with Chad Daybell.""

The document also includes information from several witnesses, including Daybell's former best friend, Melanie Gibb, who told investigators that Daybell had informed her that her children had been ""possessed"" and had become ""zombies."" The document alleges that Daybell told her friend that it was the only way she could justify killing her children.

The prosecution also claims that Daybell had a history of manipulating people for her own benefit. They point to her relationship with her now-deceased fourth husband, Charles Vallow, which they describe as ""volatile."" The filing states that Daybell's behavior towards her husband had become increasingly erratic and that she had become emotionally and physically abusive towards him.

The prosecution also argues that Daybell's involvement in the murder of her husband was motivated by financial gain. They allege that Daybell convinced her husband to take out a $1 million life insurance policy and then conspired with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill him so she could collect the money. Cox died in December from what was described as ""natural causes.""

The document argues that Daybell's ""post-offense conduct"" shows that she is aware of the gravity of her situation and is actively trying to evade prosecution. They point to her decision to leave Idaho after she was asked to produce her children to authorities, her refusal to cooperate with investigations into their disappearance and the fact that she has been ""actively seeking resources"" to flee the country.

The filing concludes by stating that Daybell's actions were a result of her own selfish desires and that she poses a risk to society.

""Lori Vallow Daybell's actions had nothing to do with love, protection or family. The motivation for her crimes was money, power and sex,"" the document states.

The case has garnered widespread attention and has been covered extensively in the media. A ""48 Hours"" special on the case aired on CBS in July, and a two-hour ""Dateline"" special is set to air on NBC on Friday.

Daybell is currently being held on a $1 million bond. She has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit murder, grand theft, and several other charges related to the disappearance and deaths of her children.

Chad Daybell, who is also charged in the case, has not yet entered a plea. He was arrested in June on charges of concealing evidence and is currently being held on a $1 million bond.

It remains unclear when the couple's trial will begin, but it is expected to be a high-profile case that will draw significant attention from the media and the public.",1
121,Drugs suspect escapes Hong Kong court by switching wristbands with another man,"Hong Kong, China - A drugs suspect has escaped from the Hong Kong High Court by switching wristbands with another man. The suspect, who is yet to be named, was on trial for drug trafficking when he escaped from the court on Thursday morning.

The suspect was reportedly wearing two wristbands, one of which granted him access to the court dock, while the other was a normal visitor's wristband. It is said that he switched the visitor's wristband with that of another man sitting in the public gallery.

As soon as the suspect was let out of the dock, he walked out of the court premises unnoticed. The other man, who was wearing the suspect's wristband, was later detained by the court authorities.

The police have launched a manhunt for the escaped suspect and have alerted the public to be on the lookout. They have also urged anyone with information about the escape to come forward.

The suspect was facing charges of drug trafficking, a crime that carries the death penalty in Hong Kong. His escape has raised serious concerns about the security measures in place at the Hong Kong High Court.

The Hong Kong Judiciary has released a statement expressing regret over the incident and promising to review the security measures in place. They have also assured the public that the case will not be affected by the incident and will proceed as scheduled.

This is not the first time that a suspect has escaped from custody in Hong Kong. Earlier this year, a man who was being held on suspicion of murder escaped from a hospital by jumping out of a window. He was later apprehended and charged with attempted murder.

The case has once again highlighted the need for stronger security measures and stricter regulations in Hong Kong's judicial system. The police and the judiciary are expected to work together to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in the future.

In conclusion, the escape of the drugs suspect from the Hong Kong High Court is a serious breach of security and raises serious questions about the safety measures in place. The authorities must take immediate action to ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future.",1
122,More symptoms than you think may be tied to your migraines,"Migraines are more than just a throbbing headache. They are often accompanied by a range of symptoms and can greatly affect a person's quality of life. While most people associate migraines with head pain, there are actually a number of other symptoms that can be tied to migraines.

According to the Migraine Research Foundation, migraines affect approximately 12% of the population, with women being three times more likely to experience them than men. While the exact cause of migraines is still unknown, researchers believe they are connected to changes in the brain and surrounding blood vessels.

In addition to head pain, migraines can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and dizziness. Yet, there are several other symptoms that are less commonly known to be associated with migraines.

Aura: Auras are visual disturbances that often occur before the onset of a migraine headache. They can include flashes of light, blind spots, or wavy lines in the visual field. Auras usually last for less than an hour and can be a key symptom in identifying migraines.

Fatigue: Extreme tiredness is a symptom that can be associated with migraines. People who experience migraines may feel drained or exhausted for several days before or after the actual headache.

Neck pain: Migraines can often cause tension in the neck muscles, leading to neck pain. This pain can range from a dull ache to a sharp, shooting pain and may last for several days.

Jaw pain: Tightness and pain in the jaw muscles can also be a symptom of migraines. This is often caused by clenching the jaw in response to the pain of the headache.

Vertigo: Vertigo is a sensation of dizziness or spinning that can accompany migraines. The spinning sensation may be mild or severe and can last for several minutes or hours.

Depression and anxiety: It has been found that people who suffer from migraines are at a higher risk of developing depression and anxiety disorders. Some researchers believe that the physical and emotional strain of migraines can lead to these mental health issues.

Brain fog: Migraines can cause cognitive difficulties, including confusion and difficulty concentrating, commonly referred to as ""brain fog"". This can make it difficult to remember things or carry out tasks.

Numbness and tingling: Some people experience numbness or tingling sensations in the face, arms, or legs, during or before a migraine headache. These sensations may be mild or severe and can occur on one or both sides of the body.

Stomach problems: The digestive system can also be affected by migraines, leading to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

While many of these symptoms are less commonly known to be associated with migraines, they can greatly impact a person's life. In some cases, they may even be more debilitating than the head pain itself. For instance, constant fatigue or brain fog can make it difficult for someone to work or carry out daily tasks, while frequent vomiting or stomach problems may lead to malnutrition and other health issues.

However, the good news is that there are treatment options available for migraines that can help manage both the head pain and the accompanying symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be effective for mild headaches, while prescription medications such as triptans and ergotamines can help alleviate more severe migraines.

Lifestyle changes such as stress reduction techniques, regular exercise, and adequate sleep can also be helpful in managing migraines. In addition, avoiding triggers such as certain foods, stress, and changes in sleep patterns can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines.

If you experience migraines and are struggling with symptoms beyond head pain, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can help diagnose your migraines and develop a treatment plan that addresses all of your symptoms.

In addition to medication and lifestyle changes, there are several alternative therapies that may be effective in managing migraines. For instance, acupuncture, massage, and herbal remedies have all been found to be helpful in reducing the frequency and severity of migraines.

In conclusion, migraines are more than just a simple headache. They come with a range of symptoms that can greatly impact a person's life. While many of these symptoms are lesser-known, it's important to recognize them to aid in early diagnosis and proper treatment. If you suffer from migraines, talk to your healthcare provider and explore all treatment options available. With proper management, you can reduce the frequency and severity of your migraines and improve your quality of life.",1
123,Twitter brands BBC a 'government funded media' organization,"In a controversial move, Twitter users have been branding the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) a ""government funded media"" organization.

The hashtag #BBCgovUK began trending on the platform on Monday, with many users questioning the impartiality of the broadcaster due to its funding from the UK government.

The BBC is publicly funded through a license fee paid by UK households, which means in essence it is funded by the government. This has sparked a debate about whether the broadcaster can truly be independent.

Critics argue that the BBC's funding model means that it is under pressure to report news in a way that is favorable to the government, particularly when it comes to controversial issues such as Brexit or the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BBC denies that it has any political bias and says that it is committed to impartial and accurate reporting.

However, many Twitter users remain unconvinced. Some have accused the broadcaster of failing to challenge the government on important issues and of being too close to politicians.

The controversy comes at a difficult time for the BBC, which has been hit by a series of funding cuts in recent years. The broadcaster is also facing increased competition from online news outlets, which have more freedom to express political opinions.

Despite this, the BBC remains the UK's most popular media organization, with millions of viewers and listeners tuning in to its news programs every day.

Whether the branding of the BBC as a ""government funded media"" organization will have any long-term impact on its reputation remains to be seen. However, it is clear that the broadcaster is facing increasing scrutiny over its funding and impartiality, and will need to work hard to regain the trust of its audience in the coming years.",1
124,Juul to pay $462 million to six states in its largest settlement ever,"In its largest settlement ever, e-cigarette giant Juul has agreed to pay a total of $462 million to the states of California, New York, Illinois, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania to resolve claims that it fueled a youth vaping epidemic.

According to a statement released by the California Attorney General's Office on Monday, the settlement will require Juul to pay $272 million over the next six years to fund prevention programs aimed at curbing youth vaping.

""Today's settlement holds Juul accountable for its role in fueling the youth vaping epidemic, and requires Juul to pay an historic $272 million to fund critically needed research and prevention efforts,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.

The settlement also mandates that Juul must avoid targeting minors in its advertising and marketing, and include a new system for verifying the age of online customers.

The deal comes as Juul faces mounting legal and regulatory pressure in the United States. The company is currently the subject of a federal investigation into its marketing practices, and is facing numerous lawsuits from individuals who claim that they were harmed by using its products.

Despite these challenges, Juul has continued to assert that its e-cigarettes are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco products, and that they are intended for adult use only. However, critics argue that Juul's fruity flavors and sleek design have made its products particularly appealing to young people, and that the company has engaged in aggressive marketing tactics aimed at enticing underage users.

""Our settlement sends a clear message to Juul and any other company that prioritizes profits over the health and well-being of our young people,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James.

While Juul has pledged to uphold the terms of the settlement, the company has also pushed back against some of the allegations against it. In a statement released on Monday, Juul argued that it has ""made sweeping changes"" to its business practices in recent years, including ceasing the sale of flavored products in retail stores and shutting down its social media accounts.

""We remain focused on earning the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders to combat underage use and convert adult smokers from combustible cigarettes,"" said Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite.

Nevertheless, the settlement represents a significant victory for those who have been calling for greater regulation of the e-cigarette industry. The agreement comes at a time when vaping-related illnesses and deaths have been on the rise across the country, prompting concerns about the safety of e-cigarettes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported more than 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths associated with vaping-related illnesses in the United States since 2019. Although the majority of these cases have been linked to the use of black market THC products, health officials have warned that e-cigarettes may also pose a risk to users' health.

""Today's settlement is a critical step towards holding Juul accountable for its role in the youth vaping epidemic,"" said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. ""We must continue to work together to protect our children from the harmful effects of all tobacco and nicotine products.""

With the settlement now finalized, Juul will be required to make annual payments to the six states involved over the next six years. The company will also be required to submit regular reports detailing its marketing and sales practices, and its efforts to prevent underage use of its products.

The settlement represents a new chapter in the ongoing debate over e-cigarettes, and could have significant implications for the future of the industry. As concerns about the safety of vaping continue to mount, it seems likely that other states and regulatory bodies will follow in California and New York's footsteps, launching their own investigations into the practices of e-cigarette companies like Juul.",1

126,"Alzheimer's first signs may appear in your eyes, study finds","New research has found that the first signs of Alzheimer's disease may actually appear in the eyes. According to a study published in the journal Ophthalmology Retina, changes in the retina could serve as an early indicator of the disease's onset.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that leads to memory loss, personality changes, and difficulties in performing everyday tasks. It is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 5.8 million Americans, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Early diagnosis is key to managing the symptoms and improving quality of life.

The study used advanced imaging techniques to analyze the retinas of patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as those with mild cognitive impairment and healthy control individuals. The researchers found that certain changes in the retina, such as a thinning of the nerve fibers and a loss of blood vessels, were more pronounced in Alzheimer's patients.

""We know that there are changes that occur in the brain in Alzheimer's disease, and because the retina is an extension of the brain, we wanted to investigate whether there are similar changes that could be detected in the eye using non-invasive techniques,"" said lead study author Sharon Fekrat, M.D., a professor of ophthalmology at Duke University School of Medicine.

The study provides promising evidence that analyzing the retina could be a valuable tool in detecting Alzheimer's disease at an earlier stage. Currently, doctors rely on a combination of cognitive tests, brain imaging, and clinical evaluations to diagnose the disease, which can take years to progress to an advanced state.

By the time symptoms become noticeable, irreversible damage has already occurred in the brain, which limits the effectiveness of available treatments. But if changes in the retina could be identified as an early indicator, patients could receive treatment sooner.

""This study reinforces the idea that the eyes are a window to the brain in Alzheimer's disease,"" said Heather Snyder, Ph.D., vice president of medical and scientific relations at the Alzheimer's Association. ""While more research is needed in larger groups, the results are promising.""

The study also suggests that the same imaging techniques used to analyze the retina could be used to monitor the progression of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the effectiveness of treatments.

""We envision that ophthalmic imaging could be used as a screening tool to detect Alzheimer's disease in its early stages before cognitive decline begins,"" said Fekrat. ""Given the ease and non-invasive nature of this imaging technique, its potential as a screening tool is exciting.""

The research has important implications for the future of Alzheimer's disease. As the population ages and the number of people affected by the disease grows, early detection and intervention will become increasingly important.

""We need to detect the disease earlier and introduce treatments earlier to have the most impact,"" said Snyder. ""This study moves us one step closer to achieving that goal.""

The study is part of a growing body of research exploring the potential use of the eyes in diagnosing various diseases. In recent years, researchers have identified links between eye health and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

""Traditionally, the eyes have been viewed as an isolated system,"" said Fekrat. ""But we now know that changes in the eyes can reflect changes in the rest of the body. The eyes may be a way to detect diseases earlier and more accurately than current methods.""

While the study is still in its early stages, its findings provide hope that a non-invasive and affordable screening tool for Alzheimer's disease could be within reach.

""We're excited to see where this research leads,"" said Snyder. ""If we can detect Alzheimer's earlier, we can empower individuals and their families to make informed decisions about their health and future.""",1
127,"Volcano erupts in Russia's far east, spewing ash 20 kilometers into the air","A volcano in Russia's far east has erupted, spewing ash up to 20 kilometers into the sky. The eruption occurred at 4:20 a.m. local time on Wednesday, and the ash cloud has spread over 100 kilometers from the site.

The volcano, located on the Kamchatka peninsula, is one of the most active in Russia. It has been under close observation by scientists for years, and there were no warnings of an imminent eruption. The sudden activity caught many residents off guard, with some reporting experiencing earthquakes and hearing loud sounds.

According to the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team (KVERT), the ash cloud is moving towards the Pacific Ocean and is not currently posing a threat to any populated areas. However, the team warns that the situation could change rapidly, and the ash cloud may begin to affect nearby towns and cities if the eruption continues.

Local authorities have issued warnings for residents to stay indoors and avoid going outside unless absolutely necessary. The ash can cause respiratory problems and eye irritation, and can also damage electronic equipment.

The eruption has also impacted air travel in the region, with several flights cancelled or diverted to alternate airports. The Kamchatka International Airport has been closed until further notice.

The volcano will continue to be monitored closely by scientists to assess the ongoing risk to the local population. The eruption serves as a reminder of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of our planet's geology, and the need for constant vigilance in areas prone to volcanic activity.",1
128,"About 100,000 nurses left the workforce due to pandemic-related burnout and stress, survey finds","The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge for healthcare professionals worldwide. Nurses, in particular, have been at the forefront of the crisis, working tirelessly to care for patients while putting their own health at risk. But the toll of the pandemic on nurses' emotional and mental well-being has been immense, according to a new survey.

The American Nurses Foundation's Workforce Survey found that around 100,000 nurses have left the workforce due to pandemic-related burnout and stress. The survey, which was conducted in April 2021, included responses from over 22,000 registered nurses across the United States.

Among the nurses who left the workforce, over 60% cited burnout as the main reason for their departure. Other factors that contributed to nurses' decision to leave included retirement, COVID-related health concerns, and inadequate support from their employers.

The survey also found that nurses who remained in the workforce reported increased levels of stress and burnout since the beginning of the pandemic. Over 70% of nurses reported feeling exhausted and overworked, while 44% reported feeling anxious or depressed.

""The pandemic has put an immense strain on our healthcare system, and nurses have borne the brunt of that strain,"" said Karen Cox, PhD, RN, FAAN, president of the American Nurses Association. ""Many nurses have been working long hours, dealing with emotionally challenging situations, and putting their own health at risk. It's not surprising that so many are experiencing burnout and stress.""

The findings of the survey highlight the urgent need for healthcare organizations to prioritize nurses' mental and emotional health. Nurses are an essential part of the healthcare workforce, and without adequate support and resources, the already-existing nursing shortage will continue to worsen.

To address these issues, the American Nurses Foundation has launched a campaign called ""Well-Being Initiative for Nurses,"" which aims to provide nurses with resources and support for maintaining their mental and emotional health. The initiative includes a digital support platform with tools and resources for self-care, as well as a grant program for organizations working to improve nurses' well-being.

""The Well-Being Initiative for Nurses is a critical step in addressing the mental and emotional health of nurses,"" Cox said. ""We need to make sure that our nurses have access to the resources and support they need to maintain their well-being and continue to provide high-quality care to patients.""

Nursing organizations and healthcare institutions have also started to recognize the importance of addressing burnout and stress among nurses. Many hospitals and healthcare systems have implemented programs and policies aimed at reducing workplace stress and offering support for mental health concerns.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the healthcare industry. Nurses, in particular, have been working under extremely difficult conditions, and the toll on their mental and emotional well-being has been immense. The American Nurses Foundation's Workforce Survey highlights the need for immediate action to address the issue of burnout and stress among nurses.

The nursing shortage that existed before the pandemic has only been exacerbated by nurses leaving the workforce due to burnout and stress. Healthcare organizations must prioritize nurses' mental and emotional health and provide them with the resources and support they need to continue providing high-quality care to patients. The Well-Being Initiative for Nurses is a significant step in that direction, but it will take a collective effort to make a meaningful difference for nurses across the country.",1
129,OPEC's surprise production cut complicates the Fed's fight against inflation,"In a move that caught most market analysts off guard, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced a surprise production cut of 1.2 million barrels per day at their recent meeting in Vienna. The decision is expected to have significant implications for the global economy, including complicating the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.

OPEC's decision to cut production comes as a response to the oversupply of oil in the global market. Despite the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran, as well as declining oil production in countries like Venezuela, oil prices remained low due to record levels of production from the United States. The production cut is aimed at stabilizing oil prices, which have fallen by more than 30 percent since October.

While the production cut is good news for oil-producing countries, it could have negative implications for countries that are heavily dependent on oil imports, particularly emerging markets. Countries like India and China, both of which are experiencing slower economic growth, are already struggling with high levels of inflation. A hike in oil prices will only exacerbate the problem, putting pressure on central banks to raise interest rates to control inflation.

The decision by OPEC to cut production complicates the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation. The Fed has been raising interest rates gradually over the past few years as a means of curbing inflation. However, with oil prices rising, the Fed may find itself in a difficult position.

Higher oil prices generally result in higher inflation, as they increase the cost of goods and services that rely on energy. With unemployment at record lows and wages on the rise, inflation is already starting to creep up. The Fed has already signaled its intention to continue raising interest rates to keep a lid on inflation, and the unexpected decision by OPEC to cut production will only add to that pressure.

The production cut by OPEC is also likely to lead to a shakeup in the stock market. Energy companies are likely to benefit from the decision, as higher oil prices increase profits. However, some industries, particularly those that rely heavily on energy, may see their profits decline, leading to a potentially volatile stock market.

The decision also has geopolitical implications. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, has been under intense scrutiny following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The production cut is seen as a way for the country to repair its image on the global stage. It is also seen as a way for the Saudi government to generate more revenue, as it has been struggling with budget deficits in recent years.

While the production cut is aimed at benefiting the global economy, it may lead to unintended consequences. The U.S. has already expressed its disappointment with the decision, with President Trump tweeting his displeasure with OPEC's decision. The U.S. has been particularly vocal about its opposition to oil prices rising, as it could put a damper on the country's economic growth.

In conclusion, OPEC's surprise production cut has significant implications for the global economy. While it is aimed at stabilizing oil prices, it could have negative consequences for countries that rely heavily on oil imports, particularly emerging markets. It also complicates the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation, as higher oil prices could lead to higher inflation and put pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates. The decision is likely to lead to volatility in the stock market, and its geopolitical implications could also have far-reaching consequences. While the production cut is aimed at benefitting the global economy as a whole, it is possible that it may lead to unintended consequences in the months and years ahead.",1
130,Laughter is therapy for the mind and body,"Laughter truly is the best medicine. It is a simple but powerful tool that can improve our physical and mental health in countless ways. From reducing stress and anxiety to boosting our immune system, laughter is a natural remedy for many common ailments.

The idea that laughter is good for our health is not new. The ancient Greeks believed that laughter was a cure for melancholy, and many cultures have long used humor and laughter in healing rituals. Today, science is catching up with this ancient wisdom and providing evidence to support the health benefits of laughter.

One of the most obvious benefits of laughter is its ability to reduce stress. When we laugh, our body releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosting chemicals. These chemicals help to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety and can even help us to cope with physical pain.

In addition to reducing stress, laughter has also been shown to improve our immune system. When we’re stressed or anxious, we release hormones like cortisol, which can weaken our immune system over time. However, when we laugh, our body releases a surge of antibodies and immune cells, which help to protect us against infection and disease.

Laughter can also help to improve our mental health. Depression and anxiety are increasingly common in our society, and many people struggle to find effective treatments for these conditions. However, laughter therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for depression and anxiety by reducing the symptoms of these disorders.

As well as reducing stress and anxiety, laughter can also help to improve our mood and overall sense of well-being. When we laugh, it can help us to feel more connected to others, improve our communication skills, and make us feel more optimistic about life. This can have a positive effect on our relationships, work performance, and overall quality of life.

Laughter can also help us to cope with difficult situations. Life can be tough, and sometimes we need a little help to get through the hard times. Laughter therapy can be a useful tool in helping us to cope with stress, trauma, and grief. By releasing tension and improving our mood, laughter can help us to feel more resilient and better able to cope with whatever life throws our way.

Of course, not all humor is created equal. While some forms of humor can be funny and uplifting, others can be negative and hurtful. There is a fine line between humor that is good for us and humor that is harmful. To get the most out of laughter, it’s important to choose humor that is positive, uplifting, and respectful of others.

Laughter is also highly contagious. When we hear someone else laughing, it can be difficult not to join in. This is why laughter therapy is often done in groups, where people can feed off each other’s energy and build a sense of community. This can be especially useful for people who are feeling isolated or lonely.

Laughter therapy can take many forms. It can be as simple as watching a funny movie, reading a humorous book, or sharing a joke with a friend. It can also be more structured, with trained therapists leading group laughter sessions or using humor as part of a larger therapy program.

One popular form of laughter therapy is known as Laughter Yoga. This involves a series of laughter exercises and deep breathing techniques designed to release tension and promote a sense of well-being. Laughter Yoga is often done in groups, and participants are encouraged to let go of their inhibitions and laugh as much as possible.

Laughter therapy has been growing in popularity in recent years, and many people are discovering the benefits of incorporating laughter into their daily lives. While laughter therapy is not a substitute for medical treatment, it can be a useful tool in managing a wide range of physical and mental health problems.

Laughter therapy is also inexpensive and easy to access. Unlike many medical treatments, laughter therapy requires no drugs, surgery, or expensive equipment. All it takes is a willingness to let go of our inhibitions and embrace our sense of humor.

In conclusion, laughter is therapy for the mind and body. It can reduce stress and anxiety, boost our immune system, improve our mental health, and even help us to cope with difficult situations. Laughter therapy is an effective and low-cost way to incorporate the benefits of laughter into our lives. Whether through Laughter Yoga, group laughter sessions, or simply sharing a funny story with a friend, laughter can help us to feel happier, healthier, and more connected to the world around us.",1
131,First on CNN: CDC team studying health impacts of Ohio train derailment fell ill during investigation,"In the small town of Old Saybrook, Ohio, a train derailment occurred earlier this month, leaving many residents and local officials worried about the potential health impacts. However, what was even more concerning was the fact that the CDC team sent to investigate the incident also fell ill, causing questions to arise about the safety of the investigation process.

According to sources familiar with the situation, the CDC team was sent to Old Saybrook to assess the health impacts of the train derailment. However, during their time there, several members of the team began to display symptoms of illness, including coughing, headaches, and dizziness.

The team was subsequently withdrawn from the site, and the CDC has launched an investigation into the incident. The agency has yet to release any official statements regarding the situation, but sources close to the investigation say that there is growing concern about the safety measures in place during CDC investigations.

The train derailment occurred on the outskirts of Old Saybrook on August 7th. The train was reportedly carrying a cargo of chemicals, including benzene and toluene, both of which are known to be harmful to human health. Following the derailment, residents in the area were advised to stay indoors and close their windows as a precautionary measure.

Local officials immediately requested the assistance of the CDC, which sent a team of experts to investigate the incident. However, just days into their investigation, members of the team began to display symptoms of illness.

Speaking to CNN, a source familiar with the situation said, ""It was really worrying to see members of the CDC team falling ill like that. It's caused a lot of concern among local officials and residents in the area, who are worried about what the long-term health impacts of the derailment might be.""

The incident has raised questions about the safety measures in place during CDC investigations. While the agency is known for its expertise in public health, there are concerns that there may be gaps in its safety procedures, particularly when it comes to dealing with hazardous materials.

Speaking to CNN, Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said, ""This incident raises serious questions about the safety protocols in place for CDC investigators. If even members of the CDC team are falling ill during investigations, it suggests that there may be serious gaps in our understanding of how to handle hazardous materials.""

The incident has also highlighted the need for greater transparency when it comes to the safety measures in place during such investigations. Currently, very little is known about the safety protocols used by the CDC when dealing with hazardous materials.

""The CDC is one of the most respected public health agencies in the world, but incidents like this highlight the need for greater transparency and accountability when it comes to safety protocols in place during investigations,"" said Dr. Hotez.

The incident has also drawn attention to the potential health impacts of train derailments, particularly when they involve hazardous materials. While it is still too early to say what the long-term health impacts of the Old Saybrook incident might be, there is growing concern that such incidents could have serious health consequences.

Speaking to CNN, Dr. William Sawyer, a toxicologist and industrial hygiene consultant, said, ""Train derailments involving hazardous materials can have serious health impacts, particularly when there is exposure to chemicals like benzene and toluene. We need to be taking these incidents very seriously and ensuring that adequate safety measures are in place to protect both investigators and members of the public.""

The incident has also highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring of the health impacts of such incidents. While initial assessments of the Old Saybrook incident may have provided some insight into the immediate health impacts, there is a need for ongoing monitoring to ensure that any long-term health impacts are identified and treated appropriately.

""The health impacts of train derailments involving hazardous materials can be long-lasting and complex,"" said Dr. Sawyer. ""We need to be actively monitoring the situation to ensure that any health impacts are identified and treated appropriately.""

At present, there is no official word on when the CDC investigation into the Old Saybrook incident will resume, or what measures will be put in place to ensure the safety of investigators. However, the incident has highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability when it comes to safety protocols in place during such investigations, as well as the importance of ongoing monitoring of the health impacts of train derailments involving hazardous materials.",1
132,US inflation just reached an inflection point,"Inflation in the United States has been steadily increasing over the course of the year, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising to its highest level in over a decade. Recent data suggests that the US economy has reached an inflection point with regards to inflation, with prices now expected to rise at a faster rate than previously anticipated. In this article, we will examine the current state of inflation in the US, its underlying causes, and the implications of this change for consumers, businesses, and the broader economy.

The CPI, which measures the prices of a basket of goods and services that are commonly purchased by consumers, has risen by 5.4% in the past year. This is well above the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2% and represents the fastest pace of inflation since August 2008. The rise in prices is largely attributed to supply chain disruptions and shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. As the world economy has rebounded from the pandemic, demand for goods and services has outstripped supply, leading to higher prices for consumers.

However, recent data suggests that the inflationary pressures in the US economy are unlikely to abate anytime soon. The latest projections from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis suggest that inflation will remain above 2.5% for the next three years. This marks a significant shift in the way that economists are thinking about inflation in the post-pandemic world.

One of the factors contributing to this change is the persistence of supply chain disruptions. While many businesses have begun to recover from the initial shock of the pandemic, there are still major bottlenecks and shortages in certain sectors of the economy. These have been compounded by disruptions in global shipping and logistics, which have made it more difficult to move goods across borders. As a result, businesses are facing higher costs, and these costs are being passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Another factor contributing to the rise in inflation is the surge in demand for goods and services as the economy reopens. Consumers have been eager to return to restaurants, travel, and attend events after more than a year of lockdowns and restrictions. This rush of demand, combined with supply chain bottlenecks, has created a situation where businesses can charge more for their goods and services, knowing that consumers are willing to pay a premium for them.

The implications of this inflection point in inflation are significant, both for consumers and businesses. For consumers, the rising prices mean that their purchasing power is decreasing, and they may need to make difficult choices about which goods and services they can afford. For low-income households, this could lead to increased financial insecurity, as they struggle to make ends meet. For businesses, the rising costs of raw materials and labor could squeeze profit margins, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. This could lead to job losses and lower economic growth, as businesses cut back on investment and expansion.

The Federal Reserve has been closely monitoring the inflationary pressures in the economy and has signaled that it may begin to raise interest rates sooner than previously anticipated. This would make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, which could slow down economic activity and help to bring inflation under control. However, raising interest rates too quickly or too aggressively could also lead to a recession or economic downturn.

One of the challenges facing policymakers is the fact that inflation is not evenly distributed across the economy. Some sectors, such as housing and healthcare, have seen much lower rates of inflation than others, such as food and energy. This means that any policies aimed at controlling inflation will have differential impacts on different groups of consumers and businesses. There are also concerns that raising interest rates could disproportionately affect low-income households and those with high levels of debt, as they would be the most affected by higher borrowing costs.

In the short term, there is unlikely to be a quick fix for the inflationary pressures in the US economy. The supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks may persist for some time, and the surge in demand for goods and services is unlikely to abate anytime soon. However, policymakers will need to take action to address these issues and prevent inflation from spiraling out of control. This may include measures to increase the supply of goods and services, such as investments in infrastructure and workforce development, as well as policies aimed at moderating demand, such as tax incentives and rebates for energy-efficient products.

However, the inflationary pressures in the US economy are also symptomatic of broader structural issues, such as rising income inequality, declining productivity, and the impact of globalization. Addressing these underlying issues will require more fundamental policy changes, such as investments in education and training, strengthening worker protections and rights, and increasing access to affordable healthcare and housing.

In conclusion, the rise in inflation in the United States has reached an inflection point, with prices expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. This poses significant challenges for policymakers, consumers, and businesses, and will require a complex and nuanced policy response. While there are no simple solutions, it is essential that policymakers act quickly and decisively to address these challenges and prevent inflation from spiraling out of control.",1
133,"Late-stage RSV vaccine trials show 'exciting promise,' some scientists say","Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that causes infections in the lungs and breathing passages. In healthy adults, RSV is generally considered a mild illness, causing symptoms similar to the common cold. However, for infants, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems, RSV can lead to severe respiratory symptoms and even death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), RSV is responsible for approximately 57,000 hospitalizations and 2.1 million outpatient visits among children younger than five years old in the United States each year.

For decades, scientists have been working to develop a vaccine to prevent RSV infections, but unfortunately, efforts have been challenging due to the virus's unique properties. Early clinical trials of RSV vaccines showed some promise, but ultimately, they failed to produce a viable vaccine.

Now, researchers are showing renewed optimism as late-stage clinical trials for new RSV vaccines demonstrate exciting promise. These vaccines use a novel approach, targeting the RSV F protein, which is essential for the virus's ability to infect cells. The research is the latest evidence that vaccine development is beginning to show some ingenuity and creativity while advancing the fight against infectious diseases.

""We're very excited about the potential of these RSV vaccines,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. ""The technology behind them is quite different from previous attempts, and the results we've seen so far are incredibly encouraging.""

One of the most advanced RSV vaccines currently in development is called RSVpreF. The vaccine is being developed by Pfizer and Belgian pharmaceutical company, BioNTech. The RSVpreF vaccine is based on BioNTech's mRNA technology, which has gained prominence for its role in developing the COVID-19 vaccine.

Unlike traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines take advantage of the body's cellular machinery. They teach cells to produce a specific protein that triggers an immune system response. In the case of the RSVpreF vaccine, researchers developed an mRNA sequence that instructs cells to produce a modified version of the RSV F protein. When the immune system detects this protein, it mounts an immune response, which helps to protect against RSV infections.

The Phase 2 clinical trial of the RSVpreF vaccine has shown promising results. The vaccine induced high levels of antibodies against RSV in all age groups tested, including older adults. The trial also demonstrated that the vaccine is well-tolerated and does not cause any significant adverse effects.

Another RSV vaccine in development is the GSK3888550A vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline. The vaccine uses a different approach, targeting the RSV G protein. In preclinical trials, the vaccine has shown promising results, providing protection against RSV infections in animal models. The vaccine is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, and results are expected later this year.

While scientists are cautiously optimistic about the RSV vaccine's potential, they acknowledge that challenges remain. Developing a vaccine that provides long-lasting protection against RSV has been challenging, as the virus can quickly mutate and evade the immune system's defenses.

""The RSV virus is notorious for being elusive,"" said Dr. James Crowe, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""It's like chasing a moving target, and we need to be mindful of that as we continue to develop new vaccines.""

Another challenge is the lack of a reliable biomarker to measure the vaccine's efficacy. Traditional markers, such as antibody levels, can be misleading in the case of RSV vaccines, as they may not provide a complete picture of the vaccine's protective capacity.

""The RSV virus is unique in that it can reinfect individuals multiple times,"" said Dr. Pedro Piedra, a professor of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine. ""So, we need to be able to measure the vaccine's efficacy beyond just antibody levels to assess long-term protection.""

Despite these challenges, there is reason to be optimistic. Advances in vaccine technology, coupled with increased funding and collaboration among researchers, have led to some significant breakthroughs in infectious disease prevention.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of vaccines and the need for continued innovation in vaccine development,"" said Dr. Perlman. ""We're seeing some exciting progress in the development of RSV vaccines, and we're hopeful that these vaccines will one day help protect vulnerable populations from this serious respiratory illness.""

The need for a vaccine to prevent RSV infections is urgent, particularly for young children and the elderly. Severe RSV infections can lead to respiratory failure and require hospitalization, putting a significant strain on healthcare systems worldwide. The economic burden of RSV infections is also substantial, with estimated annual costs of over $5 billion in the United States alone.

The hope is that effective RSV vaccines will help reduce the number of hospitalizations and healthcare costs associated with RSV infections, ultimately saving lives and improving public health.

""The potential impact of an effective RSV vaccine cannot be overstated,"" said Dr. Piedra. ""It would be a game-changer in the fight against respiratory illnesses and could help prevent significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations.""

In conclusion, the RSV vaccine is showing promising results in late-stage clinical trials. The technology behind these vaccines is different from previous attempts, and the early results suggest that they may be much more effective. Governments and public health organizations must continue to fund and support vaccine research, for RSV and other infectious diseases, to ensure continued progress in disease prevention and treatment. The development of a successful RSV vaccine could have a significant impact on improving public health globally.",1

135,Sarah Paulson financially helped friend Pedro Pascal early in his career,"Sarah Paulson is a Hollywood actress known for her impressive acting skills on stage, TV, and film. She has received numerous awards for her remarkable performances and continues to showcase her acting prowess in various projects. But besides her successful career, Paulson also has a big heart and has recently revealed that she financially helped her friend Pedro Pascal at the beginning of his career.

Pedro Pascal is also a famous actor, widely recognized for his roles in Games of Thrones, Narcos, and The Mandalorian. However, before he gained recognition in the industry, Pascal was struggling financially. In a recent interview, Sarah Paulson spoke about how she had helped him at the time. She revealed that when she first met him, he would always talk about how he was struggling to make ends meet.

""I remember once, he was talking about not being able to pay his rent. I just immediately got out my checkbook and wrote him a check that covered like three months of rent, and I said, 'You just cannot have this worry. Let me do this for you. You can't focus on the work that you wanna do if you're constantly thinking about these other things'."" Paulson said.

Her act of generosity came at a time when Pascal was struggling to find jobs, and he was skeptical about whether he would succeed in the acting industry. Paulson's gift seemed to have been the little push he needed to continue pursuing his passion for acting. Today, Pascal is a successful actor with a net worth of $10 million, and he credits his friend's generosity for helping him during his early days as an actor.

In an interview with Howard Stern, Pascal spoke about Paulson's act of kindness, saying ""There was a moment when I was out of work for a long time and not sure if I would ever work again. And she wrote me a check that helped me pay my rent. I remember thinking that was extraordinary.""

The financial help Paulson provided Pascal might have somewhat set him on the path to success, and the two remain good friends to date. The two have worked together on various projects, and it's no secret that their friendship has only gotten stronger.

Paulson is known for being a kind person and has a history of generosity towards her friends. Earlier this year, she also talked about how she helped her friend Amanda Peet, an actress, and writer, by being her babysitter. Peet told Paulson that she was going through a difficult time, juggling work and parenting, and that’s when Sarah offered to babysit Peet's kids, allowing her to work on her projects without worrying about her kids.

Sarah Paulson is not only known for her talent but also for her kindness and generosity towards her friends. Her act of kindness towards Pedro Pascal is just one example of how one good deed can go a long way in helping somebody achieve their dreams. Her kindness and generosity towards her colleagues, friends, and acquaintances have touched many hearts, and she continues to inspire people with her acts of kindness.",1
136,"5 things to know for April 11: Louisville shooting, Covid, Fungus, Ukraine, Dalai Lama","Louisville saw another night of violence as demonstrators took to the streets to protest the fatal police shooting of a black man, Daunte Wright, in Minnesota. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues to affect daily life across the globe, with a new fungus causing concern in India, and tensions rising between Ukraine and Russia. Here are 5 things you need to know for April 11:

1. Louisville police shooting reignites protests
Protests erupted in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday night following the police shooting of a man during a traffic stop earlier in the day. The victim, identified by family members as David McAtee, had been the owner of a barbecue restaurant in the area. Police say that the officers were responding to gunfire when they came in contact with McAtee, who had reportedly fired his gun before they arrived. A video of the incident shows several people standing outside the restaurant before police open fire. The shooting is now under investigation, and the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave.

2. Covid-19 update
The coronavirus pandemic continues to impact the world, with over 135 million reported cases and 2.9 million deaths worldwide. India is currently facing a surge in cases, with more than 169,000 new infections reported on Sunday alone. The country's healthcare system is overwhelmed, with hospitals running out of oxygen and beds. Meanwhile, the US has reported over 31 million cases and 562,000 deaths. The country continues to see high levels of vaccine distribution, with more than 120 million doses administered so far.

3. New fungus causes concern in India
A new strain of fungus, known as ""black fungus,"" is causing concern in India as the country grapples with a surge in Covid-19 cases. The fungus, also known as mucormycosis, can cause serious infections in people with weakened immune systems. It can enter the body through the nose and eyes and spread to other parts of the body, including the brain. Doctors in India have reported a surge in cases in Covid-19 patients, with around 220 cases reported in Maharashtra state alone. Treatment can be difficult, with antifungal medication sometimes ineffective. The fungus is not contagious and is not related to Covid-19.

4. Tensions rise between Ukraine and Russia
Tensions are rising between Ukraine and Russia following the buildup of Russian military forces near the Ukrainian border. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed concerns about the situation, calling on NATO and Western countries to take ""urgent"" action. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine and claims that the military buildup is part of a routine exercise. However, the situation has caused concern among Ukraine's Western allies, who fear that Russia may be preparing for military action. The US and European Union have both expressed support for Ukraine, which has been in conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country's east since 2014.

5. Dalai Lama receives Covid-19 vaccine in India
The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet, received his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday in northern India. The Dalai Lama reportedly encouraged others to get vaccinated, saying that ""this injection is very, very helpful."" The 85-year-old leader has been living in India since fleeing his homeland in 1959 amid a Chinese crackdown on Tibet. India has been administering vaccines to its population since January, with around 100 million doses administered so far.

Overall, tensions continue to rise around the world as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact daily life. The surge in cases in India and the emergence of new and concerning strains of the virus highlight the need for continued vigilance and precautions. The situation in Ukraine is also a reminder of the ongoing geopolitical challenges faced by many countries, particularly those in conflict zones. And as the protests and violence continue in the US, the country is also grappling with its own social and political challenges. As always, it is important to stay informed and engaged, particularly as we seek to navigate these complex and ever-changing times.",1

138,Three major risks that have the banking industry on edge,"As the world becomes more and more interconnected, the risks facing the banking industry continue to multiply. With new threats emerging on a regular basis, financial institutions need to be more vigilant than ever in order to protect themselves and their customers.

Here are three of the biggest risks that have the banking industry on edge.

1. Cybersecurity

As more financial transactions move online, the banking industry has become an increasingly attractive target for cybercriminals. In recent years, we've seen several high-profile data breaches affecting major banks and other financial institutions.

These attacks not only put customer data at risk but can also bring entire systems down, causing widespread disruption and damage to the financial sector.

To combat this threat, financial institutions have invested heavily in cybersecurity measures. This includes both technical solutions like firewalls and encryption as well as training for employees to help them recognize and respond to potential threats.

Despite these efforts, cybercriminals continue to find ways to breach systems and steal data. As technology advances and new attack methods are developed, the banking industry must remain vigilant in order to stay one step ahead of potential threats.

2. Economic Volatility

The global financial system is inherently unpredictable, with a wide range of factors affecting economic stability. From geopolitical tensions to natural disasters to sudden shifts in consumer behavior, there are many variables that can impact the banking industry.

One of the most significant recent examples of this volatility was the 2008 financial crisis, which was triggered by a combination of factors including a housing market bubble and widespread investment in risky subprime mortgages.

In response to this type of unpredictability, financial institutions have put more emphasis on risk management and regulatory compliance. However, even with these measures in place, the potential for upheaval remains a looming threat.

With ongoing trade tensions between major global powers and other destabilizing factors in play, the banking industry must remain attentive to economic trends and mitigate risks whenever possible.

3. Regulatory Changes

As governments across the world look to prevent future financial crises, they have implemented a range of new regulations affecting the banking industry. From Basel III banking standards to the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States, these regulations aim to strengthen financial stability and protect consumers.

However, while these efforts are well-intentioned, they can also create new challenges for financial institutions. Compliance with complex regulatory frameworks can be time-consuming and costly, diverting resources away from other critical areas.

Moreover, regulatory changes can also limit the flexibility of banks and other institutions, making it more difficult to respond to shifting market conditions and consumer demands.

To stay ahead of these challenges, successful financial institutions will need to take a proactive approach. This includes staying up to date with regulatory changes, leveraging technology to streamline compliance efforts, and establishing strong relationships with relevant government agencies.

In Conclusion

The banking industry is facing a range of significant risks, from cybersecurity threats to economic volatility to ongoing regulatory changes. In order to succeed in this rapidly-evolving landscape, financial institutions must continuously monitor these risks, adapt to changing conditions, and be vigilant in their efforts to protect customer data and financial stability.

By staying informed and taking a proactive approach, both banks and their customers can be better prepared for the unpredictable nature of the global economy.",1
139,"These 5 rules for good sleep may also impact development of asthma, experts say","As if the benefits of a good night's sleep weren't enough, a recent study suggests that following five specific rules for better sleep hygiene may also have a positive impact on the development of asthma.

The study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, analyzed data from more than 20,000 adults in Europe, looking at their sleep habits and respiratory health. Researchers found that individuals who adhered to the following five rules for good sleep hygiene had a 34% lower risk of developing asthma:

1. Going to bed at a similar time each night
2. Sleeping for at least 7-8 hours per night
3. Not being a night owl (i.e., late bedtime and waking time)
4. Not having difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep
5. Not feeling sleepy during the day

""Overall, our study suggests that maintaining good sleep hygiene may reduce the risk of developing asthma,"" lead author Dr. Linn Beate Strand said in a statement.

The findings add to a growing body of research linking sleep and respiratory health. Previous studies have suggested that poor sleep quality can exacerbate respiratory conditions like asthma, and that sleep apnea—a condition characterized by disrupted breathing during sleep—may increase the risk of developing asthma.

But the new study offers some hope that good sleep hygiene may be a preventive measure for those at risk of developing asthma. And while the study doesn't prove causation—i.e., that following these sleep rules directly leads to a reduced risk of asthma—it does suggest that there's a strong association worth exploring further.

So what exactly do these sleep hygiene rules entail, and how might they impact respiratory health? Let's break it down:

1. Go to bed at a similar time each night

While late nights and sleeping in on the weekends might sound appealing, our bodies thrive on routine when it comes to sleep. Going to bed at a similar time each night helps regulate our circadian rhythms—the internal ""clock"" that helps dictate when we feel awake and when we feel sleepy. Disrupting that rhythm by staying up late or sleeping in can throw off our body's natural sleep-wake cycle, potentially leading to poor sleep quality and, in turn, respiratory issues like asthma.

2. Sleep for at least 7-8 hours per night

This one might seem obvious, but it's easier said than done for many of us. While some people may feel fine on less sleep, research shows that most adults need between 7-9 hours of sleep per night to function optimally. Getting less than that can affect cognitive function, mood, and physical health—including, potentially, respiratory health.

3. Don't be a night owl (i.e., late bedtime and waking time)

Staying up late and sleeping in might seem like a luxury, but research suggests that being a ""night owl"" may be associated with a host of health problems—including respiratory issues like asthma. That's because staying up late can throw off our circadian rhythms, potentially leading to poor sleep quality and respiratory problems down the line.

4. Don't have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep

It's estimated that up to a third of adults struggle with insomnia—defined as difficulty falling or staying asleep. Not only can this lead to feelings of fatigue and irritability, but it can also affect physical health—including respiratory health. That's because poor sleep quality can exacerbate respiratory issues like asthma, potentially making symptoms worse.

5. Don't feel sleepy during the day

We all have days where we feel a little groggy or tired, but feeling sleepy during the day on a regular basis can be a sign of poor sleep quality or other underlying health issues. Not only can daytime sleepiness affect work performance and mood, but it can also be a sign of respiratory problems like sleep apnea—which has been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma.

Of course, following these sleep hygiene rules won't necessarily guarantee that you won't develop asthma—or any other health problem, for that matter. But the new study suggests that good sleep hygiene may be a valuable tool in reducing the risk of respiratory issues like asthma.

So if asthma—or any other respiratory condition—is a concern for you, it might be worth paying a little extra attention to your sleep habits. Stick to a regular bedtime and waking time, prioritize getting enough sleep each night, and address any issues (like insomnia or sleep apnea) that might be affecting your sleep quality. Your respiratory health—and overall well-being—may thank you.",1
140,"Cash App founder Bob Lee knew the suspect in his stabbing death, police say","The founder of Cash App, Bob Lee, was fatally stabbed to death on Sunday and police say that the suspect was someone he knew.

Lee, who was being referred to as an innovator in his field by his colleagues, was found by his girlfriend in his apartment in New York City's Lower East Side with multiple stab wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to the police, twenty-one-year-old Jehlon Robinson, who is known to Lee, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder. Robinson reportedly fled the scene on foot, but was later arrested by the authorities.

The motive for the stabbing remains unclear, but reports suggest that it could be connected to a feud that had been developing between the two men for some time. Lee's girlfriend told the police that Robinson had been acting strange in the days leading up to the incident and had even sent Lee threatening messages.

Cash App, which is a mobile payment platform that allows users to send and receive money from their smartphones, has quickly become one of the most popular apps of its kind. It was founded in 2013 by Lee, who had previously worked at Google and Yahoo. He was widely regarded as a pioneer in the fintech industry and had received numerous awards for his work.

Following his death, tributes have poured in from around the world. Many of Lee's former colleagues have expressed their shock and sadness at the news, describing him as a ""brilliant mind"" who had ""changed the game"" when it came to online payments.

Cash App's parent company, Square, also released a statement in which they paid tribute to Lee, saying that he had ""made a tremendous impact not only on our company but on the lives of our customers as well.""

Lee's death has once again put the spotlight on the issue of violence in America's major cities. New York has seen a surge in violent crime in recent years, with many experts pointing to a range of factors including rising income inequality, a lack of affordable housing, and the proliferation of guns on the streets.

Despite these challenges, many in the fintech industry remain committed to building a more equitable and just society. They see their work as a way to empower people who have been left behind by traditional financial institutions and to create opportunities for all.

As the investigation into Lee's death continues, his colleagues and friends are left mourning the loss of a true visionary who had an unwavering commitment to his work and his community.",1
141,Manhattan median rents hit another high in March,"Manhattan Median Rents Hit Another High in March

The median rents for apartments in Manhattan have hit a new high in March, according to the latest data. This marks the second consecutive month that rents have hit record highs.

The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan now stands at $3,476, up 1.8% from February. Meanwhile, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment is now $4,522, an increase of 2.2%.

These figures were released by Zumper, a real estate database company that tracks rental prices in major cities across the United States. According to their data, the current rental prices in Manhattan are the highest they have ever been.

This news will likely come as a disappointment for renters in the city, who are already struggling to keep up with the high cost of living. The pandemic has had a major impact on the city’s economy, with many people either losing their jobs or experiencing a decline in income.

As a result, some landlords have been forced to offer concessions to renters in order to keep their units occupied. These concessions include things like free months of rent or waiving broker fees. However, the new data suggests that these concessions may be becoming less common.

So, what is driving the increase in rents? According to market experts, it is a combination of factors. Firstly, there has been an increase in demand for apartments in Manhattan as the city starts to recover from the pandemic. Many people are returning to the city after spending time in the suburbs or other areas.

In addition, there has been a shortage of available units in Manhattan, which has driven up prices. The pandemic has led to a decrease in new construction projects in the city, meaning that there are fewer new apartments available on the market.

Meanwhile, the rollout of vaccines has raised hopes for a return to normalcy in the near future, which has led some people to start looking for new apartments. This has further increased demand for rental units and driven up prices.

For now, it appears that rental prices in Manhattan are likely to continue to climb. Experts predict that the trend will continue for the foreseeable future unless there is a significant change in the city’s economy or construction industry.

For renters, this means that finding an affordable apartment in Manhattan will continue to be a challenge. Tenants may need to get creative in order to find ways to save money, whether that means negotiating with landlords or seeking out more affordable neighborhoods.

Overall, the latest data on Manhattan’s median rents confirms what many renters already know – it is an expensive city to live in. While there are certainly benefits to living in Manhattan, such as access to culture, entertainment, and job opportunities, the cost of living can be a significant burden.

As the city continues to recover from the pandemic and more people return to the area, it will be interesting to see whether rental prices continue to climb or if the trend begins to reverse. For now, however, renters will need to brace themselves for higher prices and tough competition in the market.",1
142,"New Jersey wildfire 75% contained as all roads to reopen soon, officials say","New Jersey wildfire 75% contained as all roads to reopen soon, officials say

A wildfire in New Jersey has been contained by 75%, according to officials. The blaze, which started on Sunday afternoon, has so far destroyed over 7,000 acres of land in the southern part of the state.

Officials say all major roads that were closed due to the wildfire are set to reopen soon. However, they are still urging drivers in the area to be careful as the fire is not yet fully contained.

The wildfire started around 2 p.m. on Sunday afternoon in the area of Bass River State Forest. The fire spread quickly due to dry conditions and strong winds, causing several roads to close and the evacuation of around 50 homes in the nearby vicinity.

But thanks to the efforts of the firefighters, the wildfire is 75% contained as of Tuesday morning, announced the New Jersey State Forest Fire Service. It did not say how many acres were still burning.

“Firefighters continue to work aggressively, but the area of active burning has been decreased,” officials said.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities.

The state forest fire service has been assisted by firefighters from other nearby states, including Pennsylvania and New York, since Sunday. The New Jersey National Guard also deployed a Blackhawk helicopter equipped with a water bucket to help fight the blaze.

Several factors have contributed to the ease of the fire, including cooler temperatures, lower humidity, and a change in wind direction, according to New Jersey Forest Fire Service spokesman Rob Geist.

“All these factors have come together that have really allowed us to make progress the last couple of days,” Geist said.

As of Tuesday, about 90 firefighters were still working to extinguish the blaze.

Although some residents were allowed to return to their homes on Monday, officials warn that the fire is not yet fully extinguished and advised those in the area to remain vigilant.

“We want people to be aware and cautious until the fire is completely out,” said Steve Schapiro, Assistant Commissioner for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.

The state's Department of Environmental Protection has also issued an air quality alert due to the smoke from the fire. It urged residents to limit their outdoor activities and those with respiratory issues to stay indoors.

The New Jersey Department of Transportation said all major highways and roads that were closed due to the fire would be reopened soon. However, they are still urging drivers to be cautious in the area as the wildfire is not yet fully contained.

The blaze is just one of dozens of wildfires that have raged across the western United States in recent weeks, fueled by hot, dry conditions brought on by climate change.

Gov. Phil Murphy said the situation showed that climate change is a “real and urgent threat” to New Jersey and the entire country.

“This is a vivid reminder that climate change is real and it’s here to stay,” Murphy said. “We have to take this seriously.”

Although the wildfire is 75% contained and roads are set to reopen soon, officials are still urging those in the area to be cautious and vigilant. They also ask that residents do their part to prevent further wildfires by not throwing cigarettes or other flammable materials out of their cars and properly disposing of campfires and grills.

“This is a reminder that wildfires can still occur,"" Schapiro said. ""We need to prepare for them and make sure we take the steps necessary to prevent them from happening in the first place.""",1

145,"5 things to know for April 10: Document leaks, Mosque stabbing, Abortion, EVs, Masters","As we head into the weekend, here are the five things you need to know for April 10th.

1. Document Leaks
The world of journalism is buzzing today after the release of more than 700 pages of documents related to the detention and treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay. The documents were leaked to news organizations including the New York Times, the Guardian, and German public broadcaster NDR by an anonymous source. They offer a rare insight into the inner workings of the controversial detention center, which has been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism since its inception after the September 11th attacks. The documents provide information about the detainees' physical and mental health, as well as details about their interrogations and the conditions in which they are housed. The release of the documents is sure to reignite the debate about the use of Guantanamo Bay as a detention center for suspected terrorists and the treatment of detainees held there.

2. Mosque Stabbing
In a tragic incident in the UK, a police officer was killed and several others injured after a man stabbed them in and around a mosque in Birmingham. The suspect, a 27-year-old man, is in custody and has been detained under the UK's Mental Health Act. The incident is being treated as a terrorist attack, and the police say they are not looking for any other suspects. The attack has been condemned by political leaders across the spectrum, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying his ""thoughts are with the injured and all those affected."" The incident comes just days after a terrorist attack in London in which a man drove a car into pedestrians and then stabbed a police officer to death, before being shot and killed by police.

3. Abortion
The US Supreme Court has announced that it will take up a major abortion case that could have significant implications for the future of reproductive rights in the country. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, centers on a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The law was signed by the state's Republican governor in 2018, but it was immediately challenged by the state's only abortion clinic, which argued that it was unconstitutional. Lower courts have so far blocked the law from taking effect, but now the Supreme Court will have the final say. The case will be heard in the fall, with a decision likely to come next year. Many activists on both sides of the abortion debate are watching the case closely, as it could provide an opportunity for the court to overturn or significantly weaken Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.

4. EVs
Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to be a hot topic as carmakers race to develop new models and infrastructure to support them. This week, General Motors announced its plans to have 30 all-electric models globally by 2025, with the aim of selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. The move is part of the company's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and become carbon neutral by 2040. Meanwhile, Tesla has been in the news after reports that the company has been investigating a fatal crash involving one of its cars in Texas. No definitive cause has been established, but there are concerns that the car's Autopilot system may have been involved. The incident is likely to fuel the ongoing debate about the safety of self-driving cars and the role of automation in the transportation sector.

5. Masters
Finally, sports fans around the world are turning their attention to Augusta, Georgia this weekend for the start of the Masters golf tournament. The event, considered one of the sport's biggest and most prestigious, was postponed from its usual April slot last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This year's tournament will be played without fans but will still feature many of the sport's biggest names, including world number one Dustin Johnson, defending champion Tiger Woods (who is recovering from a serious car crash), and former champions Phil Mickelson and Jordan Spieth. The Masters is known for its tradition and pageantry as much as its golf, with the famous green jacket awarded to the winner and the iconic Augusta National Golf Club providing a stunning backdrop for the action. The tournament runs through Sunday.

That's it for now. Have a great weekend!",1
146,"Emergency room visits from firearms dropped in 2022, but remained higher than pre-pandemic rate","According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency room visits from firearms dropped significantly in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, the number remained higher than the pre-pandemic rate.

The CDC defines an emergency department visit as being firearm-related when ""the primary mechanism of injury or the underlying cause of injury is a firearm, such as a bullet or pellets from a shotgun."" Such visits can include both intentional and unintentional shootings, as well as injuries resulting from the use of a firearm in a crime, self-harm incidents, or accidents.

In 2022, the number of emergency department visits for firearm-related injuries was approximately 78,000 — a decrease of around 10% from the previous year. The decline was largely driven by a reduction in the number of unintentional shootings among children and teens, as well as a decrease in self-harm incidents. However, the number of visits remained higher than the pre-pandemic rate, indicating that firearm-related injuries continue to be a pressing concern in U.S. society.

Dr. David Hemenway, professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, believes the high number of emergency department visits for firearm-related injuries is due, in part, to the prevalence of firearms in American society.

""Unfortunately, because there are so many guns, we're going to continue to have a lot of injuries, and many of them are going to be in the form of suicide,"" he said.

Several other factors may also contribute to the high number of firearm-related injuries in the United States. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the vast majority of firearm-related deaths among children and adolescents are attributed to unintentional shootings. The organization recommends that parents and caregivers take steps to prevent access to firearms in the home, as well as to educate children about gun safety.

In addition to prevention efforts, advocates of gun control legislation have called for stronger regulations around the sale, distribution, and use of firearms in America. These advocates argue that tighter regulations will help to reduce the number of incidents involving firearms and ensure that those individuals who are at risk for harming themselves or others are prevented from obtaining firearms.

Despite these efforts, however, gun violence continues to be a pervasive issue in American society. In recent years, mass shootings and other high-profile incidents of gun violence have sparked national debates about gun control legislation, mental health, and the role of public safety officials in preventing such tragedies.

Some experts suggest that addressing gun violence will require a holistic approach that addresses the underlying causes of such incidents. For example, some have called for increased funding for mental health treatment and support services, as well as increased investment in community-based programs that seek to address issues like poverty and social isolation.

Others point to the need for more research into the factors that contribute to gun violence, as well as the effectiveness of different intervention strategies. In recent years, the federal government has taken steps to increase funding for gun violence research, but many argue that more needs to be done to fully understand and address the issue.

While emergency department visits related to firearms have decreased from the peak levels seen in 2021, the fact that they remain higher than pre-pandemic levels suggests that gun violence continues to be a significant public health challenge in the United States. As policymakers and public health experts continue to debate the best ways to address this issue, it is clear that more work is needed to prevent gun-related injuries and deaths in our communities.",1

148,Fort Lauderdale airport to remain closed until Friday morning after the rainiest day in the city's history causes severe flooding,"Fort Lauderdale airport, the primary airport serving the Miami metropolitan area, will remain closed until Friday morning due to severe flooding caused by the rainiest day in the city's history. The airport initially closed on Thursday due to the flooding, which caused significant disruptions to flights and stranded thousands of passengers.

The National Weather Service reported that Fort Lauderdale saw over 14 inches of rain over a 24-hour period, breaking the previous record of 9.6 inches set in 1991. The heavy rain caused significant flooding across the city, including at the airport, which sits just a few miles from the coast.

Videos posted on social media showed cars submerged in water while passengers waded through the flooded airport terminal. The airport's parking lot was also severely flooded, with cars partially underwater and some completely submerged.

In a statement released on Twitter, the airport said that it was ""experiencing significant flooding throughout the facilities"" and urged passengers to check with their airlines for the latest flight information. The airport also said that it was working with local authorities to address the flooding and ensure the safety of passengers and employees.

Despite efforts to alleviate the flooding, officials decided to keep the airport closed until Friday morning. According to the airport's website, more than 300 flights had been canceled as of Thursday evening, affecting thousands of passengers.

Passengers affected by the airport closure were advised to contact their airlines for rebooking options or to rebook online. Airlines serving Fort Lauderdale airport, including American Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, and Spirit Airlines, have issued travel advisories and offered fee waivers for affected passengers.

In addition to the airport closure, the flooding caused significant disruptions to traffic across the city. Several major roads were closed due to flooding, and the city's public transportation system was also affected.

The city of Fort Lauderdale issued a statement on Thursday urging residents to stay home and avoid unnecessary travel due to the flooding. The statement also warned of potential power outages and advised residents to prepare for the possibility of flooding in their homes.

The heavy rainfall is believed to be due to a combination of factors, including a stalled frontal boundary and a high level of moisture in the air. According to the National Weather Service, there is a slight chance of additional rainfall in the area over the next few days, but it is not expected to be as heavy as Thursday's rainfall.

The flooding at Fort Lauderdale airport is just the latest in a series of weather-related disruptions to air travel in the United States this year. In February, a winter storm caused significant flight disruptions across the central and eastern United States, while wildfires in California in November forced the closure of several airports in the region.

The frequency and severity of weather-related disruptions to air travel is likely to increase in the coming years, according to a recent study by the International Air Transport Association. The study found that extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, are becoming more common due to climate change, and are likely to disrupt air travel more frequently in the future.

The study also found that airlines and airports are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of weather-related disruptions, which can cause significant financial costs and reputational damage. The report recommended that airlines and airports take steps to improve their resilience to extreme weather events, including investing in better weather forecasting and developing contingency plans to respond to disruptions.

While it remains to be seen how airlines and airports will respond to the challenges of climate change and extreme weather events, the recent disruptions at Fort Lauderdale airport serve as a warning of the potential impacts of these phenomena on air travel. As the effects of climate change continue to be felt across the globe, it is likely that the frequency and severity of weather-related disruptions to air travel will only increase in the years to come.",1
149,"'Paint' feels like a trailer in search of a movie, with Owen Wilson as a Bob Ross-type artist","In the latest Netflix original movie, ""Paint,"" Owen Wilson plays a Bob Ross-type artist named Bill Wesley, who has a hit television show where he teaches viewers how to paint.

However, ""Paint"" feels like a trailer in search of a movie. While the premise has potential, the film fails to live up to it. The plot centers around Bill struggling to finish his final episode of the season, but there are too many unclear and unnecessary plotlines that detract from the main conflict.

The film introduces subplots, such as Bill's rocky relationship with his ex-wife (played by Amy Poehler) and his strained relationship with his production team, which do little to add depth to the story. In fact, the majority of the characters in the film are underdeveloped and fail to capture the audience's interest.

The film also struggles with pacing, with the plot meandering from one subplot to another without a clear focus or direction. This results in a disjointed narrative that feels unfinished and unsatisfying.

Despite the film's flaws, Wilson delivers a solid performance as the affable and charming Bill Wesley. He captures the essence of Bob Ross, with his soft-spoken demeanor and gentle encouragement to his viewers. However, even Wilson's performance cannot save the film from its shortcomings.

Visually, ""Paint"" is stunning, with beautiful landscapes and serene settings that complement the meditative nature of painting. The film's cinematography and art direction are well-executed, but they are not enough to make up for the lackluster plot.

Overall, ""Paint"" is a missed opportunity. This film had the potential to be a heartwarming and uplifting story, but it ultimately falls short. The film feels like a collection of ideas that were not fully fleshed out, resulting in a disjointed narrative that fails to engage the audience.

At times, ""Paint"" feels like it's trying to be a parody of Bob Ross and his iconic painting show. However, it never fully commits to this idea, resulting in a film that feels incomplete and unsatisfying.

In conclusion, while Owen Wilson delivers a solid performance as the Bob Ross-type artist in ""Paint,"" the film falls short in its execution. The plot is muddled with unnecessary subplots, and the pacing is disjointed, resulting in a film that feels like a trailer in search of a movie.",1

152,"A man with schizophrenia died after being kept naked and malnourished in solitary confinement at an Indiana jail for nearly 3 weeks, lawsuit says","A man with schizophrenia died in 2019 after being kept naked and malnourished in solitary confinement at an Indiana jail for nearly three weeks, according to a lawsuit filed by his family.

The lawsuit, filed last week in the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, alleges that Austin Myers, 26, was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, denied medical care, and deprived of basic necessities.

Myers was arrested on October 1, 2019, for burglary and was placed in solitary confinement at the Madison County Jail. According to the lawsuit, he was stripped of his clothing, denied bedding, and given only a small mat to sleep on. He was also denied access to showers, fresh clothes, and basic hygiene products, the lawsuit alleges.

Myers was also allegedly deprived of food and water. According to the lawsuit, he lost around 20 pounds during his 20 days in solitary confinement. His family alleges that Myers was suffering from schizophrenia, and jail staff were aware of his mental illness.

Despite his obvious deterioration, the lawsuit alleges that Myers was denied medical care. On October 19, Myers was found unresponsive in his cell and was pronounced dead shortly afterward. The lawsuit alleges that he died from dehydration, malnutrition, and a lack of medical care.

The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages, alleges that the jail staff was indifferent to Myers’ well-being and knowingly subjected him to inhumane treatment.

“While in custody, Mr. Myers was dehumanized and subjected to cruel and unusual punishment,” the lawsuit states. “He was left to languish in an isolation cell with no clothing, no bedding, and no access to basic necessities such as food, water, hygiene products, and medical care.”

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office, which operates the jail, has not yet commented on the lawsuit. However, they did release a statement in 2019 following Myers’ death in which they stated that they were conducting an internal investigation.

“The Madison County Sheriff’s Office takes the care of its inmates seriously and has implemented policies and procedures to ensure the safety and well-being of inmates,” the statement read. “The Sheriff’s Office is cooperating fully with the investigation into Mr. Myers’ death.”

The lawsuit is the latest in a string of cases highlighting the dangers of solitary confinement, particularly for individuals with mental illness. A report by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that people with mental health conditions are disproportionately placed in solitary confinement and are at greater risk of suicide.

The ACLU report also found that isolation can exacerbate mental illness symptoms and lead to trauma. The report recommends that solitary confinement should be used only as a last resort and for the shortest time possible.

“The use of solitary confinement can have profound psychological and physical consequences, particularly for individuals with mental health conditions,” said Ashlee Albies, an attorney with the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “It is time for jails and prisons to recognize the harm that prolonged isolation can cause and adopt alternatives that promote safety and wellbeing.”

Myers’ case is also another example of the mistreatment of individuals with mental illness within the criminal justice system. In a study conducted by the Treatment Advocacy Center, it was found that individuals with untreated mental illnesses are 16 times more likely to be killed by police, and that prisoners with mental illness are more likely to be put in solitary confinement and to be subject to excessive and punitive disciplinary actions.

As the United States grapples with a mental health crisis, it is clear that more needs to be done to address the systemic issues within the criminal justice system. Reforms such as increased funding for mental health services and diversion programs, as well as changes to sentencing and parole guidelines, could go a long way toward preventing tragedies such as Myers’ death.

Ultimately, however, what is needed is a fundamental shift in the way society views and treats individuals with mental illness. Until we recognize the humanity of those who are struggling with mental health issues, we will continue to see tragedies like Myers’ death. It is time for change.",1

154,"Toxic smoke is spewing from an inferno at a recycling plant known as a 'fire hazard,' officials say. The flames could burn for days","Toxic smoke is spewing from an inferno at a recycling plant known as a 'fire hazard,' officials say. The flames could burn for days.

The recycling plant, located in the heart of a busy industrial area in the city, has been a cause for concern for local officials since its inception. The facility, which is operated by a private company, had a long history of fire incidents, raising concerns about its safety and impact on the surrounding community.

According to local reports, the fire started on Monday evening and quickly spread through the plant's storage area. The city's fire department rushed to the scene and tried to put out the flames, but they were met with intense heat, thick smoke, and exploding materials. Officials said the plant stored a range of flammable materials, including paper, plastics, oils, and chemicals, which fueled the flames.

As firefighters continued to battle the blaze, a thick plume of noxious smoke began to rise from the plant, spreading across the city and causing respiratory problems for residents living nearby. The city's mayor issued a warning to people to stay indoors and shut their windows as the smoke could cause irritation, breathing difficulties, and other health issues.

""The smoke is very toxic and can cause harm to people, especially those with respiratory problems or allergies,"" said the mayor in a news conference on Tuesday morning. ""Our priority now is to put out the flames as soon as possible before the smoke spreads further.""

The recycling plant, which was supposed to recycle waste materials and turn them into useful products, had been a source of controversy for local officials and environmental groups. The company that operated the plant had faced several fines and court cases over its safety record and alleged violations of environmental regulations.

Critics say the recycling plant operated in a poorly maintained facility with outdated equipment and unsanitary conditions, making it a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. They argue that the plant got away with its reckless practices due to weak enforcement by regulators and insufficient oversight by the government.

""This is a tragedy waiting to happen. We've been warning about the risks posed by this plant for years, but no one listened,"" said an environmental activist who lives near the plant. ""The authorities need to take accountability for allowing such hazardous facilities to operate in our communities.""

The recycling plant fire is not an isolated incident. According to a report by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), recycling plants are among the most dangerous workplaces for fires and explosions due to their storage of combustible materials like paper, wood, plastics, and metals. These facilities also often use heavy machinery and equipment that can ignite fires if not maintained properly.

The report states that between 2011 and 2015, there were around 300 fires at recycling facilities in the United States each year, resulting in millions of dollars in damages and injuries to workers and nearby residents. The NFPA recommends that recycling plants adopt better safety practices, including regular maintenance of machinery, proper storage of materials, and better training for employees.

The recycling plant fire has also raised concerns about the impact of waste disposal on the environment and public health. Environmental groups say that recycling plants are only one part of a broken waste management system that relies on incineration, landfills, and other harmful practices to dispose of waste.

They argue that the solution to the waste crisis is not to build more recycling plants but to reduce waste at its source, promote reuse and local composting, and implement sustainable waste policies that prioritize human and ecological health over profit.

""The recycling industry is not the panacea for our waste problems. It's a band-aid solution that covers up the real issue, which is overconsumption and the lack of political will to prioritize public health and the environment,"" said an environmental advocate.

The recycling plant fire serves as a stark reminder of the risks posed by hazardous waste facilities to public health and the environment. The incident also highlights the urgent need for better regulations, enforcement, and oversight of these facilities, as well as a shift towards more sustainable and responsible waste management practices.

For now, firefighters are still battling the flames at the recycling plant, and the city's residents are advised to stay vigilant and take precautions to avoid exposure to the toxic smoke. The recycling plant fire is a wake-up call that we cannot afford to ignore. We must act now to prevent such preventable disasters from happening again.",1

158,"Gunman livestreamed mass shooting at Louisville bank that left 5 dead and 8 injured, police say","A gunman in Louisville, Kentucky, livestreamed a mass shooting at a local bank that left five people dead and eight others injured, according to police.

The shooter, identified as 23-year-old Alex Gregory, reportedly entered the Fifth Third Bank in downtown Louisville on Wednesday morning armed with a 9mm handgun and opened fire on those inside the building.

Police responded to reports of an active shooter at the bank around 9:05 a.m. local time and engaged in a shootout with Gregory, who was eventually killed at the scene.

During the shooting, Gregory reportedly live-streamed the attack on social media, sharing images of his gun and showing himself firing at victims inside the bank.

In a press conference on Wednesday, LMPD Chief Steve Conrad confirmed that five people were killed in the shooting, including the gunman.

“We just heard multiple gunshots, about 10 at a time,” witness Whitney Austin told reporters. Austin, who works nearby, said she saw people running and screaming from the bank.

“It was very surreal,” she said.

The five victims were identified as: 58-year-old Vicki Lee Jones, 67-year-old Maurice Stallard, 28-year-old Angela M. Wright, and two Fifth Third Bank employees, 36-year-old Pruthvi Raj Kandepi and 49-year-old Luis Felipe Calderon.

Kandepi was remembered fondly by his colleagues on social media. “Pruthvi Raj Kandepi was an AMAZING person who touched the lives of so many friends and co-workers, always with a smile,” wrote one former colleague in a Facebook post.

Calderon, who worked at the bank for almost a decade, was described by friends and loved ones as a dedicated father and husband.

“He was an amazing man, big-hearted and kind,” Raquel Bono, a family friend, told the local news station, WAVE 3 News. “He was loved by everybody who entered his life.”

Injured victims were taken to nearby hospitals, where they were treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries.

Conrad commended the bravery of the responding officers and praised their quick thinking and response time.

“These men and women who wear the badge have families they go home to, and today they went home safe to their families because of their incredible sacrifice and heroism,” he said.

Many community members have also responded to the tragedy with an outpouring of support and sympathy for the victims and their loved ones.

Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin, who visited the scene of the shooting on Wednesday, offered his condolences to those affected by the violence.

“It’s a horrific thing that happened here,” he said. “As Kentuckians, we lift up those who are hurting and offer compassion and comfort.”

He urged all citizens to “love each other, respect each other, and genuinely care and pray for one another.”

The shooting in Louisville comes amidst a growing national debate over gun control and mental health policies in the United States.

Recent mass shootings, including the Parkland, Florida shooting in February 2018, have sparked protests and calls for tighter gun regulations, but little action has been taken on the federal level.

Advocates for gun control are calling on legislators to take action to prevent future violence like that seen in Louisville and elsewhere.

“We have a responsibility to do something about this,” said Tamika Mallory, an activist and co-founder of the Women’s March. “We can’t continue to have these kinds of things happening on our streets and in our schools and in our communities.”

Others have argued that the focus should be on mental health rather than gun control, emphasizing the need for better access to mental health services and preventative measures.

Despite the ongoing debate, it is clear that the impact of mass shootings on communities and individuals is devastating, and that actions must be taken to prevent future tragedies.

For the victims and families affected by the shooting in Louisville, the healing process will be long and difficult, but community members are pulling together to provide support and comfort in any way they can.

“We have to come together as a community to support each other and lift each other up,” said Mayor Greg Fischer in a statement. “Together, we will heal and move forward.”",1
159,One iguana's taste for cake leaves a young girl with a mysterious malady,"In a bizarre incident, a young girl from Florida was hospitalized with a mysterious illness after she shared her birthday cake with her pet iguana.

According to the girl's parents, their daughter had been eagerly awaiting her eighth birthday and had requested a special cake for the occasion. They obliged, ordering a chocolate and vanilla layered cake with bright pink icing.

However, on the day of the party, things took a turn for the unexpected when the family's pet iguana, named Iggy, crawled onto the table and began devouring the cake.

Despite their initial shock, the family found the sight of the iguana indulging in the cake amusing, and allowed it to continue its feast. Little did they know, this decision would have dire consequences for their daughter.

Within hours of consuming the cake, the young girl began to experience severe stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. Her parents rushed her to the hospital, where doctors were baffled by her symptoms.

Days went by without any improvement, and the doctors were forced to explore every possible cause for her condition. It wasn't until the family mentioned the iguana's cake feast that a new theory emerged.

It turns out that iguanas, like many other reptiles, are carriers of salmonella, a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning in humans. While salmonella typically affects humans through contaminated food, it can also be transmitted through contact with animals like iguanas.

In this case, it's believed that the iguana's saliva and backwash contaminated the cake, and that the young girl unknowingly ingested the bacteria while sharing the cake with her pet.

While salmonella is often a mild illness that clears up on its own, in some cases it can be much more severe, especially in young children and the elderly. Symptoms can range from mild gastrointestinal distress to more serious complications, such as sepsis and meningitis.

Thankfully, in this case, the girl eventually recovered after several weeks of intensive treatment with antibiotics and other medications.

However, the incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of keeping exotic pets and sharing food with them. While many people enjoy keeping pets like iguanas, snakes, and other reptiles, it's important to remember that these animals can harbor harmful bacteria and diseases.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reptiles and amphibians are responsible for a significant number of salmonella infections each year. The CDC recommends that households with young children, elderly adults, or people with weakened immune systems avoid keeping these pets altogether.

For those who do still wish to keep exotic pets, the CDC offers a range of tips for safe handling and sanitation practices to minimize the risk of infection. These include:

-Washing hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling reptiles or their enclosures
-Keeping reptile enclosures out of areas where food is prepared or consumed
-Using separate equipment and utensils for handling both reptiles and human food
-Cleaning reptile enclosures regularly and using disinfectant to kill any bacteria
-Not allowing reptiles to roam freely around the house or in areas where food is prepared or consumed
-And, of course, not sharing food with these animals

As for the young girl who fell ill after sharing her birthday cake with her pet iguana, her parents have learned a valuable lesson about the potential risks of exotic pet ownership. While they were fortunate that their daughter eventually recovered, they now understand the importance of proper hygiene and sanitation when it comes to caring for animals.

As for Iggy the iguana, he's reportedly doing just fine and has shown no signs of illness. However, his cake-eating days may be over for good.",1
160,Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn break up after six years,"After six years of dating, Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have reportedly called it quits. The couple, who were first linked in 2017, had kept their relationship relatively private and never confirmed their status publicly.

According to sources close to the couple, Swift and Alwyn’s busy schedules played a role in their split. The Grammy-winning singer is currently promoting her re-recorded album, ""Fearless (Taylor's Version),"" while Alwyn has been busy with his acting career.

“Taylor and Joe have been drifting apart for months now,” a source told E! News. “They realized they’re just in different places in their lives and decided it was best to go their separate ways.”

The source also added that the couple had a “mutual” and “amicable” breakup, and that there are “no hard feelings” between them.

Swift, 31, and Alwyn, 30, were last seen in public together in February, when they went on a hike in Los Angeles. Since then, they have not been spotted together, leading some fans to speculate that they had already broken up.

The news of their split comes just weeks after Swift released ""Fearless (Taylor's Version),"" which features re-recorded versions of songs from her 2008 hit album ""Fearless."" In the album’s liner notes, Swift thanked Alwyn for “the reason why I have this lyric.”

The song in question is “Gorgeous,” which features the lyrics, “And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us / He's in the club doing, I don't know what.”

Swift and Alwyn’s relationship was first reported in May 2017, just a few months after the singer ended her high-profile romance with Tom Hiddleston. The couple was spotted together several times in 2018, but mostly kept their relationship out of the public eye.

Swift has famously been private about her relationships, and even avoided mentioning Alwyn by name in interviews. In a 2019 interview with The Guardian, she referred to him as “someone who’s like a boyfriend” and said that she liked “having a more normal life” with him.

Fans of Swift and Alwyn are sure to be disappointed by the news of their breakup, but the couple’s commitment to privacy means that we may never know the true reason behind their split.",1
161,Russia's war in Ukraine,"Russia's War in Ukraine: The Conflict That Won't Go Away

The conflict in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 marked a turning point in Europe's relations with Moscow. The international community, led by the United States and Europe, implemented sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine. However, the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine and Russia's continued support for separatist rebels is a reminder that the conflict is far from over.

Despite the ceasefire agreement signed in Minsk in 2015, the war in eastern Ukraine continues to flare up. Since the conflict began in 2014, it has claimed over 13,000 lives and displaced over 1.5 million people. The Ukrainian government, backed by the West, has accused Russia of supplying separatists with weapons, funding, and troops. Russia, for its part, has denied any involvement in the conflict but has acknowledged that Russian volunteers are fighting in eastern Ukraine.

The conflict in Ukraine is the result of a complex mix of historical, political, and economic factors. The roots of the current crisis can be traced back to Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country, which became a democracy, was torn between its ties to the West and its historical and cultural links to Russia. Ukraine's political class was also deeply divided over the country's future direction. In 2013, popular protests erupted in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, over the decision of then-President Viktor Yanukovych to steer the country away from European integration and toward closer ties with Russia. Yanukovych was ousted in a popular uprising known as the Euromaidan Revolution.

Russia, which had previously supported Yanukovych, saw the Euromaidan Revolution as a threat to its strategic interests in Ukraine. Moscow quickly annexed Crimea, which had been part of Ukraine since 1954, and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine. The conflict quickly escalated into a full-blown war, with the Ukrainian military pitted against separatists who were backed by Russian troops. The conflict has since developed into a low-level insurgency, with frequent skirmishes along the front lines.

The war in Ukraine has been a major strain on relations between Russia and the West. The United States and Europe responded to Russia's actions in Ukraine by implementing economic sanctions against Moscow. The sanctions, coupled with the fall in oil prices, had a devastating effect on Russia's economy. The country's GDP fell by 3.7% in 2015, and by 2.3% in 2016. The sanctions have been extended several times since then, with the latest round set to expire in July 2021.

The sanctions have also had a political impact. Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine have made it a pariah state in the eyes of the West. Russia's relationship with the European Union in particular has deteriorated. The EU has suspended talks on a new partnership agreement with Russia, and has imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials and companies.

In response to the sanctions, Russia has turned to China for economic and political support. The two countries have signed several trade agreements, with China becoming Russia's largest trading partner in 2016. China has also been supportive of Russia's actions in Ukraine, and has blocked efforts by the United States and Europe to impose additional sanctions on Moscow at the United Nations Security Council.

The conflict in Ukraine has also had a humanitarian impact. The war has displaced over 1.5 million people, and has left many without access to basic services such as healthcare and education. The separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine have also been hit hard by the conflict. Many businesses have closed, and the region has been cut off from the rest of Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has accused separatists of committing human rights abuses, including the use of torture and arbitrary detention.

Efforts by international organizations to broker a lasting peace in Ukraine have been unsuccessful. The Minsk agreement, signed in 2015, called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the implementation of political reforms in eastern Ukraine. However, the agreement has been violated multiple times, with both sides accusing the other of failing to abide by its terms. The OSCE has a monitoring mission in Ukraine, but its efforts to monitor the ceasefire have been hampered by security concerns and obstruction from both sides.

The war in eastern Ukraine has become a frozen conflict, with occasional flare-ups and skirmishes along the front lines. The conflict has become a test of wills between Russia and the West, with Moscow using the war to show its strength and influence in the region. However, the conflict has not been without cost for Russia. Sanctions have hurt the economy, while the war has drained resources and resulted in the loss of Russian soldiers' lives.

The conflict in Ukraine shows no signs of coming to an end anytime soon. Despite the ceasefire agreement, fighting continues in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict, but with support from Russia and China, Moscow is in no hurry to end the fighting. The war in Ukraine is a reminder that the legacy of the Soviet Union still casts a long shadow over Europe, and that Russia's relations with the West remain fraught with tensions.",1
162,Clinics and doctors brace for more restrictions on women's health care after court ruling on abortion drug,"Clinics and doctors across the United States are preparing for the possibility of increased restrictions on women's health care following a recent court ruling on abortion medication.

Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency request from abortion providers to suspend a Texas law that bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The law, known as Senate Bill 8 (SB8), also allows private citizens to sue anyone who assists someone in obtaining an abortion after the six-week mark, including doctors and clinic staff. This aspect of the law has made it difficult for providers to challenge the law in court.

In response to the ruling, clinics and doctors who offer abortion services are bracing for even more restrictions on women's health care in the coming months and years.

""As a provider, it's hard not to be worried about what's coming next,"" said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, a reproductive health specialist in Virginia. ""We've been seeing a steady increase in restrictions on abortion care for the past few years, and now with SB8, it feels like we're heading into uncharted territory.""

One area of concern for providers is the availability of medication abortion, which involves taking pills to end a pregnancy in its early stages. The FDA currently requires providers to dispense the medication in person, meaning that many women have had to travel long distances to obtain the medication. However, due to the pandemic, the FDA temporarily relaxed this requirement, allowing providers to mail the medication to patients.

But this could change soon. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could determine the fate of the FDA's temporary policy. If the court rules against the policy, providers would once again be required to dispense medication abortion in person, making it more difficult for women in rural areas to access the care they need.

""There's a real fear that we could see a rollback of the progress we've made in terms of expanding access to medication abortion,"" said Dr. Kumar. ""If we're forced to revert to in-person dispensing, that's going to create a lot of barriers for women, especially those in rural areas who don't have easy access to a nearby clinic.""

Another area of concern for providers is the possibility of more laws like SB8 being passed in other states. Although there are no imminent threats, there are several states where abortion rights are already severely restricted, including Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.

""SB8 is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dr. Jennifer Conti, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford University School of Medicine and a spokesperson for Physicians for Reproductive Health. ""There are dozens of laws on the books in states across the country that make it harder for women to access abortion care. And if Texas can pass a law like SB8, there's nothing stopping other states from doing the same.""

In addition to the legal challenges, providers are also dealing with an increase in harassment and threats from anti-abortion activists. Clinics across the country have reported an uptick in protesters outside their doors, including some who have used violent and threatening language.

""We've always had to deal with protesters outside our clinic, but lately it's been worse,"" said Dr. Kumar. ""We're seeing more of them, and they're getting more aggressive. It's scary for our staff and for our patients.""

Despite these challenges, providers say they remain committed to offering the best possible care for their patients, regardless of the legal or social climate.

""We're not going to stop fighting for women's rights and for access to abortion care,"" said Dr. Conti. ""We know how important this care is for our patients, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure they can still get it.""

As clinics and doctors ready themselves for looming restrictions on women's health care, it remains to be seen how this will impact women across the country who rely on these services. But one thing is clear: the fight for reproductive rights is far from over, and providers stand ready to continue it in the face of whatever comes next.",1
163,"Concerned about the courts, some states and universities are stockpiling abortion drugs","As the battle over abortion rights heats up in America, some states and universities are taking precautions by stockpiling abortion pills. The move is part of a larger effort to protect access to abortion, which is facing a number of legal challenges.

According to a report from the Associated Press, at least six states have passed laws allowing pharmacists to prescribe abortion drugs like mifepristone and misoprostol, which can be used to terminate a pregnancy in its early stages. In some cases, universities and health clinics are also stocking up on the medication.

The trend is driven in part by concerns over the future of abortion rights in America. With the recent appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, many worry that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision could be overturned or significantly weakened. In such a scenario, access to safe and legal abortions could become even more limited.

In response, states like Maine, California, and Hawaii have passed laws allowing pharmacists to prescribe and dispense abortion drugs, making it easier for women in remote or underserved areas to access the medication. Other states, like Illinois and Rhode Island, have passed similar legislation but are waiting for the governor to sign it into law.

The effort has been praised by some as a creative way to protect abortion rights in the face of restrictive laws and hostile politics. Elizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization, told the AP that ""it's a smart strategy...It's one that really speaks to the needs of the community and the reality of the political environment that we're facing.""

However, the stockpiling of abortion pills is not without controversy. Opponents argue that it is not safe for women to take the medication without the guidance of a healthcare provider, and that it could lead to dangerous complications.

""The idea of women self-inducing abortions is a really scary thing,"" Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations and public policy at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told the AP. ""There's a reason why it's only available through a provider.""

Furthermore, some argue that the availability of abortion pills could exacerbate existing inequalities in access to healthcare. Women in rural areas or low-income communities may not have the resources or transportation to travel to a pharmacy or health clinic to obtain the medication. And without proper medical guidance, they may not know how to use the medication safely.

Despite these concerns, supporters of the trend say that the benefits outweigh the risks. In addition to providing access to abortion medication for women in need, it also sends a strong message to lawmakers and conservative groups that the fight for reproductive rights is far from over.

""The fact that we were able to get this done in Maine sends a signal that we are not going to let extremists stop us from ensuring that women have access to the reproductive healthcare that they need,"" Maine state senator Eloise Vitelli told the AP.

However, some experts say that stockpiling abortion pills is not a long-term solution to the issue of abortion access. While the medication can be used to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages, it is not effective for later-term abortions. And in some cases, it may not be safe for women to use the medication at all due to medical conditions or other factors.

What is needed, they say, is broader access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including contraception and safe, legal abortions.

""The idea of stockpiling [abortion pills] is a stopgap measure,"" Nash told the AP. ""It's not a permanent solution...We need to be looking at how we can expand access to abortion services so that women don't have to turn to this as a last resort.""

Indeed, the fight for reproductive rights in America is far from over. While activists and lawmakers are making progress in some areas, there are still many states and individuals who are actively working to restrict access to safe and legal abortion. And as the political climate continues to shift, it is likely that the battle will only intensify.

For now, the stockpiling of abortion pills may offer some measure of protection for women seeking to terminate a pregnancy. But it is not a guarantee, and it is not a substitute for comprehensive reproductive healthcare and access to safe, legal abortions. Only by continuing to advocate for these rights can we ensure that women have the freedom to make their own choices about their bodies and their futures.",1

165,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,"It's that time of the year again: tax season. For many people, filing taxes can be a daunting task that they procrastinate until the last minute. However, with the deadline fast approaching, it's important to understand what you need to know in order to file your taxes correctly and avoid penalties.

The deadline for filing your taxes this year is May 17th, 2021. This date was extended from the traditional April 15th deadline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it's important to note that if you owe taxes, they are still due by April 15th, even if you request an extension to file.

If you haven't filed your taxes yet, here's what you need to know:

Gather Your Documents:

Before you begin the process of filing your taxes, you need to make sure you have all of the necessary documents. This includes your W-2 form from your employer, any 1099 forms for freelance work or investments, and any receipts or documentation for deductions you plan to claim.

If you're missing any important paperwork, reach out to your employer or other sources as soon as possible. You may be able to access this information online or request a copy be mailed to you.

Understand Your Filing Status:

Your filing status determines how you will file your taxes and can impact your tax liability. The five standard filing statuses are:

- Single: This applies if you are unmarried, divorced, or legally separated and do not qualify for another filing status.
- Married Filing Jointly: If you are married, you can choose to file jointly with your spouse. This can provide certain tax advantages but can also hold both spouses responsible for any tax liability.
- Married Filing Separately: Couples who choose to file separately must each file their own tax return. This can be a more complicated process and may result in higher tax liability.
- Head of Household: This filing status applies to unmarried taxpayers who have a dependent living with them for more than half of the year. This status can provide several tax benefits but has specific requirements.
- Qualifying Widow(er) with Dependent Child: This status applies to taxpayers who are widowed, have not remarried, and have a dependent child. This status allows for certain tax benefits but is only applicable for a limited time after the spouse's death.

Choose Your Tax Preparation Method:

There are several options when it comes to preparing and filing your taxes. You can choose to do it yourself using tax preparation software or hire a professional tax preparer.

Tax preparation software can guide you through the process and help you identify any deductions or credits you may be eligible for. Some popular tax software options include TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxACT. These programs will also typically file your taxes for you electronically or provide you with printed forms to mail in.

If you choose to hire a professional tax preparer, make sure they are qualified and have experience filing taxes for individuals in situations similar to yours. You can find certified public accountants (CPAs) and enrolled agents (EAs) through professional organizations like the National Association of Enrolled Agents or the American Institute of CPAs.

Consider Deductions and Credits:

Tax deductions and credits can save you money on your tax bill by reducing your taxable income or providing a direct reduction to your tax liability. Some common deductions and credits include:

- Standard Deduction: This is a set amount that taxpayers can deduct from their income based on their filing status. For the 2020 tax year, the standard deduction is $12,400 for single filers and $24,800 for married filing jointly.
- Itemized Deductions: If you have significant expenses related to things like medical costs, charitable donations, or mortgage interest, you may be able to itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction. However, this option requires more paperwork and may not be beneficial for everyone.
- Earned Income Tax Credit: This credit is available for low- to moderate-income individuals and families who meet certain criteria. It can provide a significant reduction to your tax liability or even result in a refund.
- Child Tax Credit: This credit provides up to $2,000 per qualifying child under the age of 17. The credit is partially refundable, which means that even if you don't owe taxes, you may still be eligible to receive a refund based on the credit.
- Retirement Savings Contributions Credit: If you make contributions to a qualifying retirement account, you may be able to claim a tax credit for up to 50% of your contributions. This credit is designed to encourage individuals to save for retirement.

File Electronically:

Filing your taxes electronically can save you time and reduce the chance of errors. The IRS offers a free electronic filing option for taxpayers who meet certain income and eligibility requirements. You can also use tax preparation software to file electronically, which is often included in the cost of the software.

If you choose to file by mail, make sure you include all of the necessary forms and documentation and send it to the correct IRS address. Failure to submit all required documentation or send it to the correct address can result in delays or penalties.

Understand Potential Penalties:

If you fail to file your taxes or pay any taxes owed by the deadline, you may incur penalties and interest charges. The failure-to-file penalty is 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that the return is late, up to a maximum of 25% of the unpaid taxes. The failure-to-pay penalty is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that the tax remains unpaid, up to a maximum of 25% of the unpaid taxes.

Additionally, interest charges will accrue on any unpaid taxes until they are paid in full. If you cannot pay your tax bill in full by the deadline, you can request a payment plan or an offer in compromise to settle your debt for less than the full amount owed.

In conclusion, filing your taxes can seem like a daunting task, but understanding the process and requirements can make it much easier. Gather all of your necessary documents, choose the best tax preparation method for you, consider any deductions and credits you may be eligible for, file electronically if possible, and be aware of potential penalties for late filing or payment. By following these tips, you can file your taxes with confidence and avoid any unnecessary stress.",1
166,Police were called about a person with a rifle. It turned out to be a man in a Boba Fett costume,"In a bizarre incident, police in a small town in California received a report of a person carrying a rifle. Responding swiftly, the officers arrived at the location to find a man dressed in a Boba Fett costume, complete with a replica rifle.

The incident occurred on Wednesday afternoon, and according to the police department, the man was taking part in a cosplay event in the area. However, someone passing by saw him and mistook him for an armed person.

The police department, in a statement released to the press, said that they always prioritize the safety of the public, and they responded to the call accordingly. However, once the officers discovered that it was just a case of mistaken identity, they let the man go.

The incident has garnered a lot of attention on social media, with many people expressing their amusement at the situation. However, the police department has also cautioned against jumping to conclusions, emphasizing that it is always important to err on the side of caution when it comes to public safety.

This incident serves as a reminder that we must always be mindful of our surroundings and exercise caution when reporting any suspicious behavior. In this case, it was just a harmless cosplay enthusiast, but the situation could have easily escalated if not handled correctly.",1
167,China appears to simulate first aircraft carrier strike on Taiwan,"Tensions between China and Taiwan have been escalating over the past few years with both sides engaging in military posturing. However, the situation seems to have taken a dangerous turn with China reportedly simulating its first aircraft carrier strike on Taiwan, according to recent reports.

The move is being viewed as a significant escalation in the already tense relationship between the two countries. While Taiwan has maintained its position as a separate, democratic entity, China claims it as part of its own territory and has repeatedly threatened military action if Taiwan declares independence.

China has been building up its military capabilities over the past few years, which includes the deployment of its first domestically-built aircraft carrier, the Shandong, in late 2019. Although the ship is still undergoing testing and is yet to be declared fully operational, experts believe it is part of China's broader plan to expand its presence in the region.

In recent weeks, Chinese media outlets have reportedly published videos showing its aircraft carrier conducting simulated attacks on enemy ships, with Taiwan being the primary target. The videos show J-15 fighter jets taking off from the deck of the Shandong and conducting missile strikes on a mock-up of Taiwan's Presidential Office Building. Such simulations are typically conducted to test the readiness and capabilities of a country's military assets.

While the videos may have been intended primarily for domestic audiences in China, their release has been viewed as a signal to Taiwan and other countries in the region that China is flexing its military muscle. In response, Taiwan has called on China to exercise restraint and avoid any actions that could escalate tensions.

The United States, which has a longstanding alliance with Taiwan, has also expressed concern over China's military build-up and its actions in the region. The US has been increasing its military presence in the Pacific amid fears of China's expansionist policies, with the Trump administration pursuing a policy of ""maximum pressure"" on China to curb its aggressive behaviour.

While China has not explicitly stated its intentions to attack Taiwan, its recent military posturing and simulated attacks have raised concerns among analysts. Some believe that China may be attempting to intimidate Taiwan into submission or to send a warning to the US and other countries not to interfere in its regional ambitions.

However, there are others who argue that China may not be fully committed to the idea of an all-out military strike on Taiwan due to the potential risks involved. Taiwan is a small island nation with a mountainous terrain that would make it difficult to invade. Furthermore, any such move by China would surely be met with a strong response from the US and its allies in the region.

Nevertheless, the situation in the region remains fraught, with tensions continuing to rise even as the world struggles to contain the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. There are concerns that any misstep or miscalculation could lead to a wider conflict that could draw in other countries.

In recent months, the US and Taiwan have been increasing their cooperation, including signing a major arms deal worth billions of dollars. The deal includes selling advanced drones and missiles to Taiwan, which has raised anger from China. The US has also been conducting more frequent military drills in the region to maintain its readiness to respond if necessary.

China, for its part, has responded to the US moves with increased military activity, conducting its largest-ever military drills in the South China Sea in August. The drills involved submarine hunting exercises and simulated attacks on enemy ships, with Taiwan once again being the primary target.

The ongoing military posturing by both sides has raised concerns among experts, who warn that the situation could quickly spiral out of control. The prospect of a military conflict in the region, involving two of the world's largest militaries, is a sobering thought that should concern us all.

While a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue remains the best possible outcome, it is clear that China's recent military posturing and simulated attacks should be viewed as a serious escalation. The international community must continue to urge China to exercise restraint and to work towards a peaceful resolution of the dispute, which respects the sovereignty of Taiwan and avoids any unnecessary conflict.

As the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, the last thing we need is a major military conflict in one of the world's most populous and strategically important regions. It is time for cool heads to prevail, and for all parties to work towards a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to this long-standing issue.",1
168,U.S. doctor: We are already in an abortion crisis,"U.S. doctor: We are already in an abortion crisis

According to Dr. Willie Parker, an OB/GYN and reproductive justice advocate, the United States is already in an abortion crisis. In his new book, ""Life's Work: A Moral Argument for Choice,"" Parker argues that restrictions on abortion access and a lack of education about sexual health have marginalized low-income women and people of color. Parker also pushes back against the notion that anti-abortion sentiment is necessarily tied to religious or moral beliefs, saying that ""what's happening now is really about controlling women's bodies.""",1
169,First Atlantic hurricane season forecast issued on the same day as El Niño watch,"On Thursday, meteorologists at Colorado State University released their first seasonal hurricane forecast for the Atlantic basin. According to the report, 2021 is expected to bring an active hurricane season, with a total of 17 named storms, eight of which are predicted to become hurricanes. Furthermore, four of these hurricanes are forecasted to become major hurricanes with maximum sustained winds of 111 mph or higher.

The forecast comes as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the start of the annual El Niño watch. El Niño, a weather phenomenon characterized by warming of the waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, can have significant impacts on global weather patterns, potentially influencing hurricane formation in the Atlantic basin. Despite El Niño's potential effects, it is not a determinative factor for the hurricane season forecast.

The Colorado State University forecast takes into account a variety of factors, including El Niño, sea surface temperatures, and atmospheric pressure patterns. The report predicts an above-average hurricane season, with the expected number of named storms coming in well above the seasonal average of 12.1. 

The report concludes that there is a 69% chance that at least one major hurricane will make landfall along the continental United States coastline, compared to the long-term average of 52%. The risk of a major hurricane affecting the Gulf Coast, from the Florida Panhandle to Brownsville, Texas, is at 44%, higher than the long-term average of 30%.

Phil Klotzbach, the lead author of the report, stressed the importance of preparedness ahead of what could be a particularly active hurricane season. ""It is important to prepare the same for every hurricane season, regardless of how much activity is predicted,"" he said in the report. ""It only takes one land-falling hurricane to cause significant damage, and residents living along the coastline should prepare the same for every season, regardless of how much or how little activity is predicted.""

It's worth noting that this isn't the only forecast we'll see for the 2021 hurricane season. NOAA is set to release its own forecast in May, and other organizations and meteorologists are likely to weigh in in the coming weeks and months.

The release of the hurricane forecast on the same day as the El Niño watch is not necessarily unusual. That said, the timing serves as a reminder that we are entering the time of year when many weather patterns and phenomena can converge to make the Atlantic basin a particularly active and dangerous place for tropical storm formation.

El Niño may not necessarily cause more storms to form in the Atlantic Basin, but it can cause wind shear, which can potentially help to suppress storm formation. Alternatively, a La Niña weather pattern, characterized by cooler waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, can have the opposite effect, allowing for more storm formation. Regardless of what occurs in the Pacific, though, there are plenty of other factors that can pave the way for storm development in the Atlantic, as demonstrated by the forecast from Colorado State University.

The Atlantic hurricane season officially begins on June 1 and runs through November 30. In recent years, we've seen an increasing tendency for storms to form outside of that traditional window, with several notable storms forming in May over the past few years. The 2021 season will be the seventh in a row with an early formation, a trend that experts attribute to warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean.

Regardless of when storms form, though, the most important thing is to be prepared. The pandemic has added a layer of complexity to the hurricane response process, with the potential for shelter overcrowding and supply chain disruptions. Local emergency management officials are urging residents to have their disaster kits and evacuation plans finalized well ahead of the start of the season.

Meteorologists warn that it only takes one storm to cause widespread damage and destruction, as evidenced by the 2020 season, which saw a record 30 named storms and featured several devastating landfalls, including Hurricane Laura in Louisiana and Hurricane Eta in Central America. As we head into the 2021 season, it's crucial that residents along the coast remain vigilant and prepared for whatever the season may bring.",1

He also pointed out the lawsuits being filed against Fox News and predicted that the network will face more legal action in the future.",1
171,Zelensky slams 'beasts' who purportedly beheaded Ukrainian soldiers after video emerges,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has now slammed the ""beasts"" who are responsible for the purported beheading of Ukrainian soldiers, following the spread of a video that shocked the world last week.

The video, which was allegedly filmed in 2015, reportedly shows pro-Russian separatists decapitating Ukrainian soldiers, turning around and holding up their bloody heads for the camera.

Zelensky was quick to condemn the gruesome act, saying that the perpetrators must be held accountable for their crimes. ""I saw the video, and it was terrifying,"" he said. ""I cannot even describe how I felt when I watched it. These are not people, these are beasts.""

The video, which was uploaded to social media platforms last week, has stirred up memories of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia that began in 2014, after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula.

Both sides have accused each other of countless atrocities since the conflict began, but the video of the purported beheadings has been a particularly gruesome reminder that the conflict is far from over.

Zelensky has now vowed to do everything in his power to bring the perpetrators to justice, and has called on the international community to support him in this effort.

""We will not let this go unpunished,"" he said. ""We will do everything we can to find those responsible and to make sure they face justice. And we call on our partners and allies around the world to stand with us in this effort.""

The video has not only sparked outrage in Ukraine, but around the world as well. Many world leaders and human rights organizations have condemned the act, calling on the perpetrators to be brought to justice.

""This is a horrific violation of human rights, and those responsible must be held accountable,"" said Amnesty International's Europe Director, Marie Struthers. ""The international community must demand justice for the victims and their families, and pressure the authorities to bring those responsible to justice.""

Russia has denied any involvement in the purported beheadings, and has accused Ukraine of spreading propaganda and manipulating the video. However, many have pointed out that the video was reportedly filmed in the separatist-held territory of Donetsk, and that the perpetrators appear to be pro-Russian separatists.

The conflict in Ukraine has caused the deaths of over 13,000 people, and has displaced over 1.5 million more since 2014. Both sides have been accused of war crimes and human rights violations, with civilians often caught in the crossfire.

Zelensky has been working to resolve the conflict since he took office in 2019, but progress has been slow. The spread of the video has once again highlighted the urgency of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict and holding those responsible for war crimes accountable.

""We need to find a way to bring this conflict to an end,"" Zelensky said. ""The people of Ukraine are tired of war, and they deserve peace. We cannot let incidents like this derail our efforts to find a peaceful solution.""

The video of the purported beheadings has also raised questions about the use of social media platforms to spread violent and extremist content. Many have called on social media companies to do more to combat the spread of such content, and to ensure that their platforms are not being used to glorify violence and hatred.

Zelensky has urged social media companies to take action, saying that the spread of such content only creates more division and hatred.

""We need to work together to combat extremism and hate speech,"" he said. ""Social media companies must do more to ensure that their platforms are not being used to spread violence and hatred. We cannot allow this kind of content to go unchecked.""

The spread of the video of the purported beheadings has been a shocking reminder of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and of the brutality that both sides have been accused of. While it remains to be seen whether the perpetrators will be brought to justice, it is clear that the video has sparked renewed outrage and calls for action both inside and outside of Ukraine.",1
172,"Maryland sheriff and firearms dealer indicted in illegal machine gun acquisition scheme, DOJ says","The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday that a Maryland sheriff and a firearms dealer have been indicted for their involvement in an illegal machine gun acquisition scheme.

The accused are Frederick County Sheriff Charles A. Jenkins and firearms dealer Daniel L. Smalls. Jenkins has been charged with seven counts of false statements and for helping Smalls illegally obtain the machine guns. Smalls has been charged with conspiracy to commit the offense, illegal possession of machine guns, and illegal transfer of machine guns.

According to the indictment, Jenkins, who is also a licensed firearms dealer, allegedly accepted bribes and gifts from Smalls and assisted him in obtaining machine guns for personal use. Smalls, who is the owner of a firearms dealership, is accused of illegally transferring the machine guns to Jenkins on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2018.

The scheme came to light in 2018 when a federal law enforcement agency received information about the illegal acquisition and transfer of machine guns. An investigation ensued, and it was discovered that Jenkins and Smalls had devised a scheme to circumvent the legal process for acquiring machine guns.

The indictment alleges that Jenkins had provided false information to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) when applying for the firearms license. He had claimed that he intended to sell firearms for profit but had used his license to acquire machine guns for personal purposes.

The indictment also alleges that Smalls had falsified records by failing to report the machine gun transfers to Jenkins on his licensed firearm dealer's records. This made it difficult for authorities to trace the machine guns, and they were listed as missing.

Speaking at a press conference, Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner emphasized the severity of the charges against the two accused. “This type of conduct is not only illegal but threatens public safety by potentially putting firearms in the hands of those who should not have them,” he warned.

Jenkins, who has been serving as the Frederick County Sheriff since 2006, has been suspended from his position following the indictment. His lawyer, David Felsen, released a statement saying that Jenkins had cooperated with the DOJ and was eager to clear his name in court.

Smalls, on the other hand, will remain in custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.

Local officials expressed shock and disappointment over the allegations against Jenkins. Frederick County Executive Jan Gardner, in a statement, said that she was “deeply concerned about the allegations and saddened for the people of Frederick County.”

Jenkins is not the first law enforcement officer in Maryland to be indicted for firearms-related offenses. In 2019, two Prince George County police officers were charged in a gun trafficking operation.

The DOJ's crackdown on illegal firearms acquisition is part of the Biden administration's efforts to curb gun violence in the country. In April, President Joe Biden announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence, including measures to tighten regulations on ghost guns and to fund community violence intervention programs.

The indictment of Jenkins and Smalls sends a clear message that illegal acquisition and possession of firearms will not be tolerated. It is now up to the justice system to ensure that justice is served, and the accused are held accountable for their actions.",1

175,This life-saving medical device isn't required at all schools. Damar Hamlin wants to help change that,"As children head back to school, parents have a list of items to prepare, but what if life-saving medical devices were a required addition? For Damar Hamlin, a former college football player who collapsed and nearly died during a practice due to an undiagnosed heart condition, it’s not just a hypothetical concern.

“I was given a 20% chance of living,” Hamlin said. “I knew I was blessed, and I had a new purpose in life.”

His purpose has turned into Project Play It Safe, a nonprofit aimed at getting automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) into schools.

AEDs are portable electronic devices that can shock the heart back into its correct rhythm if it is suddenly stricken with cardiac arrest. They are simple to operate, but without one readily available, the chances of survival decrease significantly.

According to the American Heart Association, 2,000 people in the United States experience cardiac arrest outside of hospitals every day, and only about 10% survive. With defibrillation, they state that survival rates can increase up to 74%.

Hamlin’s drive for getting AEDs into schools started when a young football player from his hometown in North Carolina collapsed and died during practice from cardiac arrest. He knew the tragedy could have been prevented if an AED had been available.

In 2015, Project Play It Safe began, and Hamlin and his team started to raise funds to get AEDs into schools. The focus on schools came from the realization that they are often used as community centers.

“Schools are a hub for youth-related activities,” Hamlin said. “Not just from the educational standpoint, but after-school programs, sports, PTO, community meetings, and voting polls. We realized that schools are the epicenter.”

According to Hamlin, 8-12% of the population has a heart condition, and the majority of the time, it goes undiagnosed. He believes AEDs should be as prevalent as fire extinguishers.

“Fire extinguishers are in pretty much all public areas, why not defibrillators?” Hamlin said. “If we can save just one life, it is worth what we’re trying to do.”

However, unlike fire extinguishers, AEDs are not required in all schools. According to the American Heart Association, some states do require them, but there is no federal law.

According to a study by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, when high schools have AEDs, the survival rate for sudden cardiac arrests almost doubled.

Project Play It Safe has placed over 50 AEDs in schools, and Hamlin said the goal is to have AEDs in every school in the country. It’s an ambitious goal, but with community support and innovative fundraising, Hamlin believes it’s possible.

“Fundraising events – carwashes, silent auctions – that starts small, and it grows like a snowball effect,” Hamlin said. “We’ve worked hard to build relationships so that we can call on sponsors when we have an event, and we don’t have to constantly go back to the community to ask for donations.”

There is also an online store where shoppers can purchase items with a portion of the proceeds going toward buying AEDs.

“We have to be creative,” Hamlin said.

Damar’s mother, Crystal Hamlin, has been involved in Project Play It Safe from the beginning and said that watching her son take on this mission has been incredible.

“Watching him dedicating himself to something greater than just football after his injury was extremely heartwarming,” Crystal Hamlin said. “He took a tragedy and turned it into a triumph.”

While the ultimate goal is to keep every school equipped with an AED, Damar said there is nothing too small in helping make it happen.

“People can help by spreading the word on social media and sharing our story,” Damar Hamlin said. “It can go a long way. No gesture is too small.”

As far as getting legislation changed, Hamlin said it starts with local county commissions, school boards, and contacting representatives to get the ball rolling on changing the laws to require AEDs in schools.

“Everyone can get behind this,” Hamlin said. “It’s not political. Lives are at stake.”

It’s a sentiment of hope that Crystal Hamlin echoes.

“I see Project Play It Safe being nationwide, impacting the lives of hundreds of thousands of people,” she said. “If we can just save one life, then it’s all worth it.”",1
176,The fire at an Indiana plastics recycling plant is close to being extinguished as residents wonder what's now in the air,"Residents in Indianapolis, Indiana have been living with a nagging fear for the past four days as a massive fire continues to burn at the PolyAmerica plastics recycling plant. Thick black smoke has been seen billowing from the plant, blanketing parts of the city in toxic fumes. While the fire is now close to being extinguished, residents are asking what the impact on their health and environment will be in the aftermath.

Local fire departments have been working tirelessly to contain the fire that started on Saturday, June 16th around 1:30 A.M. Firefighters arrived to find the eastern half of the plant engulfed in flames, and it quickly became clear that this was no ordinary fire. The plant produces plastic films and bags, and the material stored on-site made it difficult for firefighters to extinguish the blaze. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

The PolyAmerica plant is located in a residential area, meaning that locals have not been able to escape the thick smoke emanating from the site. The plant has been closed for the past three days at the request of the city, and all production activities have been suspended. This has come as a relief to many residents who have been worried about the potential impact of the fire on their health.

One of those concerned residents is Barbara Johnson, who lives just a few blocks from the plant. ""The smell is overpowering, it's difficult to breathe,"" she said. ""I have asthma, and this has made it much worse. I can't imagine what it's like for those without pre-existing conditions."" Johnson is one of many who have started wearing face masks to protect themselves from the fumes.

The PolyAmerica plant is not the only industrial facility in the area. There are several other plants located nearby, and many residents are worried about the cumulative impact of pollution from all of these facilities. Air quality concerns have been raised repeatedly in recent years, with many locals describing the air as ""thick"" and ""smelly"" on a regular basis.

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) is monitoring air quality in the surrounding area, and so far has said that levels of pollutants are at safe levels. But residents remain skeptical. Many are pointing out that the testing being carried out by IDEM is only measuring for a limited range of pollutants, and that the impact of the fire on the environment could be more far-reaching. There are fears that the plastic materials still burning could release toxic fumes into the air, further exacerbating air quality problems.

The concerns raised by local residents highlight a wider problem with how environmental risks are managed in Indiana. The state has long been known for its pro-business policies, which have attracted a wide range of industrial facilities to the area. But the downside of attracting so much industry is an increased risk of pollution, and many residents feel that this risk is not being taken seriously enough.

Indiana has been ranked as one of the worst states in the country for air and water pollution, and the state legislature has come under criticism for failing to pass tougher environmental regulations. The PolyAmerica fire is just the latest example of a wider problem, and the lack of regulatory oversight has left many residents feeling vulnerable.

As the fire at the PolyAmerica plant nears its end, the immediate concerns for residents are what the long-term impact will be. The plant has been a fixture in the neighborhood for over 25 years, and locals worry that the impact of the fire will extend far beyond the current emergency.

The state authorities have promised to carry out a thorough investigation into the fire, and IDEM is continuing to monitor air and water quality in the surrounding area. But for residents like Barbara Johnson, this feels like too little, too late. ""We need tougher regulations on the industries in our area,"" she said. ""We can't keep putting our health and environment at risk.""

The PolyAmerica fire has highlighted a wider issue with how environmental risks are managed in Indiana. This should be a wake-up call to state authorities that tougher regulations are needed to protect the health and well-being of residents in the area. The PolyAmerica fire may now be close to being extinguished, but it has left a lasting impact on the local community that needs to be addressed.",1
177,CDC to warn some travelers to watch for Marburg virus symptoms as it investigates outbreaks in Africa,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to certain travelers to watch for symptoms of the deadly Marburg virus as they investigate outbreaks in Africa.

Marburg virus is a highly infectious disease that is similar to Ebola, and has a mortality rate of up to 88%. It is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals, and can cause fever, headache, vomiting and bleeding.

According to the CDC, tourists who have visited three African countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - since July this year should watch out for symptoms of the Marburg virus for up to 21 days after their return. The warning comes after recent outbreaks of the virus in these countries.

The CDC has also urged healthcare professionals to be vigilant for signs of the virus in patients who have traveled to these countries. They should be aware of the symptoms, as well as the risks associated with exposure to the virus, and should take appropriate precautions in order to prevent the spread of the disease.

The CDC's warning comes at a time when medical professionals are already overwhelmed with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Precautionary measures such as temperature checks and screenings for recent travel history are already in place in many places around the world.

However, the Marburg virus outbreak is an added concern for public health officials, as it can spread quickly and easily in areas with poor health infrastructure. It is also difficult to identify, with symptoms that are similar to other infectious diseases such as malaria and typhoid fever.

The outbreak comes as Africa is still grappling with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed the weaknesses of the public health systems in many countries on the continent. With limited resources and infrastructure, countries in Africa are struggling to contain the virus, and the situation is likely to get worse with the added burden of the Marburg virus.

The CDC has warned that the Marburg virus outbreaks in Africa are of great concern, and they are closely monitoring the situation. The organization is also working with local authorities, healthcare providers, and international partners to contain the outbreaks and prevent further spread of the virus.

The best way to protect yourself from the Marburg virus and other infectious diseases is to avoid coming into contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals. If you are traveling to areas where the virus is prevalent, it is important to take appropriate precautions such as wearing protective clothing and avoiding contact with animals that may carry the virus.

If you develop symptoms such as fever, headache, vomiting, or bleeding after returning from these areas, you should seek medical attention immediately. It is important to inform healthcare providers of your recent travel history, so that they can take the necessary precautions and make an accurate diagnosis.

The CDC's warning serves as a reminder of the importance of public health and the need for strong healthcare systems. It also highlights the need for international cooperation in the fight against infectious diseases, in order to prevent them from spreading across borders and causing widespread damage.",1
178,How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs,"Abortion is a controversial topic that has been debated for many years. The debate has been centered on different aspects of abortion, including the safety of the procedures used to terminate pregnancies. One such procedure is the use of the abortion pill, which has gained popularity as a non-invasive way to terminate early pregnancies. But how safe is the abortion pill when compared to other common drugs?

The abortion pill, also known as medication abortion, is a non-invasive way to terminate early pregnancies. It involves taking two different pills - mifepristone and misoprostol - within a 48-hour period. The first pill, mifepristone, blocks the hormone progesterone, which is essential for maintaining a pregnancy. The second pill, misoprostol, causes the uterus to contract and expel the contents of the uterus.

The use of the abortion pill has gained popularity over the years, with reports indicating that it accounts for a significant percentage of all abortions performed in the United States. According to data from the Guttmacher Institute, medication abortions accounted for 39% of all abortions performed in the United States in 2017, up from 29% in 2014.

However, the use of the abortion pill has also been shrouded in controversy, with some critics questioning its safety compared to other common drugs. Despite this, research has shown that the abortion pill is safe and effective, and its use is associated with lower rates of complications compared to surgical abortions.

A study published in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2015 analyzed data from over 13,000 medication abortions and found that the rate of major complications was less than 0.5% - a rate that is comparable to other commonly used medications. The study also found that medication abortions were associated with fewer minor complications, such as bleeding or infection, when compared to surgical abortions.

Additionally, the abortion pill is considered safer than many other drugs that are commonly prescribed. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that medication abortions were associated with fewer adverse events than the use of Viagra or cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Despite this, some critics have argued that the use of the abortion pill can lead to serious complications, such as heavy bleeding or infection. While it is true that any medical procedure can have potential risks, the risk of complications from using the abortion pill is relatively low. Additionally, the side effects of the abortion pill are generally mild and include cramping, bleeding, and nausea.

Moreover, the use of the abortion pill is closely monitored by healthcare providers, who provide patients with information on what to expect and how to manage any potential complications. Patients are also advised to seek medical attention if they experience any severe symptoms or if they have concerns about their health.

One of the positive aspects of using the abortion pill is that it allows women to have control over their reproductive health. Women who choose to use the abortion pill can do so in the comfort and privacy of their own homes, without the need for surgical procedures or hospitalization. The use of the abortion pill also allows women to avoid some of the psychological trauma that can be associated with surgical abortions and promotes greater autonomy and self-determination.

In contrast, surgical abortions require women to undergo a medical procedure, which can be more invasive and involve greater risks. Depending on the type of surgical procedure used, surgical abortions may require general anesthesia and hospitalization. Some studies have also shown that surgical abortions are associated with higher rates of complications, such as infections and hemorrhaging, when compared to medication abortions.

In addition to its safety, the abortion pill is also an effective method of terminating pregnancies. According to a 2018 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, medication abortions are up to 98% effective when used during the first trimester of pregnancy.

However, access to the abortion pill is restricted in some states, particularly in states with conservative legislatures that have enacted laws intended to restrict access to abortion services. For example, some states have required doctors to offer women seeking medication abortions with outdated and inaccurate information regarding the safety and efficacy of the abortion pill. Other states have placed restrictions on the use of the abortion pill, such as requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before using the pill or requiring healthcare providers to be present when the pill is taken.

In conclusion, while the use of the abortion pill has been controversial, research has shown that it is a safe and effective method of terminating early pregnancies. Compared to other commonly used drugs, the abortion pill is associated with lower rates of complications and adverse events. Additionally, the use of the abortion pill allows women to have greater control over their reproductive health and promotes autonomy and self-determination. However, the restriction of access to the abortion pill in some states is a concerning trend that impacts women's reproductive rights and access to safe and effective healthcare.",1
179,FDA takes only drug for premature birth off the market,"The United States Food and Drug Administration has recently decided to withdraw the only drug that was approved for preventing premature birth. The move has sparked concern among healthcare providers and expectant mothers who rely on the medication to ensure the safe delivery of their babies.

Makena, the drug in question, has been available to pregnant women since 2011. It has been used to treat women whose previous pregnancy ended before 37 weeks due to premature birth. The drug contains a synthetic version of progesterone, a hormone which helps to maintain pregnancy by preventing contractions.

The FDA’s decision came after a study (the PROLONG trial) showed that the medication had no significant effect on reducing preterm birth rates. The study compared the effectiveness of Makena with a placebo in preventing premature births in women who had a history of preterm delivery.

The findings of the study prompted an advisory committee to the FDA in 2019 to recommend that the approval of the drug be withdrawn. However, this decision raised concerns among some healthcare providers who disputed the study’s methods and argued that Makena had been beneficial to many patients.

The FDA gave the manufacturer of Makena, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, an opportunity to conduct another trial in order to verify the drug’s effectiveness. However, the subsequent trial failed to confirm the initial findings of the PROLONG study, and as a result, the FDA decided to withdraw the drug from the market.

The FDA’s Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, has stated that this decision was not taken lightly. “We must also consider the historical context of this decision: Makena was originally approved under an accelerated approval pathway intended to provide earlier access to treatments for serious and life-threatening conditions based on a surrogate endpoint, in this case, a laboratory measure that had been generally accepted as indicating a protective effect against preterm birth,” he said in a statement.

The FDA’s decision has led to mixed reactions. While some healthcare providers have welcomed the move, others are concerned about the impact this will have on maternal and fetal health. “There are many other options for women who need to reduce their risk of preterm birth, but some of these options may not be as effective as Makena in certain populations,” says Dr. Sindhu K. Srinivas, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr. Srinivas adds that the loss of Makena will be particularly hard on women who are at high risk of preterm birth, such as those with a prior preterm birth, a shortened cervix, multiple gestations, or other risk factors.

The March of Dimes, a non-profit organization that focuses on improving maternal and infant health, has also expressed disappointment over the decision. The organization has been a strong advocate for the use of Makena in preventing preterm births and has called on the FDA to reconsider its decision.

“While we respect the FDA’s process, we are concerned that the withdrawal of Makena will worsen the already high preterm birth rate in the US,” said the organization in a statement. “The lack of an approved medication for women at high risk of preterm birth puts them and their babies at significant risk.”

According to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, preterm birth affects about one in ten pregnancies in the US, and it is a leading cause of infant mortality and long-term health problems.

Many expectant mothers who have been relying on Makena to prevent premature birth have also expressed their frustration and fear over the drug’s withdrawal. Emily S., a mother from California who had used Makena during her previous pregnancy, says that the drug gave her peace of mind.

“I had a preemie the first time around, so when I was pregnant again, I was anxious about the same thing happening. Makena helped me relax and feel like I was doing everything I could to keep the baby safe,” she explains.

Emily adds that she is now concerned about what options will be available to her if she decides to have another child in the future. “This decision feels like a step backward for women’s health. It’s scary to think there might not be a medication available to help prevent premature birth,” she says.

For now, the FDA has advised healthcare providers to stop prescribing Makena and to discuss other treatment options with their patients. The agency has also assured the public that it will continue to monitor the safety and effectiveness of other medications that are currently being used to treat preterm birth.

The decision to withdraw Makena from the market has undoubtedly caused anxiety among expectant mothers and healthcare providers. While the FDA’s decision was based on the lack of evidence that the drug was effective, it is clear that more needs to be done to ensure that women who are at high risk of preterm birth have effective and safe treatment options available to them.",1

181,"Mysterious hepatitis outbreak in kids in 2022 linked to common childhood respiratory virus, studies suggest","In 2022, a mysterious outbreak of hepatitis in children has left many parents and healthcare professionals concerned. The illness, which causes inflammation of the liver, has been linked to a common childhood respiratory virus, according to recent studies.

The outbreak has been intense in some parts of the country, with hundreds of cases reported in states like Texas, California, and New York. While the hepatitis symptoms in adults are well-known and easily recognizable, the cases in children have left many scratching their heads.

According to the latest research, the hepatitis outbreak is caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. RSV typically only causes a mild illness, but in rare cases, it can lead to more severe symptoms such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and even hospitalization.

The studies were conducted independently by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The studies found that children who tested positive for RSV were six times more likely to also have hepatitis compared to those who didn't test positive for the virus.

Dr. Stephen Feinstone, a viral hepatitis researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained in an interview with CNN that RSV and hepatitis C viruses behave similarly, making it easy for the virus to invade liver cells and cause inflammation.

""It's like a portal for the hepatitis virus to enter,"" he said. ""So when the normal liver cells are damaged, as can occur with RSV, it makes it a little easier for a hepatitis virus to come in and take over.""

However, there are some cases where hepatitis symptoms develop without the presence of RSV, which has left doctors and researchers puzzled. Despite the lack of clear understanding of the cause, experts are recommending that parents of young children take extra precautions to prevent the spread of both the RSV virus and the hepatitis outbreak.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, advises parents to take basic hygiene measures such as washing hands frequently and keeping surfaces clean. Additionally, parents should ensure that their children are vaccinated against RSV, especially those with an increased risk of severe illness, such as premature infants and those with heart, lung, or immune system problems.

""Most children get RSV by the time they're two, but if they're vaccinated, it can prevent the more severe symptoms,"" he said.

As for the hepatitis outbreak, doctors are urging parents to be vigilant about their children's health and to seek medical attention if any symptoms are noticed. Some signs of hepatitis in children include a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, dark urine, abdominal pain, nausea, and fatigue.

The hepatitis outbreak in children is a stark reminder that viruses and illnesses can often work in unexpected and mysterious ways. As researchers continue to uncover the cause of this outbreak, it is crucial that parents and caregivers remain vigilant and take proactive measures to keep their children healthy and safe.

In the end, the importance of vaccination and basic hygiene practices can never be overstated – it is essential to protect not only ourselves but the vulnerable populations around us as well. By practicing good hygiene and seeking medical attention at the first sign of illness, we can all do our part to prevent the spread of dangerous viruses like RSV and hepatitis.",1
182,"Elizabeth Holmes must report to prison this month while waiting out her appeal, judge rules","San Francisco, California - Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the failed biotech startup Theranos, will have to report to prison this month while she awaits her appeal, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.

Holmes, who specializes in blood testing, was found guilty in March on four out of 11 charges of fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Her company, Theranos, was once valued at $9 billion but collapsed in 2018 amid accusations of fraudulent activity.

The judge sentenced Holmes to 20 years in prison, with the possibility of parole after 10 years, in September. However, her attorneys filed an appeal last month, which would postpone her report date to prison.

Holmes' attorneys had requested that she be able to remain free on bail while she appeals the conviction. However, Judge Edward J. Davila denied the request and ordered Holmes to report to prison by August 4th.

Prosecutors argued that Holmes was a flight risk, given that she has access to a significant amount of financial resources and had shown a willingness to deceive investors in the past.

""The defendant poses a real risk of flight based on the sizable financial resources at her disposal, her former access to private jets, and her prior role in misleading investors about the nature and value of her company,"" prosecutors wrote in their response to Holmes' request.

Holmes' legal team had argued that she was not a flight risk and that she had strong family and community ties. They also argued that the COVID-19 pandemic posed an additional risk to Holmes' health and safety while incarcerated.

Despite the arguments made by her legal team, Judge Davila was not swayed and felt that the risk of flight outweighed the concerns over COVID-19.

""While the Court is sensitive to concerns about COVID-19 exposure in detention centers, the Court finds that concerns raised by defense counsel do not, on this record, outweigh the risk of flight,"" Judge Davila wrote in his order.

Holmes now faces the prospect of serving her 20-year sentence in a federal prison. Her attorneys have promised to continue fighting the conviction and to pursue an appeal. The appeal process could take several months, if not longer.

In the meantime, the Theranos scandal has continued to reverberate throughout the biotech community, raising questions about the accuracy and ethics of blood-testing technology. The case has also become a cautionary tale for startups looking to disrupt established industries, reminding them of the importance of transparency and accountability.

As for Holmes, she will soon face the consequences of her actions, being forced to pay for defrauding investors for years.",1

184,This Chicago doctor donated her kidney to a woman in Virginia she'd never met,"In a world where divisiveness and isolationism seem to be dominating the headlines, stories of altruism and compassion can provide a much needed dose of positivity. Such is the case with Dr. Colleen Coleman, a physician in Chicago who recently donated her kidney to a complete stranger in Virginia.

It's a decision that many would consider risky or crazy, but for Coleman, it was a matter of fulfilling her personal values and living out her faith. ""I've always been a giver,"" she said in an interview with CNN. ""I believe in doing for others and helping out where I can. So when I learned about the opportunity to donate a kidney to someone who needed it, I knew it was something I had to do.""

The journey of how Coleman's act of kindness came about is a tale of two strangers brought together by a web of circumstances and chance encounters. It began with a woman named Karol Franks, a resident of Virginia who had been suffering from end-stage kidney disease for years. She had been on the transplant waiting list for a while, but there were no compatible donors available.

That's when Franks' husband decided to take the matter into his own hands by posting a plea for help on social media. He wrote about his wife's condition and the urgent need for a kidney donor who could help save her life. The post quickly went viral and was shared across different platforms, eventually reaching the eyes of a group of medical students at the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago.

One of those students was Coleman, who felt compelled to take action. She reached out to Franks and offered to get tested to see if her kidney would be a match. The tests were conducted, and to everyone's amazement, Coleman turned out to be a perfect donor match for Franks.

But here's the thing: Coleman and Franks had never met before. In fact, they didn't even live in the same state. For Coleman, the decision to donate her kidney to a complete stranger was a leap of faith. ""I didn't know anything about her, her personality or her family,"" she said. ""But I know what it feels like to need help and not have anyone there for you. And so I wanted to be that person for someone else.""

Before the transplant surgery took place, Coleman flew to Virginia to meet Franks and her family in person. They hit it off immediately, bonding over their shared love of cooking and travel. ""It was like we had known each other for years,"" Coleman recalled. ""And when I saw Karol in person and saw the toll that her illness was taking on her, it made me even more determined to go through with the transplant.""

The successful transplant surgery took place at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville in late August, and both Coleman and Franks are now on the road to recovery. Franks expressed gratitude to Coleman, calling her a ""blessing from God."" She also revealed that her husband's social media post had resulted in many people reaching out to her with offers of help and support.

""I didn't expect it to go viral or to get so much attention,"" Franks said. ""It's overwhelming in a good way to know that people care and are willing to help a complete stranger.""

Coleman, for her part, hopes that her decision to donate her kidney will inspire others to consider doing the same. ""There are so many people out there who need help,"" she said. ""And I know that not everyone is in a position to donate an organ. But there are other ways to give back – volunteering, donating blood or plasma, supporting organ donation organizations. It's all about finding what works for you and doing what you can.""

The act of organ donation is indeed a selfless and courageous one. As of 2019, there were over 100,000 Americans waiting for an organ transplant, with an estimated 20 people dying each day while waiting for a suitable donor. While organ donation rates have been rising steadily over the years, there is still a lack of awareness and understanding around the process.

That's why Coleman has been using her newfound platform to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation and to dispel some of the myths and misconceptions that surround it. She has been featured in numerous news outlets and has even been invited to speak at conferences and events.

""I never thought that my decision to donate my kidney would lead to all of this,"" she said. ""But I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my story and hopefully inspire others to consider becoming organ donors.""

In a world where people are often quick to shut themselves off from one another, stories like Coleman's serve as a reminder that we are all interconnected and capable of helping each other out. It doesn't take a grand gesture to make a difference – sometimes, all it takes is a small act of kindness to change someone's life.

As for Coleman and Franks, their connection goes beyond the physical transplant surgery. They have become friends and have promised to keep in touch. ""She's part of my family now,"" Franks said of Coleman. ""I couldn't have asked for a better donor or a better friend.""

For Coleman, the experience has been life-changing in more ways than one. ""I've learned that giving is really the best way to receive,"" she said. ""It's the most fulfilling thing you can do."" With her story, she challenges us to take up the mantle of altruism, to give in whatever way we can, and to transform our world from one of hatred to one of love.",1
185,Johnson & Johnson halts development of RSV vaccine in midst of late-stage clinical trials,"Johnson & Johnson has announced that it has stopped the development of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in the midst of late-stage clinical trials. The company made this decision after reviewing the interim data from its current Phase 2b study. According to the company, the data showed that the vaccine did not meet the pre-specified criteria for efficacy.

RSV is a virus that causes respiratory infections, particularly in infants and young children. It can also be severe and life-threatening for older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions. Although there is currently no approved vaccine, the development of one has been an important goal for medical researchers.

Johnson & Johnson had been working on its RSV vaccine for years, investing heavily in research and development. The news that it is now stopping the program is a significant setback for the company and the wider medical community. There are currently no other vaccines in late-stage clinical trials, meaning that Johnson & Johnson's discontinuation of the program leaves a considerable gap in the RSV vaccine pipeline.

In a statement, Johnson & Johnson explained that it is committed to advancing new treatments for RSV and will continue to evaluate different approaches. However, it also admitted that it is disappointing to have to stop the development of the vaccine at this stage.

The company's decision also has financial implications. Johnson & Johnson has indicated that it will take a charge of approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter of the year, related to the discontinuation of the RSV program.

This news underscores the challenges and risks of medical research and development. Even with significant investment, it is not always possible to develop a successful vaccine or treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these challenges into sharper focus and highlighted the importance of collaboration and innovation in medical research.

Despite this setback, there are still many ongoing efforts to develop vaccines and treatments for RSV, and medical researchers will continue to work towards this goal. Johnson & Johnson's decision is a reminder that progress in medical research is not always straightforward, and that setbacks are inevitable on the way to breakthroughs.",1
186,Third teenage suspect arrested in Florida triple homicide,"Authorities have arrested a third teenage suspect in connection with the triple homicide that took place in Frostproof, Florida on July 17. The victim's bodies were found by a passerby who saw their broken-down car and went to offer assistance. The victims were identified as Brandon Rollins, 27, Keven Springfield, 30, and Damion Tillman, 23. 

The third suspect, 18-year-old Tony ""TJ"" Wiggins, was taken into custody after a manhunt that involved several law enforcement agencies. Wiggins had previously been arrested 22 times and had a history of violence according to Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.

The other two suspects in the case, 26-year-old William Robert ""Robert"" Wiggins and 21-year-old Mary Whittemore, were arrested last week. Robert Wiggins is the brother of TJ Wiggins.

According to Sheriff Judd, the three suspects were ""rambling around town"" in their car and came across the victims when they stopped to fish in a nearby lake. They allegedly had a confrontation with them and the situation escalated to the point where they were shot and beaten to death with a tire iron.

The motive for the killings is still unclear, but Sheriff Judd speculated that the suspects might have mistaken the victims as someone else they had a previous issue with.

The community has been devastated by the murders, with many expressing shock and horror that such a violent crime could occur in their small town. The Rollins family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover funeral expenses.

The arrests of the three suspects have brought some relief and closure to the families and friends of the victims, but they are still struggling to come to terms with their loss.

Sheriff Judd praised the cooperation and hard work of the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation and said that justice will be served for the victims and their families.

The three suspects are being held without bail and are facing charges of first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. They are scheduled to appear in court on August 31.",1
187,Affirmative Action Fast Facts,"Affirmative Action Fast Facts

Affirmative action has been a topic of debate in the United States for decades, with strong opinions on both sides of the issue. Supporters argue that affirmative action programs are necessary to address discrimination and ensure equal opportunities, while opponents argue that these policies are unfair and can result in reverse discrimination. In this article, we will explore the key facts and statistics related to affirmative action.

What is Affirmative Action?

Affirmative action refers to policies or programs aimed at increasing the representation of minorities, women, and other underrepresented groups in education, employment, and other areas. Affirmative action policies may involve providing special consideration or affirmative action plans to members of these groups.

Affirmative action can take many forms, including:

- Goals and timetables: Setting numerical goals and timetables to increase the representation of underrepresented groups.
- Recruitment efforts: Actively recruiting from underrepresented groups and using outreach and advertising to attract a diverse pool of applicants.
- Training and development: Providing training and development opportunities specifically for members of underrepresented groups.
- Special consideration: Providing special consideration or preferences to members of underrepresented groups in admissions, hiring, promotions, or awarding contracts.

Affirmative Action in College Admissions

One of the most controversial applications of affirmative action is in college and university admissions. Critics argue that affirmative action policies in admissions are discriminatory and result in less qualified applicants being admitted over more qualified ones. Proponents argue that these policies are necessary to ensure diversity on college campuses and address past discrimination.

According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, roughly 11% of undergraduate students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the United States in 2019 were Black, while 18% were Hispanic. By comparison, Black and Hispanic students make up 13% and 18% of the U.S. population, respectively.

Affirmative action policies can help address this disparity by providing special consideration or preferences to underrepresented groups in admissions. However, there are limitations on the use of affirmative action in admissions. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in Grutter v. Bollinger that affirmative action policies can be used to promote diversity in higher education, but must be narrowly tailored to achieve this goal.

Affirmative Action in Employment

Affirmative action policies can also be used in employment to promote diversity and address discrimination. In 2019, the labor force participation rate was highest for White workers (62.7%) and lowest for Black workers (62.3%), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Affirmative action policies in employment can involve setting goals and timetables for hiring and promoting members of underrepresented groups, as well as providing special consideration or preferences in the hiring process. However, the use of affirmative action policies in employment is also subject to limitations.

In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in University of California v. Bakke that quota-based affirmative action policies in employment are unconstitutional. While affirmative action can be used to promote diversity in the workplace, it cannot be used to create a quota or set aside a certain number of jobs or promotions for members of underrepresented groups.

Affirmative Action in Government Contracting

The federal government also uses affirmative action policies in its contracting practices to encourage diversity and promote opportunities for small businesses and underrepresented groups. The federal government spends billions of dollars each year on contracts with private businesses, and affirmative action policies can help ensure that these contracts are awarded to a diverse range of companies.

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) oversees affirmative action policies for federal contractors and subcontractors. These policies may involve setting numerical goals and timetables for awarding contracts to minority-owned, women-owned, and small businesses, among other underrepresented groups.

Criticism of Affirmative Action

Despite the stated goals of affirmative action policies to promote diversity and address discrimination, these policies also face significant criticism from opponents who argue that they are unfair and discriminatory in their own right.

Critics argue that affirmative action policies can result in less qualified candidates being admitted or hired over more qualified ones, and can create the perception that members of underrepresented groups require special treatment to succeed. Opponents also argue that affirmative action can result in reverse discrimination against members of majority groups who may be equally qualified for a job or admission.

In recent years, some states have banned affirmative action policies in college admissions and employment. States including California, Washington, and Michigan have all passed laws banning affirmative action in higher education, while others including Texas and Florida have implemented similar bans through court rulings.

However, recent events have brought the issue of affirmative action back into the public consciousness. Following the death of George Floyd and the resulting protests and reckoning with racial injustice in America, some colleges and universities have announced renewed commitments to diversity and have considered using affirmative action policies to achieve those goals.

The Future of Affirmative Action

As the United States continues to grapple with issues of discrimination and inequality, the use of affirmative action policies in areas such as college admissions, employment, and government contracting will likely continue to be a point of debate.

While the Supreme Court has laid out some guidelines for the use of affirmative action in higher education, the issue remains highly politically charged and may ultimately be decided on a state-by-state basis or through further Supreme Court rulings.

Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that the issue of affirmative action will continue to be a point of controversy and discussion for years to come.",1
188,Wall Street has found something else to worry about,"Wall Street has always been a place of constant worries and concerns. However, in recent weeks, the focus has shifted from the usual market fluctuations and geopolitical tensions to a new and unexpected player: the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

While the virus originated in China and has had a major impact on the global supply chain, its impact on financial markets has been felt around the world. Stock markets have seen unprecedented volatility, with some experiencing their largest one-day drops in years. Wall Street itself has not been immune, with major indices experiencing their worst week in years at the end of February.

The potential impact of the coronavirus on global growth has caused alarm among investors. Many are concerned that it will continue to spread and disrupt business activities around the world. Some economists have already begun to lower their growth forecasts for this year, with some estimating that the virus could shave off as much as half a percentage point from global growth.

But it’s not just the economic impact of the virus that has Wall Street worried. The response from governments to contain the outbreak has led to a sharp increase in political risk. The Chinese government's initial response to the outbreak has been heavily criticized, leading to increased tensions between China and its trading partners.

In addition, a number of countries around the world, including the United States, have implemented travel restrictions and quarantine measures in an attempt to contain the virus. These measures, while necessary, are causing major disruptions to business activities globally, and have the potential to create a vicious cycle of economic and political problems.

The recent slump in oil prices, which has been caused by the sharp drop in demand from China, has also been a source of concern for investors. Oil prices have seen some of their largest drops in years, with some analysts forecasting that they could get even lower in the short term.

All of these factors have led to a growing sense of unease among investors. Many are now questioning whether the current bull market, which has been going on for over a decade now, could finally be coming to an end. While this remains to be seen, it is clear that the coronavirus outbreak has added significant uncertainty to an already uncertain market.

What is clear, however, is that the virus is likely to have a significant and lasting impact on the global economy. Some sectors, such as travel and tourism, are already feeling the effects of the outbreak, and others are likely to follow. In addition, the political and economic impact of the virus is likely to be felt for months, if not years, to come.

Investors are already beginning to look for safe havens amid the market volatility. Gold prices, for example, have seen significant gains in recent weeks, with some investors seeing it as a hedge against the uncertainty caused by the virus. Bonds, too, are seeing increased demand, with yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note reaching record lows.

The impact of the virus on the tech industry is also worth noting. Many major tech companies, including Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing and has warned that it may not meet its quarterly revenue expectations, are already feeling the effects. It remains to be seen how much further the tech industry will be impacted, but the longer the virus continues to spread, the more likely it is to have a lasting impact on the sector.

The ongoing coronavirus outbreak has once again highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy. What started as a health crisis in China has quickly become a global issue with major economic and political implications. The situation is fluid and unpredictable, making it difficult for investors to assess the risks.

While Wall Street has weathered many storms in the past, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak presents a unique challenge. The virus has added significant uncertainty to an already uncertain market, and investors are likely to be cautious in the coming weeks and months.

As always, it is important for investors to remember that volatility is a natural part of the market. In times of uncertainty, however, it is even more important to focus on the long-term and take a disciplined approach to investing.

The coronavirus outbreak is a reminder that risks can come from unexpected sources. It is important for investors to remain vigilant and informed as the situation continues to unfold. While it may be tempting to panic or make drastic changes to your investment strategy, it is important to remember that a well-diversified portfolio, based on your individual goals and risk tolerance, is the best way to weather any storm.

In conclusion, Wall Street has found a new and unexpected thing to worry about, and the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is likely to have a lasting impact on the global economy. While the situation is unpredictable and uncertain, investors can take measures to protect themselves by staying informed, remaining disciplined, and focusing on the long-term.",1
189,A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise,"In the fight against Covid-19, scientists have been exploring a multitude of approaches to develop a safe and effective vaccine. One such approach that is currently gaining traction is the development of a nasal vaccine. This novel method has shown early promise in animal studies, and researchers are hopeful that it will also prove successful in humans.

The premise of a nasal vaccine is simple: instead of administering the vaccine through injection, the vaccine is delivered through the nose. The nasal cavity is lined with a thin layer of mucus that acts as a barrier to protect against pathogens, including viruses like Covid-19. When a vaccine is delivered through the nose, it can stimulate an immune response at the site of infection and generate immunity in the respiratory tract.

Researchers have been exploring nasal vaccines for over a decade for a range of respiratory illnesses, including influenza, tuberculosis, and respiratory syncytial virus. Now, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, teams around the world are investigating whether this approach can be applied to generate an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

One of the leading vaccine candidates in this category is being developed by researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The vaccine, called AdCOVID, uses a modified adenovirus – the same type of virus used in the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines – to deliver the genetic material for the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2.

In preclinical trials with mice, the AdCOVID nasal vaccine produced strong immune responses, generating both neutralizing antibodies and T-cells, which are essential components of the immune system that can recognize and attack infected cells. Studies have also found that the vaccine can trigger an immune response in the lungs, which is a key goal for any Covid-19 vaccine as the virus primarily infects the respiratory tract.

""This is a powerful way to get both systemic and mucosal immunity,"" Dr. Frances Lund, a researcher on the AdCOVID project, told CNN. ""The virus infects through the respiratory route, so if you can get the immune system to effectively neutralize in that area, it provides an added layer of protection.""

Another advantage of a nasal vaccine is that it is needle-free, making it easier to administer and removing the need for healthcare professionals to administer the vaccine. It is also a potential solution for improving vaccine accessibility in low and middle-income countries, where resources for vaccine distribution can be scarce.

While the potential benefits are significant, there are also challenges to the development of a nasal vaccine. One major issue is ensuring that the vaccine is delivered in a consistent and controlled way.

""When you're delivering a vaccine through the nose, you have to make sure that you're getting it in the right place and delivering the correct dose,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine researcher at Baylor College of Medicine. ""You also have to consider the risk of adverse effects, such as nasal irritation or inflammation, which can occur if the vaccine isn't formulated correctly.""

To address these challenges, researchers are experimenting with different delivery methods and formulations. One potential solution is the use of a spray rather than a dropper, which can improve the accuracy and consistency of vaccine delivery. Researchers are also exploring the use of adjuvants, which are substances that can enhance the immune response to the vaccine and potentially reduce the required dose.

Another important consideration is ensuring the safety of the vaccine. Some nasal vaccines have been associated with neurological side effects, including a nasal vaccine developed for H1N1 influenza that was discontinued in 2016. The AdCOVID researchers say that they are taking the necessary precautions to mitigate any potential risks.

""We are closely monitoring the safety profiles and making sure that any potential side effects are well understood and addressed,"" said Lund. ""But overall, the AdCOVID vaccine has a good safety profile in preclinical studies, and we are optimistic about its potential.""

The AdCOVID team is currently preparing to launch a Phase 1 clinical trial to test the vaccine in humans. The trial, which is set to begin in the coming months, will enroll around 60 participants and evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of different doses and delivery methods. If successful, the researchers plan to move on to larger-scale trials later this year.

""We are cautiously optimistic that this vaccine will be effective,"" said Lund. ""But we have a long way to go before we can say for certain. It's important to proceed carefully and thoroughly in the clinical testing process.""

The AdCOVID vaccine is just one of several nasal vaccines in development for Covid-19. Others include a candidate from the University of Cincinnati, which uses fragments of SARS-CoV-2 to generate an immune response, and a vaccine from the Indian company Bharat Biotech, which uses an inactivated form of the virus.

Overall, the development of a nasal vaccine represents an exciting new approach to the fight against Covid-19. While it is still in the early stages of development, the promising results in animal studies and the potential benefits of this approach highlight why this vaccine is worth exploring further. If successful in clinical trials, a nasal vaccine could be a game-changer in the ongoing battle against Covid-19, offering an alternative approach to protect against the virus while improving accessibility and reducing reliance on injections.",1

193,A Red Cross Snoopy T-shirt is going viral. It's prompting more young people to donate blood,"The humble t-shirt has evolved from just being a piece of clothing to becoming a powerful tool for promoting awareness of social issues. The latest trend that is taking the world by storm is the Red Cross Snoopy T-shirt, which is motivating more and more young people to donate blood.

The popularity of the Snoopy T-shirt has been driven by a viral campaign that was launched by the Red Cross. The campaign encourages young people to donate blood by using colorful and unique t-shirts to grab attention.

These T-shirts are being shared on social media by the volunteers and donors alike, their bright red color is easily recognized and their prominent Snoopy design entices others to try and acquire their own.

The Red Cross states that the goal of the campaign is to encourage young people to donate blood and to help raise awareness about the importance of regular blood donations. Blood donations are essential for various medical procedures such as organ transplant surgery, cancer treatment, and trauma care, among others.

Statistics show that only a small percentage of Americans donate blood regularly, mostly older individuals aged 50 or older. The need for younger individuals to donate blood is essential, as they will be able to give for a longer period of time.

The Snoopy T-shirt campaign is one way to address this issue by incentivizing younger generations to donate blood. Young people are always on the lookout for the latest fashion trend, and the Red Cross has capitalized on that by introducing trendy, comfortable, and stylish T-shirts that young people can wear proudly while donating blood.

The Snoopy design of the T-shirt is especially attractive to younger individuals, many of whom grew up watching Peanuts comics and animated TV shows. This nostalgic appeal, combined with the bright and attractive design of the T-shirt, has made it a must-have item for many young people who see it as an opportunity to give back to their communities.

The social media aspect of the campaign has been instrumental in its success, as many young people are sharing their experiences with the T-shirt and encouraging their friends to donate blood as well. The use of social media influencers and celebrities has further amplified the message and has helped encourage more people to get involved with the campaign.

The Red Cross Snoopy T-shirt campaign has been a success, with the organization noting an increase in the number of first-time donors, as well as an increase in donations of blood from younger individuals. The campaign has helped spread awareness about the importance of donating blood and the impact that it can have on saving lives.

In conclusion, the Snoopy t-shirt campaign by the Red Cross has achieved its goal of motivating young people to donate blood by using the power of fashion and social media. In a world where social media trends and fashion fads are ever-present and influential, it is refreshing to see a campaign that leverages these trends for a good cause. The Red Cross Snoopy T-shirt has helped make donating blood cool and has started a conversation about the importance of blood donations among young people. This campaign is an inspiring example of how creativity, marketing, and social awareness can combine to make a real and positive impact on society.",1
194,Elon Musk's weekend antics could only further crumble Twitter's brand value,"Over the weekend, tech billionaire Elon Musk made headlines yet again with his erratic behavior on social media platform Twitter. In a series of tweets, he referred to himself as the ""Emperor of Mars,"" made comments about cryptocurrency Dogecoin, and even suggested that Twitter should be renamed ""Snitter.""

While this type of behavior may be par for the course from Musk, it has not gone unnoticed by Twitter users and critics alike. Many have taken to the platform to express their frustrations with Musk's antics, and some have even called for Twitter to take action against him.

This is not the first time Musk's Twitter activity has caused controversy. In 2018, he was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for fraud after tweeting that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. The tweet caused Tesla's stock price to surge, but it was later revealed that Musk had no such funding secured. He eventually settled with the SEC and stepped down as Tesla's chairman.

Musk's repeated displays of erratic behavior on Twitter have not only caused headaches for his own companies but also have the potential to further crumble Twitter's brand value. Twitter has been struggling in recent years with issues such as hate speech, misinformation, and toxic behavior on its platform. The platform has faced criticism for not doing enough to address these issues and has seen a decline in users as a result.

In this context, a high-profile user like Musk publicly disregarding the norms of Twitter adds to the platform's negative reputation. If Twitter fails to hold him accountable for his actions, it sends a message that even wealthy and powerful users can act with impunity and face no consequences for their behavior.

Twitter has already faced significant backlash for its handling of former President Donald Trump's account. Trump was banned from the platform after the January 6th Capitol insurrection, but critics argue that Twitter should have acted sooner and that his account enabled the spread of dangerous misinformation and incitement of violence.

If Twitter fails to take action against individuals like Musk who violate its policies and norms, it risks alienating even more users and further eroding its brand value. The platform's reputation has already taken a hit in recent years, with reports of cyberbullying, harassment, and other forms of toxic behavior driving many users away.

At the same time, however, Twitter faces a delicate balancing act when it comes to regulating user behavior. The platform has been criticized for its inconsistent enforcement of its policies, with some users facing consequences for relatively minor offenses while others seemingly get away with more egregious violations.

Furthermore, Twitter's role in regulating speech and behavior on its platform has become an increasingly pressing issue in the wake of the January 6th insurrection and broader concerns about the spread of extremist content online. Some critics argue that Twitter should take a more proactive role in policing its platform, while others argue that doing so would infringe on free speech and could do more harm than good.

Ultimately, the issue of how to regulate speech and behavior on social media platforms is a complex and nuanced one. However, regardless of where one falls on this issue, it is clear that Musk's weekend antics do not bode well for Twitter's brand value.

While Musk may be an extreme example, his behavior is indicative of a larger trend of high-profile users flouting the rules and norms of social media platforms. If Twitter is unable or unwilling to address this issue, it risks becoming synonymous with toxic behavior and driving even more users away.

For those who value the importance of social media as a tool for communication, information dissemination, and community building, this would be a disappointing outcome. However, unless platforms like Twitter take stronger action to regulate user behavior and enforce their policies, it may be unavoidable.",1
195,Florida death row inmate Louis Gaskin executed for 1989 murders,"Florida death row inmate Louis Gaskin was executed on Wednesday for the 1989 murders of two men in Miami-Dade County. Gaskin, 35, was pronounced dead at 6:38 pm at Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida. He was the 13th inmate to be executed in Florida since Gov. Ron DeSantis took office in January 2019.

Gaskin's execution was carried out despite opposition from his lawyers, who argued that his death sentence was unfair due to his intellectual disability. They also pointed to the fact that Gaskin confessed to the murders but claimed he did not act alone.

The case against Gaskin dates back to November 1989, when two men were shot and killed during a robbery at a car audio store in Miami-Dade County. Witnesses identified Gaskin as one of the gunmen, and he was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.

Gaskin's trial was controversial from the start, with his lawyers arguing that he was intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. However, the jury found him guilty on both counts and sentenced him to death.

Over the years, Gaskin's case has been the subject of numerous appeals and legal challenges, but every court upheld his death sentence. His execution was originally scheduled for earlier this year, but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Supporters of the death penalty argue that Gaskin's execution is a necessary punishment for his heinous crimes, and that justice has been served. However, opponents of capital punishment argue that the death penalty is a cruel and inhumane punishment, and that it should be abolished in all cases. The controversy surrounding Gaskin's case highlights the ongoing debate over the use of the death penalty in America.

In the end, Gaskin's execution serves as a reminder of the lasting impact of violent crime on individuals, families, and communities. While some may view his execution as a form of justice, others will undoubtedly continue to question the morality of the death penalty as a legal punishment.",1

198,'Everything has changed': Users of recalled eye drops describe permanent vision problems after infections,"The recent recall of certain eye drops has brought to light a disturbing trend among those who have used the product in the past. While many of us have likely used over-the-counter eye drops for various issues, including dryness and allergies, the recall serves as a stark reminder that not all products are created equal.

According to the recall notice, several lots of the Visine-A antihistamine and decongestant drops were recalled due to concerns over bacterial contamination. While the recall may seem like just another minor inconvenience, for some users, it has resulted in permanent vision problems. Those who have been affected by the tainted drops describe a range of symptoms, including blurred vision, dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and even partial or complete loss of vision.

One such user is Alice Jones*. A 35-year-old resident of Phoenix, Arizona, Jones says she began using the Visine-A drops about six months ago after developing a persistent case of dry eyes. At first, she says the drops seemed to help, and she didn't experience any adverse effects. However, after a few weeks of regular use, she says she began to notice changes in her vision.

""At first, it was just a little bit of blurriness here and there,"" Jones tells CNN. ""But then it started getting worse. I felt like I was looking through fog all the time, and I was experiencing a lot of discomfort in my eyes. They felt dry and scratchy all the time, even when I wasn't using the drops.""

Despite these symptoms, Jones continued to use the drops, assuming that they were still helping to relieve her dry eyes. It wasn't until the recall was announced that she realized the true source of her problems.

""I couldn't believe it when I saw the news,"" she says. ""I had no idea that the drops could be contaminated, or that they could cause permanent damage. It's been a really scary experience.""

Jones is far from alone in her experience. According to health officials, there have been numerous reports of eye infections linked to the Visine-A drops and other over-the-counter eye products. While most of these infections are easily treatable with antibiotics, a growing number of users are reporting long-term vision problems.

""Everything has changed,"" says John Smith*, a 42-year-old resident of Miami, Florida, who has also experienced vision problems after using the Visine-A drops. ""I used to be able to read small print without glasses, but now I can barely see anything. My eyes are always dry and irritated, and I'm constantly squinting and struggling to focus.""

Smith says he began using the drops about a year ago after developing what he thought was a mild case of seasonal allergies. However, after a few weeks of use, he says he began to notice changes in his vision, including increased sensitivity to light and difficulty reading.

""At first, I thought it was just my allergies acting up,"" he says. ""But then I realized that the drops were making things worse. I stopped using them right away, but the damage had already been done.""

For users like Jones and Smith, the recall has been a wake-up call about the potential dangers of over-the-counter eye drops. While these products are generally considered safe, experts say that they can be risky if used improperly or if they become contaminated.

""Eye drops, like any other medication, can have side effects and risks,"" says Dr. Anthony Johnson, an ophthalmologist with the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ""It's important for users to understand the risks and benefits of any product before using it, and to be aware of potential warning signs such as irritation, redness, or changes in vision.""

Johnson says that one of the biggest risks associated with eye drops is bacterial contamination, which can occur if the dropper comes into contact with the eye or other surfaces. This can lead to infections and other problems, particularly if the drops are used for an extended period of time.

""If you're using eye drops for more than a few days and you notice any changes in your vision or experience any discomfort or irritation, you should stop using the drops and see an eye doctor right away,"" he advises.

In addition to bacterial contamination, experts say that overuse of eye drops can also cause problems. While drops can be helpful for relieving symptoms like dryness and redness, frequent use can actually make these problems worse in the long run.

""Overuse of eye drops can lead to a condition called 'rebound redness,' where the eyes become even redder and more irritated than they were before,"" explains Johnson. ""This can create a vicious cycle where users feel like they need to use more and more drops just to get the same relief.""

To avoid these and other risks, experts advise users to follow the instructions on the product label carefully, and to seek medical attention if they experience any unusual symptoms. They also recommend storing eye drops in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, and avoiding using them past their expiration date.

For those who have already suffered vision problems as a result of using the recalled Visine-A drops, however, the damage may already be done. Jones says she has seen several doctors since her symptoms first appeared, but none have been able to offer a cure.

""It's been really frustrating,"" she says. ""I used to take my vision for granted, but now I realize how much I rely on it for everything. It's scary to think that something as simple as using eye drops could cause so much damage.""

Despite her experience, Jones says she isn't trying to discourage others from using eye drops altogether. Rather, she simply hopes that her story will encourage users to take the potential risks seriously and to be more vigilant about monitoring their symptoms.

""I don't want anyone else to go through what I've been through,"" she says. ""If I can help even one person avoid the same mistakes I made, it will be worth it.""",1
199,CDC investigates salmonella outbreak linked to flour,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently investigating a salmonella outbreak that has been linked to flour. The outbreak has resulted in at least 13 people being hospitalized, with one case being reported in Texas and another in Tennessee.

The CDC has reported that the strain of salmonella causing the outbreak is called Salmonella Typhimurium. This bacteria is commonly found in raw poultry and meat, but in this case, it has been found in flour.

The flour in question was produced by ADM Milling Company and was distributed to several states across the United States. The CDC has not yet identified which specific brand or type of flour is responsible for the outbreak.

The CDC advises individuals to avoid eating raw dough or batter, and to thoroughly wash their hands after handling uncooked food. They also recommend that individuals who have recently purchased flour from ADM Milling Company should check their packaging to make sure that it is not contaminated.

The symptoms of a salmonella infection include stomach cramps, fever, and diarrhea. In some cases, individuals may also experience nausea, vomiting, and headaches. These symptoms typically appear within 12-72 hours of infection and can last for up to a week.

The CDC has stated that anyone who believes they may have been infected with salmonella should seek medical attention immediately.

Outbreaks like this demonstrate the importance of proper food safety measures in the production, handling, and transportation of food products. The CDC and other public health agencies continue to work together to investigate and prevent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.

If you have recently purchased flour from ADM Milling Company, it is important to exercise caution when handling and preparing food products. The CDC recommends that consumers throw away any flour that may be contaminated and thoroughly clean any equipment or surfaces that may have come into contact with the contaminated flour.",1
200,Uber is funding an e-bike trade-in program to curb battery fires,"Uber has announced a new initiative to address the growing concern over e-bike battery fires. The ride-hailing giant will provide funding for an e-bike trade-in program to promote the safe disposal of older model bikes that may have faulty batteries.

The e-bike market has exploded in recent years, with Uber launching its own platform, Jump, in 2018. However, a series of high-profile incidents involving e-bike fires have raised concerns about their safety.

Last year, the New York City Fire Department issued a warning after a spate of e-bike battery explosions in the city, advising owners to properly dispose of old batteries and not to leave them unattended while charging. Several other cities have reported similar incidents, including San Francisco and London.

In response to the growing problem, Uber has pledged to fund a trade-in program that will allow riders to swap outdated e-bikes with newer, more reliable models. The program will also provide a safe way to dispose of older bikes, mitigating the risk of battery-related incidents.

""We take the safety of our riders and the community very seriously,"" said Eric Meyhofer, CEO of Uber's Advanced Technologies Group. ""While the incidence of battery fires is rare, we want to take proactive steps to address this issue and ensure that our riders feel safe when using Jump bikes.""

Under the program, riders will be able to bring in their old bikes to a participating Jump hub and receive a discount on a new e-bike. The discount will vary depending on the age and condition of the bike being traded in, with older and more worn bikes receiving a higher discount.

The program will launch initially in several US cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Washington DC, with plans to expand to other markets in the future.

""We're excited to launch this program as a way to promote rider safety and sustainability,"" said Tia Ray, Senior Director of Policy & Partnerships at Jump. ""By encouraging riders to dispose of their old bikes in a safe and responsible way, we can ensure that e-bikes remain a safe and viable transportation option for years to come.""

The move has been widely welcomed by safety advocates, who have long called for greater efforts to address the potential hazards of e-bike batteries.

""Any effort to improve e-bike safety is a step in the right direction,"" said Paul Steely White, Executive Director of Transportation Alternatives, a New York City advocacy group. ""We applaud Uber for taking the lead on this issue and encouraging riders to upgrade to newer, safer models.""

The e-bike trade-in program is just the latest in a series of measures taken by Uber to improve rider safety. Last year, the company launched a new Jump bike design, featuring a replaceable battery system and tamper-proof locking mechanism, in an effort to address concerns about theft and battery-related issues. Uber also introduced a number of new safety features across its platform, including voice-activated commands and an emergency button that connects riders directly to 911.

Despite these efforts, e-bike safety remains a complex and challenging issue. E-bikes have grown in popularity in part due to their ability to provide a low-carbon alternative to traditional modes of transportation. However, the technology is complex and requires careful handling in order to prevent accidents and battery-related incidents.

As cities around the world encourage the use of e-bikes as a sustainable, efficient mode of transportation, it is critical that riders are provided with the resources and support necessary to ensure they are used safely. Uber's e-bike trade-in program is a significant step towards this goal, but more will need to be done to address the broader challenges of e-bike safety.

For now, however, it is a positive development in a rapidly evolving market. By promoting sustainable, reliable, and safe transportation options, Uber is demonstrating its commitment to improving the lives of riders and communities around the world.",1
201,Make your own bed: will less daily housekeeping hurt the hotel business?,"As more hotels reduce their daily housekeeping services, some guests are questioning the value of their stay. Many hotels are implementing ""Make Your Own Bed"" policies, encouraging guests to reuse towels and skip daily cleaning services to save water and energy. However, some travelers are willing to pay a premium for daily housekeeping and worry that these policies may negatively impact the perception of hotels as a luxury experience. While it remains to be seen if these policies will result in lower revenue, hotels must balance sustainability with guest expectations to remain competitive.",1
202,The Texas pardons board is investigating after GOP governor's request in case of sergeant convicted of killing protester at 2020 BLM rally,"The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is investigating a request for clemency in the case of a sergeant convicted of killing a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally last year. The request was made by Republican Governor Greg Abbott last week, and has sparked widespread outrage.

Sergeant Daniel Perry, a member of the Texas National Guard, was on his way to pick up a friend when he encountered a protest in downtown Austin on July 25, 2020. As he tried to turn his vehicle around, he was confronted by Garrett Foster, a 28-year-old who had been participating in the protest with his fiancée.

According to Perry's account of events, Foster approached his car with an AK-47 rifle and pointed it at him. Perry, who was also armed, fired his weapon in self-defense. Foster was struck multiple times and later died at the scene.

Perry was charged with murder and indicted by a grand jury, but his lawyers argued that he acted in self-defense and that Foster's actions were threatening. After a trial in April of this year, Perry was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Governor Abbott's request for clemency, which was sent to the Board of Pardons and Paroles last week, has sparked intense criticism from those who believe that Perry's conviction was just and that the governor's request represents an attempt to undermine the criminal justice system.

Critics point to Abbott's longstanding opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement and his vocal support for law enforcement as evidence that his request for clemency is politically motivated.

""Governor Abbott's request for clemency is an example of the worst kind of politics: using one's power to protect the powerful and undermine justice,"" said Reverend Dr. William J. Barber II, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign.

Barber noted that Perry's trial and conviction had been conducted with due process and that his guilt had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. ""There is no justification for a governor to intervene in this case except to try to manipulate the outcome for political gain,"" he said.

Others have pointed to the racial dynamics of the case, noting that the victim, Garrett Foster, was a white man who was supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, while Perry, the shooter, is white and a member of law enforcement.

""The fact that Governor Abbott is using his power to try to get clemency for a white man who killed a white man at a Black Lives Matter rally says a lot about where his priorities lie,"" said Celeste Castillo Lee of the Texas Organizing Project. ""This is about protecting the police and attacking those who are calling for justice.""

Abbott's office has defended his request for clemency, saying that he believes Perry acted in self-defense and that the 30-year sentence is excessive.

""The governor believes that the evidence in this case supports a finding of self-defense, and that Sergeant Perry should not have to spend the next 30 years of his life behind bars,"" said Renae Eze, a spokesperson for Abbott.

Eze noted that Abbott has previously granted clemency requests for other inmates who were believed to have been wrongfully convicted or who had received excessively harsh sentences.

But critics say that the circumstances of Perry's case are different, and that Governor Abbott's request is not grounded in a desire for justice but in political expediency.

""This is a blatant attempt by Governor Abbott to pander to his base and score political points,"" said Lee. ""He should be ashamed of himself.""

The Board of Pardons and Paroles has not yet made a decision on whether to grant Perry clemency, and it is unclear when a decision might be reached.

In the meantime, advocates for justice reform and racial justice say they will continue to monitor the case and speak out against what they see as an attempt to undermine the integrity of the criminal justice system.

""This case is about more than just one man and one incident,"" said Barber. ""It's about the future of our democracy and our ability to hold those in power accountable for their actions. We will not stand idly by while Governor Abbott tries to subvert justice for his own political gain.""",1
203,"Customs officers in Philadelphia seize nearly $200K worth of counterfeit auto parts, including air bag covers","Customs officers in Philadelphia have made another significant seizure of counterfeit auto parts, including air bag covers, that the authorities say are worth nearly $200,000. The seizure follows a crackdown on the trade in fake goods that last year netted officers over 27,000 counterfeit items in the region, including knock-off designer clothes, shoes, and jewelry.

The US Customs and Border Protection agency said that the latest shipment contained a variety of counterfeit items that included airbag covers, sensors, and other auto parts. The goods were being shipped from China and had been falsely labeled to indicate that they were legitimate auto parts.

Customs officials believe that the counterfeiters are using increasingly sophisticated methods to evade detection and that there is a growing danger to the public from the use of fake airbags. Many of these cheap copies have been found to be either completely ineffective or to actually cause harm to drivers and passengers.

The Philadelphia customs office has been working closely with law enforcement officials across the country to share information and build cases against counterfeiters. The latest seizure is just one example of the success of these efforts and reinforces the commitment of the US government to protect consumers from the dangers of fake goods.

Counterfeit goods cost the global economy billions of dollars every year, and the US government is determined to keep this trade in check. The latest seizure in Philadelphia is a clear indication that the authorities are taking this issue seriously and will continue to work tirelessly to keep consumers safe from the risks posed by fake goods.",1

205,Shares in Regal Cinemas' owner hit all-time low,"Shares in Regal Cinemas' owner, Cineworld Group, hit an all-time low on Monday, as the company grapples with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business.

The UK-based business owns Regal Cinemas, the second largest theater chain in the United States, as well as cinemas across the UK and Europe. However, the company has struggled to stay afloat during the pandemic, with theaters forced to close and movie releases postponed.

Cineworld's shares plummeted more than 35% on Monday, trading at just over 15 pence per share. The company's market value now stands at just £160 million ($209 million), down from £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) at the start of the year.

In a statement released Monday, Cineworld said that it was considering ""all options available to it"" to address its financial challenges.

""We continue to monitor the situation closely and are in active discussions with our lenders,"" the company said. ""We remain focused on managing our cash resources to ensure that we can navigate through this period and emerge in a strong position.""

The news is the latest blow for the cinema industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. Many theaters have been forced to close for months at a time, and even as they begin to reopen, it is unclear when they will be able to operate at full capacity again.

Movie studios have also postponed the release of several highly anticipated films, including the latest installment in the James Bond franchise, ""No Time to Die,"" and Disney's ""Mulan."" A lack of blockbuster releases has made it difficult for theaters to attract customers and generate revenue.

Regal Cinemas announced last month that it would be temporarily closing all of its US theaters, citing the lack of new releases and the ongoing impact of the pandemic. The company has not said when it expects to reopen its cinemas.

Industry experts have warned that the pandemic could permanently alter the landscape of the movie industry, with some suggesting that theaters may never fully recover.

For Cineworld and Regal Cinemas, the road ahead looks uncertain. While the company has said it is exploring all options, it is clear that significant changes will be needed to keep the business afloat in the coming months.",1
206,Some ready-to-eat salads with chicken or ham may contain potentially deadly listeria,"Consumers who are pressed for time and prefer to have a healthy meal on-the-go should pay heed to the recent warning issued by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service. The warning states that certain ready-to-eat salads that come with chicken or ham may contain listeria monocytoenes, a type of bacteria that can cause severe illness and even death.

According to the USDA, the affected products were made by the company Mary’s Harvest Fresh Foods, a National City, California-based food processor. The recalled products include salads featuring chicken or ham, sold in plastic containers carried by retailers across the US. The products’ use-by dates range from October 12 to October 18, and have a label marked with the establishment number “P-39928” inside the USDA mark of inspection.

The potential contamination was discovered during routine testing by the USDA, though there have been no reports of any illnesses caused by consumption of these salads. Nevertheless, the USDA says consumers should take caution and not eat the contaminated products.

Listeria can cause a serious illness called listeriosis, which usually manifests 1-4 weeks after consumption, but can take as long as 70 days. The symptoms are similar to those of flu and include fever, muscle aches, and nausea. In pregnant women, listeriosis can cause a miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe illness in the newborn. Elderly people, young children, and people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to severe infection and can even die from the illness.

Recalls of food products are quite common, and often, they are initiated voluntarily by manufacturers. However, in certain cases, the USDA and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can impose mandatory recalls. Such recalls are rare and usually reserved for cases where the potential harm to public health is severe.

The USDA recommends that consumers who have bought the affected salads should discard them or return them to the place of purchase for a refund. Food safety agencies also encourage consumers to wash their hands and any surfaces that may have come in contact with the contaminated products.

It is important to note that proper food safety procedures can go a long way in reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. These procedures include regular handwashing, keeping raw foods separate from cooked foods, cooking food to the proper temperature, and storing food at the right temperature.

Even though the recall affects only a limited range of products, it highlights the potential dangers of foodborne illnesses, especially in ready-to-eat foods. Consumers who practice caution and scrutinize the labels of the foods they buy can avoid falling ill from contaminated food products. As always, in case of any illness, it is important to seek medical attention promptly.",1
207,A Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its shelves is set to consider shutting down its library system,"In a shocking turn of events, a Texas county that was recent ordered to return banned books to its shelves is now considering shutting down its library system altogether. The move has sparked outrage in the community as it would deny citizens access to important knowledge and resources.

The controversy began when the library system in the city of Leander, located in Williamson County, was ordered to remove several books from its shelves by the county judge's office. The books in question included works by prominent authors such as Margaret Atwood and David Levithan, and were deemed to be inappropriate for young readers.

After receiving backlash from the community and free speech advocates, a federal judge ruled that the county must return the banned books to the shelves. However, this victory for intellectual freedom has now been overshadowed by the potential closure of the library system altogether.

The proposal to shut down the Leander library system is part of a larger debate over the county's budget cuts. Officials have cited financial strain as the reason for the potential closure, but many community members are questioning why the library system is being targeted.

According to local resident and library patron Tara Brown, ""Our library system is an essential part of our community. It's where people go to learn, to connect with others, and to improve their lives. It's unconscionable to think that the county would even consider shutting it down.""

Brown's sentiment is shared by many in the community, who believe that the library system provides crucial resources and opportunities for citizens of all ages. Among the services offered by Leander's libraries are literacy programs for children, free computer access, and job search assistance.

Aside from the obvious loss of these valuable resources, the closure of the library system would also have a devastating impact on the county's economy. According to a study conducted by the American Library Association, for every $1 invested in public libraries, communities see a return of $5 or more in socioeconomic benefits.

Furthermore, library closures often result in widespread job loss, as many librarians and support staff positions are eliminated. In a time of economic uncertainty, it seems unwise to take away jobs in a field that has proven to be so beneficial to communities.

Despite community efforts to save the library system, officials have yet to provide a clear answer as to how they plan to address the budget concerns. In the meantime, many residents are left feeling frustrated and uncertain about the future of their community.

As the debate over the county's budget continues, it's important to remember the critical role that public libraries play in our society. They provide access to knowledge and resources that might otherwise be unavailable to certain populations, and they foster a sense of community and connection that is becoming increasingly rare in our digital age.

It's up to us, as citizens and advocates of intellectual freedom, to fight for the preservation of our libraries and the valuable services they provide. We cannot allow the voices of a few to silence the important work that these institutions do every day.",1
208,Wall Street says bad news is no longer good news. Here's why,"In a surprising shift, Wall Street has suddenly stopped reacting positively to bad news. For years, investors have often cheered when bad economic data was released, as it meant the Federal Reserve would likely provide more stimulus. However, this trend seems to be changing, and the reasoning behind this shift may surprise some.

For a long time, Wall Street has been operating under the belief that ""bad news is good news."" This refers to the idea that if the economy is faltering or struggling, the Federal Reserve will step in and lower interest rates or provide other forms of stimulus to keep the economy afloat. This creates a sort of safety net for investors, as even if things appear to be dire, they can count on the Fed to provide some sort of cushion.

This trend started during the Great Recession in 2008 and continued throughout the past decade. Any time there was a piece of bad news, whether it was related to the economy, politics, or even a company-specific issue, investors would often see it as a positive, as it meant the Fed would step in and help stimulate the market.

However, this year, things seem to be different. Investors are no longer cheering bad news, and instead, they are reacting negatively. This was particularly evident when the latest jobs report came out in early September, showing that the economy only added back 1.4 million jobs in August, a far cry from the 1.7 million that were expected. Instead of rallying in anticipation of the Fed's response, the stock market actually fell by more than 2% on the day of the report's release.

So why is this happening? Why are investors suddenly reacting differently to bad news, and what does it mean for the future of the stock market?

One theory is that the market has reached a sort of ""peak stimulus."" After years of Fed intervention, investors may be starting to realize that the central bank's options for propping up the market are limited. Interest rates are already at zero, and the Fed's balance sheet has ballooned to over $7 trillion. With such a limited toolkit, investors may be starting to realize that the Fed may not be able to step in and save the market like it has in the past.

Another theory is that investors are starting to view the current situation as a ""new normal."" After months of living with the pandemic, investors may be starting to accept that the economy will be struggling for months or even years to come. Rather than hoping for a quick fix from the Fed, investors are starting to brace for a longer, tougher road ahead. This makes bad news less palatable, as it confirms that the struggles of the past few months are likely to continue.

A third theory is that investors are starting to focus on company-specific issues, rather than macroeconomic trends. In the past, bad news was often seen as a positive because it meant the Fed would step in and help the market as a whole. However, investors may now be registering more concern about individual companies and their ability to weather the storm. For example, the recent news that movie theater chain AMC may be on the brink of bankruptcy caused the stock to fall by more than 10%, even as the broader market held relatively steady. This suggests that investors may be looking beyond the macroeconomic picture and focusing more on specific companies and sectors.

Regardless of the reason behind the shift, it is clear that the old adage of ""bad news is good news"" no longer applies. Investors are not looking at bad news with the same optimism as before, and instead, they are reacting with caution and concern. This has the potential to create a more volatile market, as investors try to make sense of a shifting landscape.

So what does this mean for the average investor? There are a few things to keep in mind. First, it is important to remember that the market is not always rational. Just because bad news is no longer being cheered doesn't mean that the market will always react in a logical way. There may still be unexpected swings and turns, so it is important to stay vigilant.

Second, it is important to keep a long-term perspective. Bad news can be difficult to stomach in the moment, but investors who have a longer horizon can often weather the storm. By focusing on fundamentals and looking at the big picture, investors can often find opportunities even in tough times.

Finally, it is important to remain diversified. The shifting market landscape means that what worked in the past may not work in the future. By diversifying across a variety of asset classes and sectors, investors can reduce their exposure to risk and potentially find new opportunities for growth.

In conclusion, the shift away from the old adage of ""bad news is good news"" is significant and has the potential to create a more volatile market. However, by keeping a level head, focusing on fundamentals, and diversifying portfolios, investors can navigate this new landscape and potentially find new opportunities for growth.",1
209,Iowa's attorney general has paused funding for sexual assault victims' Plan B and abortions,"In an unexpected move, Iowa's Attorney General, Tom Miller, has halted funding for sexual assault victims' Plan B and abortion treatments. This decision has led to an outrage not only in Iowa but across the nation with many people terming it as an assault on women's rights.

Under Miller's watch, the state of Iowa had a program that offered assistance to women who had been sexually assaulted. The program covered a range of reproductive services, such as Plan B and abortions. However, Miller recently paused funding for these services. According to his spokesperson, Lynn Hicks, the move was meant to comply with a new state law that requires the attorney general to get approval from the governor before authorizing payments of over $50,000.

Despite this explanation, many people see Miller's decision as a deliberate attempt to roll back reproductive rights. Sexual assault victims who seek abortions or Plan B treatments need to have access to these services quickly, and the delay caused by the new policy could have serious impacts on their health and wellbeing.

Nancy Northup, the CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, has strongly criticized Miller for the decision. In a statement, she called the move ""shameful,"" noting that women deserve better. She added that sexual assault survivors deserve compassionate care and support from the state, saying that Miller's actions have put these women in danger.

Miller's decision comes at a time when reproductive rights are under attack across the country. States like Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio have recently passed laws banning abortions, even in cases of rape and incest. These laws directly challenge the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which established a woman's right to choose abortion in the United States. Many legal experts believe that the wave of anti-abortion laws is a concerted effort to overturn Roe v. Wade by the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court.

Iowa has itself faced challenges to its reproductive rights protections in recent years. In 2018, Governor Kim Reynolds signed a ""fetal heartbeat bill"" into law that bans abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks of pregnancy. The law was immediately challenged by Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, which argued that it violated the state's constitution. However, the law was allowed to take effect while the legal challenge proceeded in court.

In June of this year, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down the fetal heartbeat law, ruling that it violated the state constitution's protections for women's rights. The ruling was a win for reproductive rights advocates, but it is clear that the fight is not over. The Trump administration has also taken steps to roll back reproductive rights protections at the federal level. The administration has proposed a rule that would allow healthcare workers to refuse to provide abortion services on religious or moral grounds.

The decision by Tom Miller to pause funding for reproductive services for sexual assault survivors is another troubling sign for women's rights in Iowa and across the nation. Sexual assault is already an incredibly traumatic experience for survivors, and the last thing they need is more barriers to access care. It is imperative that politicians and policymakers prioritize the health and wellbeing of sexual assault survivors.

In conclusion, Miller's decision to halt funding for reproductive services for sexual assault survivors is not only unacceptable but also dangerous. Women who have been sexually assaulted deserve compassionate care and support from the state, and reproductive services should be a part of that care. We must stand up for the reproductive rights of all women and fight against any attempts to roll back these hard-won protections. Any policy that seeks to limit women's rights must be challenged and ultimately overturned. We must not let our hard-fought victories for women's rights be reversed.",1
210,"'Equal opportunity to be healthy': Stricter air pollution standards would benefit some populations more than others, study says","Air pollution is a persistent problem across the globe, with the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating that around 7 million people die each year from the exposure to polluted air. However, not all communities are equally affected by air pollution. Low-income and marginalized communities, as well as people of color, are often exposed to higher levels of pollution due to systemic inequalities in infrastructure and urban planning. A new study suggests that strict air pollution standards could help address these disparities, but not all populations would benefit equally.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, analyzed data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on air pollution levels and demographic characteristics in the country. The researchers focused on three pollutants that have been linked to a range of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, and lung cancer: fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone.

Using a statistical model, they estimated the health impacts of reducing pollution levels to meet the current EPA standards and compared it to the potential benefits of stricter standards. The results showed that more stringent regulations could have significant health benefits, particularly for vulnerable populations.

""Stricter air pollution standards have the potential to reduce health inequalities by providing an equal opportunity to be healthy,"" says lead author Christopher Tessum, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""However, not all populations are created equal and not all health benefits are equal.""

The study found that African Americans and low-income individuals would experience the greatest health benefits from stricter standards, as they are more likely to live in areas with high levels of pollution. For example, reducing fine particulate matter to meet the current EPA standard would prevent about 35,000 premature deaths each year. However, if the standard were tightened, an additional 15,000 deaths could be averted annually, with 4,900 of those being African Americans.

The researchers also looked at how health benefits varied by age and gender. They found that children and adults over 65 would benefit the most from stricter pollution regulations. Women would also experience greater health benefits than men, likely due to gender differences in how pollution affects the body.

While the study's findings are promising, they also highlight the potential drawbacks of air pollution regulations. The researchers found that stricter standards would increase the cost of energy production, primarily due to the need to install new pollution control technologies or shift to cleaner energy sources. This, in turn, could lead to an increase in energy prices, which would disproportionately affect low-income households.

""Stricter pollution standards are not a panacea,"" Tessum says. ""We need to be mindful of their economic impacts, especially on vulnerable populations.""

Despite these challenges, the case for stricter air pollution standards has become increasingly compelling in recent years. A growing body of research has linked exposure to pollution with a range of health problems, from asthma to obesity. Studies have also shown that air pollution can weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to infectious diseases like COVID-19.

In response, many countries and regions around the world have started to implement stricter pollution regulations. In the US, the Trump administration rolled back many of the Obama-era regulations aimed at reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants and other sources. However, President Joe Biden has pledged to reinstate and strengthen these regulations, with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

The health benefits of these efforts would be significant, according to the American Lung Association. In a recent report, the organization estimated that meeting the current EPA standards for fine particulate matter alone would prevent over 40,000 premature deaths each year. However, stricter regulations would be even more effective, potentially saving millions of lives over the next few decades.

The study's authors hope that their findings will help policymakers make more informed decisions about air pollution regulations.

""Our study shows that there is a strong health case for stricter pollution standards, especially for vulnerable populations,"" Tessum says. ""By taking action on air pollution, we can improve public health and create a more equal society.""",1
211,Penn State Scandal Fast Facts,"Penn State Scandal Fast Facts

The Penn State scandal, which engulfed the university from 2011 to 2012, remains one of the most shocking and tragic episodes in modern American sports history. It centered around the actions of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was found guilty of sexually abusing young boys while he was still employed by the university.

The scandal rocked the Penn State community and the world of college sports as a whole, revealing deep-seated issues with the university’s administration and a broken culture that enabled Sandusky’s behavior to go unchecked for years.

Here are the key facts and developments surrounding the Penn State scandal:

Jerry Sandusky’s rise and fall:

- Jerry Sandusky was a longtime assistant football coach at Penn State under head coach Joe Paterno. He was lauded for his work with children through his Second Mile charity organization, which provided counseling and support to at-risk youth.

- Sandusky retired from Penn State in 1999 but remained closely associated with the program, regularly attending games and participating in team events.

- In 2011, Sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing young boys over a period of several years. An investigation by state police and grand jury had uncovered evidence against Sandusky, including testimony from several of his victims.

- Sandusky was ultimately found guilty on 45 counts of sexual abuse, including rape and molestation, and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.

- The trial revealed stunning details of Sandusky’s crimes, including multiple instances of abuse on Penn State’s campus, in the football team’s locker room, and even in the shower room.

- Following Sandusky’s conviction, several high-profile Penn State officials were also charged with crimes related to the scandal, including former university president Graham Spanier, athletic director Tim Curley, and vice president Gary Schultz.

The university’s response:

- The Penn State scandal brought scrutiny to the university’s leadership and its handling of the allegations against Sandusky. Many criticized the school for failing to act on warning signs and for prioritizing the football program over the safety of its students.

- Penn State’s response to the scandal was initially led by Joe Paterno, who was informed of the allegations against Sandusky in 2001 but did not take sufficient action to ensure Sandusky was held accountable. Paterno was fired by the university in November 2011 amid mounting public pressure and criticism.

- Penn State also commissioned an independent investigation, known as the Freeh Report, to explore the university’s response to the scandal. The report, released in 2012, found that Paterno, Spanier, Curley, and Schultz had all failed to act on the evidence against Sandusky and had created a culture of secrecy and cover-up.

- The Freeh Report also faulted the university’s board of trustees for its inaction and lack of accountability in the wake of the scandal. The board ultimately implemented a series of reforms to improve transparency and oversight, including the creation of new committees focused on ethical governance and risk management.

The fallout:

- The Penn State scandal had far-reaching implications for the university and the world of college sports. In addition to the criminal charges and legal battles that followed, there were widespread calls for greater accountability and transparency at colleges and universities across the country.

- The NCAA, the governing body for college athletics, handed down severe sanctions against Penn State in response to the scandal. These included a $60 million fine, a four-year postseason ban for the football team, and the vacating of all wins from the 1998-2011 seasons.

- The scandal also led to a number of civil lawsuits against Penn State and its officials, resulting in millions of dollars in settlements and payouts.

- The Penn State scandal continues to be a source of controversy and debate, with some arguing that the university has yet to fully account for its role in enabling Sandusky’s abuse and for failing to protect its students. Others have praised the reforms and changes implemented in the wake of the scandal as a positive step forward for transparency and accountability in college sports.

Conclusion:

The Penn State scandal was a tragic and shocking episode in American sports history that exposed deep-seated issues with the university’s administration and culture. The actions of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky – and the failure of Penn State officials to take action against him when warned – had far-reaching consequences for the university and the world of college sports.

While the scandal exposed the worst aspects of a broken system, it also prompted reforms and changes that have improved oversight and accountability at Penn State and in college sports more broadly. However, the events of 2011-2012 should serve as a stark reminder of the need for vigilance in protecting vulnerable populations and for swift and decisive action in the face of wrongdoing.",1

Vanessa Redgrave is a versatile and accomplished actress, known for her distinguished career in film, stage, and television. She has won numerous awards and accolades throughout her decades-long career, making her one of the most respected and admired actresses of her generation. Here are some fast facts about Vanessa Redgrave that highlight her impressive achievements and contributions to the world of entertainment.

Early Life and Career

Vanessa Redgrave was born on January 30, 1937, in London, England. She was born into a family of actors, with both her parents and siblings active in the profession. Her mother, Rachel Kempson, was a British actress, while her father, Michael Redgrave, was a legendary stage and film actor.

214,Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's health deteriorates in prison amid poisoning accusations,"Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's health continues to deteriorate in prison, prompting concerns from his supporters and human rights organizations. This comes after Navalny was arrested in January and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for violating the terms of his probation from a 2014 embezzlement conviction, a charge that he and his followers say is politically motivated.

While in prison, Navalny has reportedly been suffering from severe back pain and numbness in his legs, symptoms he attributes to a shortage of medical care. According to his team, he has also been on a hunger strike since March 31, demanding to receive medical treatment outside the prison from his own doctors.

Navalny's situation has escalated in recent days as he was moved to a prison hospital due to his deteriorating condition. His supporters have accused prison officials of withholding proper medical assistance and blocking any possibility of outside doctors seeing him. Navalny's lawyers were denied access to him in the hospital for two days, further fueling concerns about his wellbeing.

Navalny's spokesman, Kira Yarmysh, said on Twitter on April 19 that ""Navalny is dying ... He asks that a doctor be allowed to see him immediately."" Yarmysh also claimed that Navalny has lost 15kg since starting his hunger strike and that he is in considerable pain. The same day, Navalny's team called for nationwide protests on April 21 to demand that he be given proper medical care.

The situation has been exacerbated by accusations that Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok last year. Navalny was flown to Germany for treatment after falling ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow in August 2020. German officials confirmed that he was poisoned with Novichok, a chemical nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union.

Navalny has accused Russia's security services of poisoning him, an allegation that the Kremlin has denied. While the Russian government did not officially open an investigation into the poisoning, it has repeatedly said that it has seen no proof of foul play.

Navalny's situation has drawn international attention, with the US government and other countries calling for his immediate release and proper medical care. The EU has also imposed sanctions on Russia over Navalny's treatment and the poisoning allegations.

As Navalny's health continues to decline, his supporters are determined to raise awareness and demand action from the Russian government. While the situation remains uncertain, it is clear that the fate of one of Russia's most prominent opposition figures remains in the balance.",1

216,What we know about the Daniel Perry case and what happens next after Texas' governor says he wants to pardon him,"Daniel Perry, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army, has been in the news lately after Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he wants to pardon him. Perry faces a murder charge for the shooting death of 39-year-old Garrett Foster during a protest in Austin last summer. Here's what we know about the case and what could happen next. 

What happened during the protest?

On July 25, 2020, a group of protesters gathered at Congress Avenue and Fourth Street in Austin, Texas, to protest police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Foster, who was a regular participant in protests, attended the demonstration with his fiancée, Whitney Mitchell. 

Foster was armed with an AK-47 rifle, which he legally purchased earlier that month, and a magazine of ammunition. He wore a black bandana around his neck and carried a first-aid kit in a sling over his right shoulder. 

Perry, who was driving for Uber at the time, encountered the protest while on his way to pick up a passenger. He had a handgun in his car, which he legally owned and had a concealed carry permit for. 

At some point, Perry's vehicle and Foster's group crossed paths. According to Perry's attorney, Foster approached Perry's car and pointed his rifle at him. Perry, in fear for his life, fired his handgun multiple times, striking Foster. Foster later died at the hospital. Perry stayed at the scene and cooperated with police. 

What charges is Perry facing?

Following an investigation by the Austin Police Department and the Travis County District Attorney's Office, Perry was indicted on a charge of murder in September 2020. He turned himself in to authorities and was released on a $300,000 bond. 

The case has not gone to trial yet, but Perry's attorneys have argued that he acted in self-defense and are seeking to have the charges against him dropped. 

What has Governor Abbott said about the case?

On June 17, 2021, Governor Abbott tweeted that he wants to pardon Perry. He said, ""I don't know all the facts but I can tell you that it's unlike Texas to allow this kind of lawlessness. And that's why, as governor, I am committed to backing the blue and to my core values of law and order. Anybody out there who may be thinking about defunding the police or taking the law into their own hands, I want you to hear this loud and clear: In Texas, we back the blue. And we will not allow that to change.""

Abbott's tweet was met with criticism from some who argued that it was inappropriate for the governor to comment on a case that is still pending. Others pointed out that Abbott had not even bothered to learn the facts of the case before speaking out about it. There is no legal mechanism for Abbott to pardon someone who has not yet been convicted of a crime, and some legal experts have said that his comments could be seen as an attempt to influence the outcome of Perry's trial. 

What happens next?

The case is currently in pretrial proceedings. Perry's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him, arguing that he acted in self-defense and that the evidence does not support a charge of murder. They are also seeking to have the prosecutor removed from the case, alleging bias. 

If the charges are not dismissed, Perry's case will go to trial. A judge will determine whether or not Perry's actions constituted self-defense and whether or not he is guilty of murder. If he is found guilty, he could face life in prison. 

It's unclear at this point whether or not Abbott's comments will have any impact on the outcome of the case. Some legal experts have said that his statements could be used by Perry's attorneys to argue that their client cannot get a fair trial in Texas. Others have argued that Abbott's intervention is unlikely to make a difference given the strength of the evidence against Perry. 

What are the larger issues at play in this case?

The Perry case is just one example of the tension between protesters and those who oppose them, including law enforcement and civilians who feel threatened by protests. Supporters of Perry argue that he was acting in self-defense and that his actions were justified given the perceived threat he faced. Others argue that Perry should have simply avoided the protest entirely rather than putting himself in a potentially dangerous situation. 

The case also highlights the ongoing debate over gun rights in America. Foster was legally allowed to carry his rifle, but some have argued that the mere presence of a weapon at a protest can be intimidating and increase tensions between protesters and bystanders. Others argue that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right that should not be infringed upon. 

Finally, the case raises questions about the role of law enforcement in protests. The Austin Police Department has come under fire in recent years for its handling of protests and the use of force against protesters. Some argue that Perry's actions were a direct result of the police department's failure to adequately control the situation. Others argue that protesters have a responsibility to protest peacefully and not put others in harm's way. 

Regardless of the outcome of the Perry case, it is clear that the larger issues at play are not going away anytime soon. As protests continue across the country and the debate over gun rights and police reform rages on, cases like this one will continue to highlight the deep divisions in American society.",1

218,"WHO warns new Omicron spinoff XBB.1.16 is 'one to watch,' but hasn't shown to be more severe","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning regarding a new spinoff of the Omicron variant, called XBB.1.16. Despite the concern, the organization has stated that there is no evidence to suggest that the new variant is more severe than the previous Omicron variant.

The WHO has been closely monitoring the spread of Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic, and the emergence of new variants has been an ongoing source of concern for global health organizations. While the Omicron variant has been dominant in recent months, scientists have continued to track new spinoffs of the virus.

XBB.1.16, which was first identified in Botswana, has been flagged as a variant to watch due to its high number of mutations. According to the WHO, the new variant has more than 32 mutations on its spike protein, which is more than the original strain of Covid-19.

However, the WHO has emphasized that there is no evidence to suggest that XBB.1.16 is more severe than previous variants. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, stated during a press briefing that ""there’s no indication at this time that there is increased severity or increased transmissibility or increased immune evasion associated with this variant.""

Despite the lack of evidence regarding the severity of the new variant, the WHO has emphasized the importance of continued vigilance in containing the spread of Covid-19. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's Director-General, has stressed that ""we need to be more careful and more vigilant than ever. We cannot let our guard down.""

As the global community continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, the emergence of new variants highlights the need for continued research, monitoring, and vaccination efforts. While XBB.1.16 is still being studied, the WHO's warning serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by Covid-19.",1

220,An elephant living in a Berlin zoo learns how to peel a banana,"The Berlin Zoo is home to many exotic animals from all around the world, each with their unique personalities and habits. But few have caught the attention of visitors like the elephant that learned how to peel a banana.

For the past few weeks, zoo-goers have been gathering around the elephant exhibit to watch as a female elephant named Zella carefully peels a banana before enjoying it. Many have been surprised to see such a large animal exhibiting such a human-like behavior.

According to the zookeepers, Zella learned how to peel a banana by observing them do it. Elephants are highly intelligent animals and are known to exhibit complex behaviors and even problem-solving skills.

Zookeepers have also noted that Zella is highly curious and often observes her surroundings intently, which may have contributed to her learning how to peel the fruit.

While this may seem like a relatively trivial behavior, it highlights the remarkable intelligence and adaptability of elephants in captivity. Despite living in an artificial environment, Zella has been able to develop a new skill through observation and experimentation.

Zookeepers have also noted that this behavior has had a positive impact on Zella's overall well-being. The mental stimulation provided by learning a new task has likely helped to reduce stress and strengthen her cognitive abilities.

However, not all elephants living in captivity are as fortunate as Zella. Many are forced to endure cramped living conditions, inadequate diets, and inadequate mental stimulation, leading to a range of physical and mental health problems.

The captivity of elephants has long been a contentious issue, with animal rights advocates arguing that these highly intelligent animals should not be held in captivity for human entertainment.

Despite these concerns, zoos continue to be a popular attraction for people of all ages, providing an opportunity to see rare and exotic animals up close.

But as our understanding of animal welfare and behaviors evolves, so too must our treatment of animals in captivity. Zoos must continue to invest in ensuring the physical and mental well-being of the animals in their care, providing adequate living conditions and opportunities for enrichment.

This includes providing elephants with ample space, a varied and nutritious diet, and opportunities for physical and mental stimulation. Zoos must also prioritize the conservation of these endangered animals in the wild, supporting efforts to protect their natural habitats and prevent their extinction.

While the case of Zella learning how to peel a banana is impressive, it is just a small example of the incredible behaviors and adaptations that these intelligent animals are capable of. It is up to us to provide them with the necessary conditions to thrive in captivity and in the wild.

In conclusion, the story of Zella the elephant learning how to peel a banana may seem like a small and simple feat, but it highlights the remarkable intelligence and adaptability of elephants in captivity. As our understanding of animal welfare evolves, zoos must prioritize the well-being and conservation of these incredible animals, supporting efforts to protect their natural habitats and prevent their extinction. Only then can we ensure that Zella's skill in peeling a banana is just one of many incredible behaviors we can observe and appreciate for generations to come.",1
221,Fox asks judge to bar references to January 6 attack at Dominion trial,"In a new twist to the ongoing trial of Dominion Voting Systems' defamation lawsuit, Fox News has asked a judge to bar any references to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol during the trial.

The embattled news network is seeking to exclude any mention of the insurrection as it believes it could prejudge the fairness of the trial, which centers around baseless claims aired on its network that Dominion rigged the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden.

In court filings on Monday, Fox argued that referencing the violent events of January 6th in Washington, DC could be used as a tactic by Dominion's legal team to unfairly evoke emotions and sway the jury.

Representatives of Fox News argued that the attack on the Capitol is too ""prejudicial, irrelevant"" to be brought up during the trial. The defense further stated that allowing the topic to be brought up would serve no other purpose than to try and paint Fox News as being connected to elements of the Republican party that might have a proclivity for violent action.

The filing was made in response to a motion that Dominion had put forward last week, which asked the court to allow them to detail any reports made by Fox News on the January 6th events in their opening statements. They claim these reports were designed to whip up anger and violence at the Capitol.

Dominion has accused Fox of acting maliciously to spread false claims about Dominion's voting machines and software long after the election was over – and with full knowledge that the claims had no foundation in truth.

As a result of these claims, Dominion alleges that they suffered damages to their reputation and finances – and have been forced to spend millions of dollars on public relations exercises to combat the false allegations aired on Fox News.

The case represents a significant legal threat for Fox News as it's one of a number of defamation lawsuits it is facing over its coverage of the 2020 election.

Despite the claims by Fox, there is no doubt that the events of January 6th cast a long shadow over this case. The storming of the U.S. Capitol was a defining moment in the country's history and is one that has sparked fierce debates about free speech, democratic norms, and the dangers of disinformation.

Given the huge amount of evidence of the link between the promotion of disinformation and the January 6th events, it's understandable that Dominion might want to draw a connection between the lies spread about their company by outlets such as Fox News and the wider issue of misinformation and propaganda driven in the weeks leading up to the events of January 6th.

However, the question now is whether the judge will agree to Fox's request and to restrict any mention of the insurrection throughout the trial. This is especially important given the political and social context in which this case is taking place.

Fox's argument that mention of the insurrection could taint the fairness of the trial at this stage is, undoubtedly, convincing. It's also important to note that the media outlet itself was one of the first to condemn the violence, while emphasizing that it didn't incite the crowd that broke into the Capitol.

However, there is also an argument that excluding the insurrection from this trial would be a mistake. The trial is centered around the idea that Fox acted irresponsibly and maliciously in promoting false allegations about Dominion voting machines, which could deprive it of the opportunity to explore this broader issue of misinformation and propaganda.

Moreover, by ignoring the connection between the election fraud allegations promoted by Fox News and the incitement of violence on January 6, we're missing an opportunity to have a fuller, more informed conversation about how these lies fosters what some analysts have called a 'post-truth' society.

Ultimately, this case is about holding the media accountable for spreading dangerous falsehoods – and restricting the wider context of January 6th could limit support for that larger goal. The judge in this case will need to balance the interests of the defendant (Fox News) and the plaintiff (Dominion Voting Systems) with the wider public interest.

This case, like others like it, will test the limits of what responsibility media outlets should take for the content they broadcast. It's a crucial and difficult question, and no matter where the trial goes, there's a real possibility that it will become one of the most significant legal battles of our time.",1

224,"Some Philips CPAP, BiPAP machines may not work as intended, FDA says in recall","Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a recall notice regarding certain Philips CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and BiPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) machines, as they may not function properly, putting patients at risk of serious health complications.

According to the FDA, the recalled devices could potentially cause injury or death due to the possible dislodging of foam from the devices, which could then be inhaled by the patient. This foam could also emit harmful chemicals and pollutants, which could be inhaled by the patient during use.

Philips has estimated that approximately three to four million devices are affected by the recall worldwide. The affected devices were manufactured between 2009 and 2021 and include both in-home and hospital units. The company has advised users to stop using the machines immediately and contact their healthcare provider to receive a replacement.

There have been reports of adverse reactions related to the affected devices, including headaches, irritation, coughing, chest pressure, and respiratory issues, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, allergies, or pulmonary fibrosis.

The FDA has urged patients and healthcare providers to review the recall notice carefully and take appropriate action. Patients should not stop using their machines without consulting their doctor as they are a vital therapy for treating sleep apnea and other respiratory-related issues.

Philips has stated that it is working closely with the FDA to address the issue and provide a resolution to customers as quickly as possible. The company has also set up a website, www.philips.com/src-update, to offer users information and support regarding the recall.

Sleep apnea is a common condition affecting millions of people worldwide, and CPAP and BiPAP machines are a common therapy for this condition. This recall is particularly concerning for patients who rely on these devices to maintain their quality of life.

In conclusion, the FDA's recall of certain Philips CPAP and BiPAP machines is a significant development in the medical world. Patients using these devices should not ignore the recall notice and take appropriate action, as this could significantly affect their health. Healthcare providers and the medical community, in general, must stay vigilant to ensure that patients receive safe and effective treatments for their medical conditions.",1
225,Screaming people and bodies everywhere: The horrific aftermath of Myanmar junta airstrike that killed 165,"Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military coup in February, and the situation continues to deteriorate with each passing day. The tragic consequences of the junta's actions were on full display on June 8th when a military airstrike hit a village in the eastern Shan state, killing at least 165 people, including children. The attack has left a community shattered, and many are now questioning how much longer the international community can stand by and watch as Myanmar plunges into chaos.

Eyewitness accounts from the scene paint a harrowing picture of destruction and loss. ""There were screaming people and bodies everywhere,"" one witness, who declined to be named for their safety, told CNN. ""We could see the flames from the village, and the sound of the planes was deafening.""

Another witness described the chaos that followed the bombing. ""There were people running around, trying to help those who were trapped under the rubble,"" they said. ""The smell of smoke and death was overwhelming.""

The airstrike has been condemned by the international community, with the United Nations calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities. ""We are appalled by the continued violence and atrocities committed by the military,"" said UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric in a statement. ""The targeting of civilians is unacceptable and must stop immediately.""

The Myanmar military has claimed that the airstrike targeted a base of ethnic armed groups, who have been fighting against the junta since the coup. However, eyewitnesses on the ground have disputed this claim, saying that the village was home to civilians who were not involved in the conflict.

""The military is lying to cover up their crimes,"" said Khin Maung, a representative of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy. ""They are deliberately targeting civilians and committing genocide.""

The junta's actions have been condemned by several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. ""We are deeply concerned by the escalating violence in Myanmar and condemn in the strongest terms the military's use of force against its own people,"" said a joint statement from the three countries.

Many are now calling on the international community to do more to help the people of Myanmar, who have been left vulnerable and traumatized by the ongoing violence. ""The people of Myanmar need our help now more than ever,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""We need to show them that they are not alone and that the world is watching.""

Some have suggested that the international community should take decisive action, such as imposing sanctions on the military junta or providing humanitarian aid to those in need. However, others have pointed out that these measures may not be enough to address the root causes of the conflict.

""What we need is a comprehensive, long-term solution that addresses the underlying issues that are fueling the conflict in Myanmar,"" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. ""This will require sustained diplomatic efforts and a commitment to human rights by all parties involved.""

Despite the challenges ahead, many remain hopeful that the people of Myanmar will eventually see the justice and freedom they deserve. ""We cannot give up hope,"" said one activist who wished to remain anonymous. ""We will continue fighting for our rights, and we will continue to demand that the world takes notice of what is happening in our country.""

As for the community in Shan state, they are left to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of the horrific airstrike. While the world watches and debates on how to respond, they are left to mourn their loved ones and try to rebuild their shattered lives.

""We cannot forget what happened here,"" said one villager. ""We will never forget the bloodshed and the violence. But we must also remember that we are a strong and resilient people, and we will not be defeated.""

The world must not turn a blind eye to the ongoing conflict in Myanmar. The international community has a responsibility to act and protect the innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. We cannot let this tragedy be forgotten or swept under the rug. The people of Myanmar deserve better, and we must do everything we can to help them.",1

228,What someone with an eating disorder wishes you knew,"As the world becomes more aware and accepting of different mental health issues, it’s important to understand the complexities of eating disorders. It’s not about a diet gone wrong, or a fad that’s taken over someone’s mind, but a serious condition with very deep roots. With so much misinformation and criticism surrounding this disorder, we spoke to someone who wishes to remain anonymous about what they wish people knew about living with an eating disorder.

Firstly, it’s crucial to understand that an eating disorder is not just about food, but rather about control. It’s less about wanting to look thin, and more about feeling completely out of control in all other aspects of life. “When I’m having a difficult time,” says our anonymous source, “it’s easier to take control by restricting my food intake or obsessing about what I’m eating, rather than dealing with the real issues at hand”. Comprehending this is vital to better grasp the intricate web that eating disorders can weave.

Moreover, the notion of control is also linked to a sense of safety. When life becomes overwhelming, turning to rituals or routines around eating can offer a sense of safety and stability. It’s about creating order in the midst of chaos, and that’s what our source says they found comfort in, even if it was counter-productive. “In a world that felt chaotic and filled with uncertainty, my rituals around food gave me something I could hold onto and rely on.”

To understand the psychological turmoil that comes with an eating disorder, it’s important to note that these challenges are not about vanity, but rather a deeply ingrained sense of inadequacy. It’s rooted in a constant longing for perfection - the perfect body, the perfect life, the perfect response. This never-ending pursuit of perfection is what drives those with eating disorders to extremes, regardless of how toxic and self-destructive it may be.

Our source explained that often, the constant strive for perfection is affiliated to feelings of low self-worth. Despite their many accomplishments, they always felt like they weren’t enough. It was only through therapy that they realized that self-worth does not come from external validation or achievements but from within. “It was hard to accept that my self-worth could exist independently of those accomplishments, but once I started to believe it, that’s when the healing began.”

The stigma around having an eating disorder often leads to a lack of inclusivity and understanding. Despite common misconceptions, individuals with eating disorders come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and genders. This is an issue encompassing a broad spectrum of people, and it's deep-rooted in our society. “I wish people understood that a person’s appearance does not determine whether they have an eating disorder or not,” our source said. “It’s much more complicated than that, and it's critical to look beyond surface-level perceptions.”

It’s also essential to note that eating disorders are not synonymous with Anorexia. While that may be the most recognizable form, there are several others, including Bulimia and Binge Eating disorder. Understanding the differences between each of these illnesses is vital when dealing with them.

It’s also well-known that mental disorders often intensify with the holidays. The constant stream of food, socializing, and togetherness could be overwhelming, particularly for someone already struggling with an eating disorder. This is where compassion and sensitivity become crucial. Holidays are incredibly difficult for everyone, but particularly so for someone with an eating disorder. Kindness, empathy, and understanding will go a long way.

Furthermore, the portrayal of eating disorders within the media is often troubling. Shows like ""The Biggest Loser"" and ""Extreme Weight Loss"" tend to reduce the issue to a simple lack of willpower. It’s precisely the opposite. People who struggle with eating disorders often face enormous emotional and mental stress, and it can be challenging to overcome. It's crucial to understand that these shows, although presented as motivations or inspirations, can often do more harm than good to those already struggling with their body image or weight.

While it may take a considerable amount of therapy and self-love to overcome disordered thoughts and patterns, our source says that it is possible. They credit their recovery to therapy, medication, and their support system, which included family members and friends.

Inclusivity, empathy, and compassion are what people struggling with an eating disorder need the most. The ability to discuss it without feeling ashamed or judged is a critical component of recovery. For many battling this affliction, the road to recovery is long and arduous, but shedding light on the issue will go a long way towards fostering compassion, empathy, and understanding.",1
229,How electric tuk-tuks could become a 'virtual power plant' for this country,"As the world continues its shift towards renewable energy sources, one country in particular is looking to use an unlikely source to power its grid - electric tuk-tuks.

Thailand, with its bustling streets and heavy traffic, is home to an estimated 20,000 tuk-tuks - the iconic three-wheeled taxis that are a popular mode of transportation in the country's cities. While these small vehicles might not seem like a significant power source, a novel project is looking to harness their potential as a ""virtual power plant"".

The project, led by the government's Energy Absolute PLC, aims to convert tuk-tuks to electric power and connect them to the country's electricity grid. With a 3-kilowatt-hour battery on each vehicle, the fleet of electric tuk-tuks could provide up to 60 megawatts of power - enough to power 40,000 households.

The idea is to create a ""virtual power plant"" that can help stabilize the grid and reduce the need for fossil-fuel power plants that would otherwise be needed to meet peak demand. By aggregating the power from thousands of small energy sources, the project could also help to smooth out fluctuations in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

But the project has faced some challenges. One of the key obstacles has been the cost of converting tuk-tuks to electric power. While the conversion can cost up to $2,500 per vehicle, the government is offering subsidies to encourage drivers to make the switch.

Another issue has been the lack of charging infrastructure for the electric tuk-tuks. Energy Absolute is currently working on establishing a network of charging stations that can support the fleet of vehicles.

Despite the challenges, the project has garnered attention as an innovative way to integrate electric vehicles into the grid. In addition to the tuk-tuk project, Thailand has set a goal of having 1.2 million electric cars on its roads by 2036.

The move towards cleaner energy sources is part of a broader shift in Southeast Asia towards renewable energy. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, the region's installed renewable energy capacity has increased by 50% since 2014.

Thailand has been a leader in this shift, with the government implementing policies to encourage the development of renewable energy sources. The country has set a target of generating 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2036, up from just 10% in 2021.

The shift towards renewable energy has the potential to create jobs and boost economic growth, as well as improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the transition to renewable energy is not without its challenges. While the cost of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power has dropped significantly in recent years, there are still limitations to how much energy they can generate at any given time. This variability can make it difficult to maintain a stable grid, especially during peak demand periods.

Projects like the electric tuk-tuk virtual power plant are one way of addressing this issue, by aggregating the energy from thousands of small sources to create a more stable and predictable energy supply.

The project has the potential to be replicated in other countries with large fleets of tuk-tuks, such as India and the Philippines, as well as in other sectors that rely on small, mobile energy sources.

The integration of electric vehicles into the grid has other benefits as well. By using renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles, carbon emissions can be significantly reduced compared to traditional fossil-fuel vehicles.

In addition, electric vehicles can help to improve air quality in cities, which is a major issue in many developing countries. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million premature deaths per year, with most of the deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

The shift towards electric vehicles could help to address this issue, as they produce no tailpipe emissions and generate less air pollution than traditional vehicles.

The electric tuk-tuk project is just one example of the many innovative solutions that are emerging in the global shift towards renewable energy. While there are still many challenges to be addressed, the project is a promising example of how small-scale energy sources can be harnessed to create a more sustainable and reliable energy system.

As Thailand continues its transition towards renewable energy, projects like the electric tuk-tuk virtual power plant could play an important role in helping to meet the country's energy needs while reducing its carbon footprint.",1
230,US health officials aim to 'transform' Alzheimer's disease research with $300 million data platform,"US health officials have announced plans to 'transform' Alzheimer's disease research with a $300 million data platform. The new initiative, called the Accelerating Medicines Partnership- Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation Project, will aim to accelerate the discovery of new treatments and therapies for the debilitating condition.

According to the Alzheimer's Association, more than 6 million Americans are currently living with the disease, with costs estimated to exceed $355 billion in 2021. Despite decades of research, there are still no effective treatments to slow or stop the progression of Alzheimer's.

The new data platform, which will be funded by the National Institutes of Health and co-led by the National Institute on Aging and the Foundation for the NIH, will bring together data from clinical, genetic, molecular, and imaging studies in a standardized and accessible format. This will allow researchers to more easily identify potential targets for new treatments and to share data and research findings with each other.

Speaking about the new initiative, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said: ""The AMP-AD Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation Project has the potential to transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease research. By bringing together the best scientific minds and extensive data resources, we hope to accelerate the discovery of new treatments and therapies that will ultimately improve the lives of those affected by this devastating disease.""

The new platform will build on the work of the AMP-AD Target Discovery Consortium, which was launched in 2014 to identify new targets for Alzheimer's treatments. The consortium has already made significant progress in identifying potential new drug targets, including two new genes that may play a role in Alzheimer's disease.

The new initiative will also offer funding opportunities for researchers to study the newly identified targets in preclinical models, with the ultimate goal of moving promising therapies into clinical trials.

The AMP-AD initiative is just one of several new investments in Alzheimer's research by the US government. Earlier this year, Congress approved a $425 million increase in funding for Alzheimer's and dementia research as part of the FY2021 budget.

Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, US health officials remain committed to accelerating progress in Alzheimer's research. With the new AMP-AD platform and other initiatives, researchers and advocates hope to finally make significant strides in understanding and treating this devastating disease.",1
231,Mortgage rates drop for fifth week in a row,"In a boost for homebuyers and those looking to refinance, mortgage rates continued to fall for a fifth consecutive week.

The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 2.78% this week, down from 2.87% last week, according to Freddie Mac’s weekly survey of lenders. That’s the lowest level since mid-February and nearly a full percentage point lower than where rates stood a year ago. 

The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage also decreased to 2.12%, from 2.17% the previous week, while the 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage moved down to 2.49% from 2.58%.

The continued decline in rates is a clear indication that the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates near zero is having an impact on the mortgage market. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainty around the economy and the COVID-19 pandemic has put downward pressure on rates.

“Mortgage rates have remained low because of the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep rates low in order to support the economy, and continued uncertainty over the pandemic,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “At the same time, job growth has been strong, housing demand is outstripping supply, and the economy is reopening. That combination is a recipe for more homebuying activity and higher home prices.”

The low rates have certainly spurred home buying activity. According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of previously owned homes increased for the third consecutive month in June, as low mortgage rates and job growth spurred demand for homes. Meanwhile, purchases of new homes also rose to the highest level in over 13 years in June.

Refinancing has also been a popular option for those looking to take advantage of the low rates. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinancing activity increased by 5% last week, although it is still down 47% from a year ago.

But just how long will these low rates last? While there is no crystal ball, most experts agree that rates will likely stay low for the foreseeable future, particularly if the Federal Reserve continues its accommodative monetary policy.

“Rates will likely stay low for some time, particularly if the Fed keeps its policy supportive,” said McBride. “But the Fed can’t keep rates low forever, and we’ll eventually see rate hikes once the economy is fully back on track.”

That being said, not everyone is taking advantage of the low rates. Many homeowners, particularly those who have been hit hard by the pandemic, are struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and may be facing foreclosure.

To address this issue, the federal government has implemented a number of programs to help struggling homeowners. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, for example, allows borrowers with federally-backed mortgages to request forbearance, which allows them to pause mortgage payments for up to 180 days, with the possibility of an extension for another 180 days.

In addition, many states and cities have implemented their own programs to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. For example, the City of Los Angeles has implemented a program that provides up to $10,000 in mortgage assistance to eligible homeowners who have been impacted by the pandemic.

Despite the challenges facing some homeowners, however, the continued decline in mortgage rates is good news for those looking to buy a home or refinance. With rates at historic lows, now may be a good time to consider taking advantage of the favorable market conditions.

As rates continue to fluctuate, it’s important for anyone considering buying or refinancing to do their research and work with a qualified lender to find the best rates and terms. With careful planning and preparation, homeownership can be a smart investment in any economic environment.",1

235,Chronic stress can affect your health. One activity can help,"Chronic stress can affect your health. One activity can help

Stress is a normal part of life and can sometimes be helpful. A healthy level of stress can motivate us to take action and tackle challenges. However, when stress becomes chronic, it can have a negative impact on our health.

Chronic stress is when the body experiences a prolonged state of stress, which can lead to physical and emotional exhaustion. If left untreated, chronic stress can lead to a range of health problems, including heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

The good news is that there are simple activities you can do to reduce stress and improve your overall health. One such activity that has been shown to have a positive impact on stress is yoga.

Yoga is a mind-body practice that involves physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation. The practice originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and has become increasingly popular in Western countries in recent years.

Research has shown that practicing yoga can reduce the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. In one study, individuals who participated in a 12-week yoga program saw a significant reduction in stress levels compared to those who did not practice yoga.

There are several ways that yoga can help reduce stress. First and foremost, the physical postures, or asanas, are designed to release tension and improve flexibility. Yoga postures stretch the muscles, increase blood flow, and stimulate the nervous system, helping to reduce physical tension and promote relaxation.

In addition to the physical postures, yoga also involves breathing exercises, or pranayama. Breathing exercises are used to calm the mind and reduce stress. Slow, deep breathing can have a calming effect on the body, reducing the production of stress hormones and increasing feelings of relaxation.

Another aspect of yoga that can help reduce stress is meditation. Meditation involves sitting still and focusing the mind on a single point, such as the breath. This practice has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve overall well-being.

While yoga is a great way to reduce stress, it is important to choose the right type of yoga class for your needs. Some types of yoga, such as power yoga, can be more physically demanding and may not be suitable for individuals who are dealing with chronic stress.

Restorative yoga and gentle yoga are better suited for individuals who are dealing with chronic stress or other health problems. These types of yoga focus on gentle stretching, deep breathing, and relaxation, which can help reduce stress levels and promote overall well-being.

In addition to practicing yoga, there are other simple activities you can do to reduce stress and improve your health. Here are some tips:

1. Exercise regularly – Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosting chemicals. Regular exercise can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve overall physical health.

2. Practice mindfulness – Mindfulness involves being present in the moment and focusing on the present experience, rather than worrying about the past or future. Mindfulness has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve overall well-being.

3. Get enough sleep – Chronic stress can disrupt sleep, which can further exacerbate stress levels. Getting enough sleep can help reduce stress and improve overall health.

4. Eat a healthy diet – Eating a balanced and healthy diet can help reduce stress levels and improve overall physical health. Avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks, and alcohol can also help reduce stress levels.

5. Connect with others – Connecting with family and friends can provide emotional support and help reduce stress levels. Joining a support group or volunteering can also provide a sense of community and purpose.

In conclusion, chronic stress can have a negative impact on our health, but there are simple activities we can do to reduce stress and improve our overall well-being. Yoga is one such activity that has been shown to reduce stress levels and improve physical and emotional health. By incorporating yoga and other stress-reducing practices into our daily routine, we can improve our quality of life and reduce the negative impact of chronic stress.",1

237,FDA approves first over-the-counter version of opioid overdose antidote Narcan,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first over-the-counter (OTC) version of Narcan, the opioid overdose antidote. The move is aimed at improving access to the life-saving medication and reducing fatalities from opioid overdoses.

Narcan, also known as naloxone, is an opioid antagonist that rapidly reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. The medication is injected or administered as a nasal spray and works by binding to the same receptors in the brain as opioids, blocking their effects and restoring breathing.

Until recently, Narcan was only available through prescription or by emergency responders, limiting its widespread use and increasing the risk of fatalities from opioid overdoses. But in recent years, efforts have been made to make Narcan more widely accessible, including through state-level OTC programs and the distribution of free Narcan kits in communities affected by the opioid epidemic.

Now, with the FDA's approval of an OTC version of Narcan, the medication will be available without a prescription at pharmacies across the country. The move is expected to increase access to the medication and potentially save thousands of lives.

""The approval of an over-the-counter version of Narcan is a significant step forward in our efforts to combat the opioid epidemic,"" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb in a statement. ""By providing this life-saving medication without a prescription, we hope to put it in the hands of more people who are at risk of opioid overdose.""

The OTC version of Narcan will be available as a nasal spray and will come with instructions for use. The medication will be sold under the brand name Evzio and will be distributed by Adapt Pharma, a company that specializes in opioid overdose prevention.

In a press release, Adapt Pharma CEO Seamus Mulligan said the company was ""committed to increasing access to naloxone as part of our mission to save lives."" He added that the OTC version of Narcan ""will empower more people to take action and help prevent opioid overdose deaths.""

The approval of an OTC version of Narcan has been widely welcomed by experts and advocates working to address the opioid epidemic. The move is seen as a necessary step to increase access to the medication and reduce fatalities from opioid overdoses.

""The availability of an over-the-counter version of naloxone is a critical next step in our collective efforts to prevent opioid overdose deaths in this country,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, the health commissioner for Baltimore City, which has been at the forefront of efforts to expand access to Narcan.

""We know that there are many people who are at risk of overdose but may not have ready access to naloxone,"" Dr. Wen added. ""By making it available over the counter, we can ensure that more individuals have this life-saving medication on hand.""

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, over 130 people die every day from opioid overdoses in the US. The opioid epidemic has had devastating effects on communities across the country, leading to increased rates of addiction, overdose, and death.

Efforts to address the epidemic have included increased funding for addiction treatment and recovery programs, as well as expanded access to Narcan and other overdose prevention measures.

The approval of an OTC version of Narcan is a welcome addition to these efforts, as it will help make the medication more widely accessible and reduce barriers to its use. However, experts caution that the availability of Narcan alone will not be enough to address the opioid epidemic.

""We need a comprehensive approach to addressing the opioid epidemic that includes prevention, treatment, and recovery,"" said Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, a professor of the practice of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

""Narcan is an important tool in our arsenal, but it's not a silver bullet,"" Dr. Sharfstein added. ""We need to address the root causes of the epidemic, including the over-prescription of opioids and the lack of access to addiction treatment.""

Despite these challenges, the approval of an OTC version of Narcan is a major step forward in the fight against the opioid epidemic. By increasing access to this life-saving medication, we can help prevent untold numbers of tragedies and save countless lives.",1
238,"Whether you're a 'shark,' 'teddy bear' or 'fox,' here's how to ease conflict with family and friends","Conflict is a normal aspect of human relationships. As much as we’d like to avoid it, conflict is an inevitable part of life. Especially when it comes to family and friends, where emotions run strong, disagreements can quickly escalate into full-blown arguments.

It can be challenging to manage these situations, but the good news is that there are certain approaches that can help ease conflict with family and friends. By understanding your own communication style and that of others, you can develop strategies to resolve conflicts in a way that minimizes emotional turmoil.

Experts have identified three kinds of communication styles that people tend to adopt in conflict situations. These are ‘sharks,’ ‘teddy bears,’ and ‘foxes.’

Sharks are assertive communicators who tend to be loud, aggressive, and often intimidating. They take charge of the conversation, and their aim is to win at all costs. It's their way or the highway.

Teddy bears, on the other hand, are conflict-avoidant. They tend to people-please and avoid direct confrontation. They may agree with others just to keep the peace, even if they disagree internally.

Foxes adopt a more collaborative approach. They are empathetic listeners who seek to understand others' perspectives while also advocating their own. They negotiate and look for mutually-beneficial solutions.

Knowing your communication style can help you understand how you react in conflict situations and develop a strategy to resolve conflicts. It's also essential to know the communication style of the person you're engaging with, as it will help you tailor your approach to the situation better.

If you're dealing with a 'shark,' adopt a more assertive approach. Be clear and concise in your communication, use ""I"" statements to express how you feel and what you want, and avoid playing the blame game. Keep your cool and don’t take their aggressive behavior personally. Stay focused on resolving the issue at hand.

If you're more of a ""teddy bear,"" you might need to step out of your comfort zone and adopt a more assertive approach. Speak up and share your thoughts and feelings honestly, without being confrontational or provocative. Remember, it’s okay to disagree. What matters is how you handle the disagreement.

If you're dealing with a 'fox,' you're in luck. Foxes are collaborative communicators who seek to understand everyone's perspectives. Adopt a collaborative approach, listen to their point of view, and look for mutually-beneficial solutions. Avoid taking an oppositional stance, and instead, focus on your shared interests.

Once you have a handle on the communication styles involved, there are several strategies you can use to ease conflict in your relationships.

First, focus on your emotions. It's important to take a step back and examine your feelings when you're experiencing conflict. Are you angry, frustrated, sad, or anxious? Once you understand your emotions, work on expressing them calmly and clearly.

Communicate openly and honestly. Be transparent about your thoughts and feelings, and make sure to listen actively to the other person's perspective. When we listen, we learn more about the other person's needs and desires, which can help us find common ground.

Practice active listening. Active listening means giving your complete attention to the other person and responding with empathy. Repeat what they've said back to them to make sure you understand their point of view correctly.

Be solution-oriented. Instead of focusing on the problem, focus on finding solutions. Ask for suggestions and be open to all possibilities. When both parties work together to find a solution, the outcome is more likely to be mutually beneficial.

Make peace with your past. Sometimes conflicts arise due to unresolved issues from the past. If this is the case, take time to reflect on the patterns in your relationships and examine how you might have contributed to those patterns. Forgiveness and empathy can go a long way in healing old wounds.

Finally, don’t be afraid to seek outside help if necessary. Professional counseling can help couples and families work through conflicts and improve communication. This can be particularly helpful if conflicts are deeply entrenched or if there is a history of trauma or abuse.

In conclusion, conflict is an inevitable part of relationships, but it doesn't have to destroy them. By understanding your communication style and that of others, as well as using strategies to ease conflict, you can work through disagreements in a way that strengthens relationships and creates mutual understanding. With patience, empathy, and a willingness to compromise, you can build stronger, more rewarding connections with the people you love.",1
239,"He's a rookie, just 10 days out of the police academy. Now, he's fighting for his life after rushing in to stop the Louisville bank mass shooter","A young rookie police officer is fighting for his life after risking his own safety to stop a mass shooter at a Louisville bank. Just 10 days out of the police academy, Officer Michael Riley leapt into action when he heard gunfire at the First Savings Bank.

Riley's quick thinking and bravery have been praised by law enforcement officials and members of the community alike. But his actions also serve as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by law enforcement officers every day.

The shooting took place on a busy weekday morning, with customers and employees inside the bank conducting their daily business. The gunman, later identified as Mark Lee, entered the bank and began firing indiscriminately, hitting several people.

Riley was the first officer to respond to the scene. Without hesitation, he charged into the bank to confront the shooter, unaware of the number of people inside or the firepower of the shooter.

In the midst of the chaos, Riley exchanged gunfire with Lee, giving other officers time to arrive and subdue the shooter. Unfortunately, Riley was hit in the head during the melee and is now fighting for his life.

The tragedy has shaken the Louisville community, with residents expressing their gratitude and support for the young officer. A vigil was held for him outside the hospital where he is being treated, with hundreds of people showing up to pray for his recovery.

Louisville Mayor, Greg Fischer, said in a statement: ""We are grateful and proud of Officer Riley for his courage and swift response to this terrible situation. We are praying for his full recovery, and for the families and friends of those affected by this senseless act of violence.""

The shooting at the First Savings Bank is just the latest in a string of violent incidents that have rocked the country in recent years. Shootings at schools, churches, and public spaces have reminded us that we live in an increasingly dangerous world.

Law enforcement officers are on the front lines of these events, tasked with protecting their communities and ensuring the safety of citizens. But the dangers they face are immense and at times, overwhelming.

According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there were 264 law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in 2020. This number is a stark reminder of the risks faced by those who serve and protect our communities.

Officer Riley's story is a testament to the bravery and courage of the men and women of law enforcement. Despite knowing the inherent dangers of their job, they rush towards danger to help others, often at great personal risk.

It is important that we recognize the sacrifices made by law enforcement officers, who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe. As a community, we must come together to support and honor those who serve, whether they are just out of the police academy or seasoned veterans with years of experience.

In the wake of Officer Riley's heroism, the Louisville Police Department has vowed to continue their commitment to serving and protecting the community. In a statement, they said: ""We stand with Officer Riley and his family during this difficult time. We will continue to serve our community with honor and dedication, knowing that the safety and security of our citizens is our highest priority.""

Officer Michael Riley's bravery and selflessness will not be forgotten. His actions serve as an inspiration to us all and a reminder of the sacrifices made by law enforcement officers every day.",1

244,Juul settles lawsuit with West Virginia for $7.9 million,"In a major development, e-cigarette giant Juul has agreed to settle a lawsuit with West Virginia for $7.9 million. This settlement comes as a surprise since Juul had been reluctant to settle any of the numerous lawsuits it faces across the country.

The lawsuit, filed by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in 2019, alleged that Juul had engaged in deceptive marketing practices that targeted youth. Specifically, the lawsuit claimed that Juul used attractive flavors and flashy marketing to lure young people into using e-cigarettes, causing a public health crisis.

Juul, which has been under scrutiny for its role in the rise of youth e-cigarette use, has faced numerous lawsuits from states, cities, and individuals. The company has denied any wrongdoing but has been accused of marketing its products in a way that appeals to young people, leading to a surge in e-cigarette use among teenagers.

Under the terms of the settlement, Juul will pay West Virginia $7.9 million over the next five years, with the funds being used to support education and addiction treatment programs. In addition, Juul has agreed to modify its marketing practices in the state, including limiting the sale of flavored e-cigarettes to adult-only stores and ending its sale of online products to West Virginia residents.

In a statement, Attorney General Morrisey praised the settlement as a significant victory for public health. ""This settlement holds Juul accountable for its role in fueling the youth e-cigarette epidemic and helps fund programs that will help young people quit smoking and prevent future generations from becoming addicted,"" he said.

While the settlement is a positive development, it is unlikely to be the last legal challenge Juul faces. The company still faces numerous lawsuits from states and cities across the country, including a landmark lawsuit in California that seeks to hold Juul responsible for the millions of dollars spent on treating vaping-related illnesses.

It remains to be seen whether other states will follow West Virginia's lead in settling with Juul. Some states, such as Massachusetts, have taken a more aggressive approach, filing lawsuits against Juul executives and accusing the company of intentionally targeting youth.

Regardless of the legal outcomes, the rise of youth e-cigarette use remains a pressing public health concern. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, e-cigarette use among young people has risen sharply in recent years, with one in five high school students reporting e-cigarette use in 2020.

Given the enormous toll that smoking takes on public health, it is essential that companies like Juul are held accountable for their role in fueling the youth e-cigarette epidemic. While the $7.9 million settlement with West Virginia is only a small fraction of Juul's massive revenues, it represents an important step forward in addressing a major public health crisis.",1
245,Memphis sends Justin J. Pearson back to the Tennessee House days after GOP lawmakers ousted him,"In a surprising turn of events, Justin J. Pearson, a Republican member of Tennessee House District 47, has been reinstated to his previous position. Pearson was expelled from the Tennessee General Assembly last week by the GOP, citing 'irreconcilable differences.' However, following much debate and discussion, the party issued an apology to Pearson and announced that he would be reinstated to his position in the House.

Pearson's troubles began late last year when he was discovered to have exchanged offensive and misogynistic text messages with a young intern. The texts were discovered during an internal investigation by the Tennessee Republican Party, and Pearson was immediately removed from his position. The party cited that Pearson's behavior violated their values and principles and warranted expulsion.

However, Pearson vehemently denied any wrongdoing and accused party leadership of targeting him for his conservative beliefs. He said that he was being 'persecuted' for holding a different opinion and that the messages were being 'misinterpreted.' Pearson refused to resign and challenged his expulsion, launching a legal battle with the Tennessee GOP.

The controversy surrounding Pearson's expulsion has divided the Tennessee Republican Party, with some members supporting him and others wanting him to be removed permanently. However, after days of tense negotiations, the party has decided to reinstate Pearson, citing his contrition and willingness to change.

In a statement released to the media, the Tennessee GOP said, ""We apologize to Justin J. Pearson and his family for any harm caused to him by our hasty decision. We acknowledge that Mr. Pearson has shown remorse and a willingness to reform. We believe that everyone deserves a second chance, and we hope that Mr. Pearson will use this opportunity to make amends and guide his future actions in a constructive and positive manner.""

The statement further added that the party would be working with Pearson to ensure that he is properly trained and educated regarding the party's values and principles. The party also called for unity among its members, urging them to put aside their differences and work together for the betterment of Tennessee.

The news of Pearson's reinstatement has been met with mixed reactions. Many of his supporters are ecstatic and are hailing the decision as a victory for freedom of speech and conservative values. Others, however, are outraged and are accusing the party of caving under pressure and compromising their principles.

Pearson himself has not yet made any public statements about his reinstatement. However, his wife, Jennifer Pearson, expressed her relief and gratitude in a Facebook post, saying, ""We are overjoyed that the truth has finally come out, and Justin is being given a chance to prove himself. We appreciate all the support and prayers that we have received during this difficult time and are looking forward to moving on and making a positive impact in our community.""

Pearson's reinstatement also raises questions regarding the future of the Republican Party in Tennessee. The party has been grappling with internal divisions and accusations of infighting for months, leading many to wonder whether they can still present a united front in next year's elections.

Some political analysts believe that Pearson's reinstatement could help heal the rifts within the party, as it shows that they are willing to forgive and move past their differences. Others, however, are skeptical and believe that the damage has already been done, and the party will struggle to regain the trust and support of its constituents.

Whatever the outcome, one thing is clear – the Tennessee Republican Party is at a critical juncture in its history. They must navigate the treacherous waters of internal divisions, accusations of wrongdoing, and a rapidly changing political landscape. Only time will tell whether they can rise to the challenge and emerge stronger and more united than ever before.

For now, however, the reinstatement of Justin J. Pearson marks a significant moment in the party's history. It shows that they are willing to learn from their mistakes and acknowledge their shortcomings, which could be a turning point in their efforts to rebuild and unite the party.

As Pearson returns to his position in the Tennessee House, he will undoubtedly face a barrage of questions and scrutiny from the media and his constituents. However, he has been given a unique opportunity to prove himself and make a positive impact in his district. It remains to be seen whether he will seize this opportunity and rise to the occasion.",1

250,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color,"When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, ""we're already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we're going to get hit harder."" Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America's 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. ""When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,"" said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.  Many women and people of color say they are turned away  Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.  In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. ""We know there's historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that's inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,"" Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB's collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don't have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn't recognize them. ""The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, 'Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,'"" Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the ""top four banks"" — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the ""top four banks"" when her brother co-signed for her.  ""The top four don't want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that's why we've gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,"" Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN's Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank's recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. SVB's collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says   Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. ""I said, 'Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,' because I am all three,"" Hamilton told CNN.  Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an 'angel investor' of minority-owned businesses, said she remains ""really hopeful"" that community banks, regional banks and fintechs ""will all stand up and say, 'Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.'""",0

252,Behold the stuffed-crust bagel,"In the 1990s, Pizza Hut unveiled an important cheese-in-bread innovation, the stuffed crust pizza. Now, Philadelphia cream cheese and H&H Bagels, a New York City-based bagel shop, are trying to please the carbohydrate- and dairy-loving communities with a new and dubious spin on the stuffed crust: The bagel stuffed with cream cheese.  But unlike stuffed-crust pizzas, the bagel is filled with cheese after it is baked, making it more of a cream cheese bagel donut, if not in spirit then at least in form.  The bagels are ""baked fresh daily and then cooled to be individually stuffed with Philly's signature cream cheese one at a time,"" according to Jay Rushin, CEO of  H&H. ""H&H Bagels use a pastry tool to pipe in the Philly cream cheese by hand,"" he added. ""The process leaves very small holes where the insertions are made, similar to a jelly donut.""  The obvious question, as is often the case with food mash-ups, is why. What's so wrong with slicing a bagel and slathering on a healthy amount of cream cheese? Why must we pre-cheese the bagel? Because, Philly owner Kraft Heinz and H&H say, the simple acts of cutting and spreading are taxed, at least in New York.   ""New York City may be the bagel capital of the world, but its residents incur a ludicrous 'bagel tax' each time they opt to purchase a bagel that's sliced and schmeared with cream cheese,"" the companies said in a release.  That's true, sort of. New York doesn't have a specific bagel tax, explained Ryan Cleveland, a representative of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. But certain food products, including baked goods, are tax exempt, while prepared foods are not.  ""It's when a bagel becomes a sandwich or a prepared food that it then becomes taxable,"" he said. In New York City, food sold at restaurants is taxed at 8.875%. Philadelphia and H&H plan to skirt this rule with the stuffed bagel, which is available at H&H's Manhattan locations for $1.90 each, from Friday through Tax Day on Tuesday, April 18; and also online. ""In today's landscape, people are juggling enough hurdles, and having to pay an extra tax to enjoy their favorite bagel with Philly cream cheese should simply not be one of them,"" said Keenan White, senior brand manager of Philadelphia cream cheese, in a statement.  White and Kraft Heinz may well care about their customers' tax payments. But for food companies, marketing stunts are about creating buzz and staying at the forefront of customers' minds when they visit the supermarket — or bagel shop.  Kraft in particular has in recent years been leaning into questionable combinations, like the Velveeta Martini and a hot dog flavored popsicle, to promote its brands and get attention.  Philadelphia cream cheese, which struggled with shortages in the past, turned that issue into a marketing opportunity as well. There's no problem with supply now, according to the brand.",0

254,Deal close for Washington Commanders football team,"A group that is led by Wall Street billionaire Josh Harris and includes NBA legend Magic Johnson is nearing a deal to buy the NFL's Washington Commanders, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN. If finalized, the sale would mark the end of the controversial ownership of the Washington franchise by embattled billionaire Daniel Snyder. The group also includes Mitchell Rales, the billionaire co-founder of conglomerate Danaher, the source said. The NFL, the Commanders, and Harris's office would not comment on the matter. News of the near deal was first reported by Sportico, which reported the team sold for $6 billion, a record for a North American sports franchise. The current record of $4.65 billion for the purchase of the NFL's Denver Broncos was set just last year. Snyder purchased the team, then named the Washington Redskins for a reported $750 million in 1999. The team dropped its previous name in 2020 in the face of prolonged criticism. It adopted the Commanders name last year, after playing two seasons with the name Washington Football Team. Forbes had previously estimated the value of the Commanders at $5.6 billion, making it the sixth most valuable football team, after the Dallas Cowboys, the New England Patriots, the Los Angeles Rams, the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears. The only franchises from other sports worth more than that $5.6 billion estimated value are the New York Yankees and New York Knicks.  The reported rise in value for the team to $6 billion would represent about a 9% annual return on the original purchase price. Harris, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, already owns the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and co-owns the NHL's New Jersey Devils. The Harris-led group officially placed a bid on the Commanders in late March, CNN previously reported. Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers superstar, joined the group last month. Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos placed a separate $6 billion bid to buy the Commanders last month as well, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Snyder said last year that he is considering a sale of the team. At the time, Snyder and his wife, Tanya, announced that they hired Bank of America Securities ""to consider potential transactions."" The decision to seek a buyer came after DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced a lawsuit against Snyder, the team and the NFL, alleging they colluded to deceive DC residents about an NFL investigation into the team's toxic workplace culture and allegations of sexual assault. The lawsuit alleges those deceptive efforts aimed to keep fans in the dark and increase profits for the team. The lawsuit cites the District of Columbia's Consumer Protection Procedures Act, which gives the Attorney General broad authority to hold individuals or a company accountable for misleading customers. Racine subsequently filed another suit for allegedly cheating ticket holders out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The complaint alleges that Pro Football Inc., the Snyder-led official owner of the Commanders, implemented a ""decades-long unlawful scheme"" to withhold hundreds of thousands of dollars in security deposits fans paid for season tickets and ""converted that money into revenue for the Team, to use for its own purposes."" In June of 2022, the House Oversight Committee also accused Snyder of fostering a ""toxic workplace"" and conducting ""a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL's own internal review."" And an internal investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson in 2021 resulted in the NFL fining the Commanders $10 million and Snyder handing control of the franchise's daily operations to his wife. Snyder has denied the allegations. News of a possible sale was cheered by some of Snyder's accusers Thursday. ""Today marks the end of a long, difficult chapter for all employees and fans of the Washington football organization,"" read a statement from Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, two attorneys representing more than 40 former Washington Commanders employees. ""We are proud of our many clients who made this moment possible -- the brave women and men who came forward repeatedly and at great personal risk to expose the decades of sexual harassment and financial wrongdoing at the team.  Their determination and perseverance forced this sale to happen.""   ""We want to welcome the new owners and hope a new chapter can truly begin at the organization. We expect that the NFL now understands that such an abusive workplace for women is unacceptable,"" the statement continued. ""The NFL must be more vigilant and must ensure that owners are held to the same standards as all employers; sexual harassment is illegal and must not be tolerated."" -- CNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report",0
255,French protesters storm headquarters of luxury giant LVMH,"Hundreds of thousands of people took part in a fresh round of demonstrations across France on Thursday over government plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, a day before a crucial court ruling on the constitutionality of the divisive law. Protesters in Paris forced their way into the headquarters of luxury giant LVMH, on the day shares in the company -- which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton and Moët -- jumped to a record high.   ""If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,"" Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the LVMH building.   Multiple flare ups have taken place throughout the day. Police halted a protest in front of the Constitutional Council, France's equivalent of the US supreme court, which will hand down a long-awaited ruling on the validity of the pension reform law on Friday. A ban on protests in the area is in place from Thursday evening until Saturday morning local time.  CNN teams on the ground witnessed protesters engaging in intense scuffles with police as smoke bombs, projectiles and tear gas were fired, before a group set off red flares outside the court building. Violence also broke out at Paris' Place de la Bastille as riot police clashed with angry protestors. ""At least a thousand radical individuals present at the forefront of the demonstration area tried on several occasions to commit acts of violence along the route and to hinder the smooth progress of the demonstration,"" a spokesman for the Paris police said. The police were also seen protecting the BHV department store by charging at protesters in the Rue de Rivoli in central Paris. Around 380,000 people attended the protests across France on Thursday, 42,000 of whom were in Paris, according to the latest figures from the French interior ministry.  The figure is down from last week's 11th round of demonstrations which drew in crowds of approximately 570,000. Police had been expecting further violent attacks that have been a visible, if minor, feature of the protests across France over the past two and a half months, with particular attention on so-called ""black bloc"" protesters, part of a radical fringe that has been present from the start of the country's social upheaval. Macron pushing reform France's President Emmanuel Macron argues reforms are essential to rein in public finances, and has been standing firm, this week saying ""the country must continue to move forward."" Speaking at an incinerator picket line near Paris on Thursday morning, Sophie Binet, the new head of the GGT, one of France's main unions, insisted: ""As long as the pension reform is not withdrawn, the mobilization will continue one way or another."" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo voiced her support for the demonstrators before the new round of protests. ""On the eve of the decision of the constitutional council, I am once again supporting the mobilisations in Paris and everywhere in France,"" Hidalgo tweeted. ""This reform is unjust and violent. The French have been asking for it to be withdrawn for months, the government has to hear them,"" she wrote. Friday's ruling will be decisive on whether the protests will continue. The CFDT, France's other main union, has been more amenable to a negotiated settlement. Garbage is meanwhile also set to fill the streets of Paris once more as collectors and incinerator workers are on strike again, according to the CGT union.  This will be a rolling strike, the general secretary of the CGT union branch confirmed in a letter to the Paris mayor.  The previous near month-long strike, up until the end of March, had seen 10,000 tonnes of rubbish piled up across the capital at its worst.",0

257,Louisville mass shooting victim had just moved to city two weeks earlier for new bank job,"The daughter of Juliana Farmer, one of the five victims of the mass shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, said Wednesday night her mother had just moved to Louisville two weeks prior for a new job.  ""This monster took away my mother, and I'm hurt because my mother moved here to help me, a single mom with four kids. I only got two weeks with her here in Louisville ... a city she knew nothing about,"" Alia Chambers told CNN. ""I'm heartbroken. I hated him. I hated him but I forgive him because my mama is in a better place."" Farmer moved to Louisville from Henderson, Kentucky, and was thrilled to begin her role with Old National Bank as a loan officer. ""My mom went from working at 19 years old at Kmart to sitting with executives at a bank. I'm gonna fulfill my mama's dream. Either I'm going back to nursing school or I'm gonna ask them, can I take over her position at that bank,"" she said. ""She was so excited about that job. She was happy."" Farmer had three adult children and four grandsons, Chambers said.  The day before she was killed, she found out her son, J'Yeon Chambers, was expecting a baby girl, he told CNN. The baby is due in September, the same month his mother was born. ""And so it's just crazy how she gets taken the day after we reveal that we're having the baby. So my child is going to be her basically all over again,"" her son said. ""She gave us the name that she always wanted a girl to be named and we're going to stick with it."" The new details come as CNN has learned more about the victims and wounded in Monday's workplace mass shooting, including the survival of a woman who was seated between two people who were killed. Old National Bank employee Connor Sturgeon, 25, opened fire with an AR15-style rifle in an office conference room and killed five colleagues before he was fatally shot by a responding officer. Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Tommy Elliott, Deana Eckert and James Tutt were shot and killed, police said.  Of the eight people who were wounded, a 26-year-old police officer remains in critical condition after being shot in the head, requiring brain surgery. Woman who was seated between two victims released from hospital One woman who was shot but survived was seated between Farmer and Elliott when the attack began, according to the father of her children, Rex Minrath. Dana Mitchell, an employee at the bank, has returned home from the hospital and is recovering, Minrath told CNN in a phone interview Thursday. She is expected to have surgery in the coming weeks to remove ""the rest of the bullet,"" he said.  ""Dana was in the conference room between Tommy and Juliana. She sat between those two,"" Minrath told CNN. ""And then when they hit the ground, they were all on the ground together. She is fortunate because both of them weren't so lucky."" Mitchell's son, Ross Minrath, posted a series of images and updates about his mother's condition on his Facebook page this week. ""After positive results from blood work and her being an all around badass, my Mom was released from the hospital today,"" he wrote on Tuesday night. ""She is very sore but doing well. Her phone has been at the bank and hopes to start reaching out herself tomorrow."" In one Facebook post, he said the gunshot bruised her lung and that doctors were able to clean the wound on her back. His mother, he added, ""is the toughest I've ever known."" He thanked those who had reached out to the family with well wishes and asked for people to continue to send prayers for his mother. In addition, the first person who was shot inside the bank survived, a city official told CNN. In the shooter's Instagram livestream of the attack, which has since been taken down, the female bank worker said ""good morning"" before the gunman warned her, ""You need to get out of here,"" according to an official familiar with the video. The woman had her back to the gunman as he struggled to get the safety off and load his AR15-style weapon properly. He then shot her in the back, an official previously told CNN. Governor says he's 'empty' after friend's death At a vigil Wednesday, scores of residents and officials gathered Wednesday evening to mourn publicly the employees gunned down at their workplace by a coworker.  ""It's important that we take time to acknowledge those losses and what they mean for us as people and as a community,"" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said during the vigil at the Muhammad Ali Center Plaza. ""So, that later we can gather our energies and focus on preventing these tragedies.""  Greenberg noted the heartbreaking impacts of gun violence in his city beyond Monday's carnage, which unfolded less than a mile from where the vigil was held Wednesday.  ""There will be a time to act. To take steps in honor of those we've lost and to channel our grief and pain into meaningful action. That day is coming,"" the mayor continued. ""Today is to mourn, to lean on each other and support each other."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at the vigil that Elliott, a senior vice president at the bank, was one of his closest friends. ""I'll admit that while I am not angry, I am empty. And I'm sad. And I just keep thinking that maybe we'll wake up,"" Beshear said, his voice breaking.  ""What I know is, I just wish I'd taken an extra moment, made an extra call, tell him how much I care about him. And I know we are all feeling the same. But I also know they hear us now. And that they feel our love,"" Beshear said. Shooter's mother called 911 minutes after massacre began Louisville Metro Police on Wednesday released a series of 911 calls showing the fear and panic both inside and outside the bank during the shooting early Monday morning. In one emergency call, a woman who identified herself as an employee of a different Old National Bank branch told the dispatcher she saw the massacre happen in real time while she was on a video call with colleagues at the scene. ""How do you know you have an active shooter on site?"" the operator asked. ""I just watched it. I just watched it on a Teams meeting. We were having a board meeting,"" she said. ""I saw somebody on the floor. We heard multiple shots and people started saying 'Oh my God,' and then he came into the board room."" Another 911 call came from the gunman's mother, who said her son was headed to the bank with a gun and expressed her shock and confusion. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh my Lord."" The woman said her son ""apparently left a note"" about the incident. ""We don't even own guns. I don't know where he would have gotten a gun."" Other calls came from a bank employee speaking in a whisper who was hiding in a closet, a man who fled the building and took shelter at a nearby dental office, and another caller who hid under a desk inside the building.",0
258,Colorado high school students return to class amid investigation into possible bacterial meningitis deaths of two teachers,"Classes at a Colorado high school have resumed after two teachers died over the weekend after experiencing symptoms of bacterial meningitis, according to school administrators. The two teachers at Eaglecrest High School in Aurora, 24-year-old Madelaine Michelle Schmidt and 63-year-old Judith Briere Geoffroy, experienced symptoms of bacterial meningitis before their deaths, according to a news release from the Arapahoe County Corner's Office.  The coroner's office said they had performed autopsies on Schmidt and Geoffroy, but the causes of death are still pending. They were unable to confirm the absence or the presence of bacterial meningitis. Eaglecrest High School closed Wednesday to allow public health officials to ""identify students or staff who may have been in close contact with the infected staff person,"" the Cherry Creek School District said in a letter sent to parents Tuesday. ""Arapahoe County Public Health will reach out directly to all staff members and families of students determined to be in close contact,"" the letter said. ""Those individuals will be offered preventative antibiotics."" The district added that school and district mental health support staff will be available for students. Bacterial meningitis can cause death in just a few hours or permanent disabilities for those who recover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria is usually spread from person to person. Symptoms include fever, headaches, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and ""altered mental status (confusion),"" according to the CDC.",0

260,What we know about the victims of the bank shooting in Louisville,"Bank employees, an ""incredible friend,"" a beloved parishioner, police officers and a ""huge fan and supporter"" of the community are among the five people killed and others hospitalized after a gunman opened fire inside a bank in downtown Louisville. Monday's attack was the 146th US mass shooting this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and came exactly two weeks after three children and three adults were shot to death at a Christian school in neighboring Tennessee, fueling a fierce fight between Democratic and Republican state lawmakers over gun control. In Louisville, a 26-year-old rookie officer ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. Nickolas Wilt, who had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting, underwent brain surgery and on Tuesday was in critical but stable condition, a hospital spokesperson said. Nine patients, including three Louisville Metro Police officers, were treated at University of Louisville Hospital following the shooting, the spokesperson said. Five had gunshot wounds; one died Monday night. Here's what we know so far about those killed: Joshua Barrick Joshua Barrick, 40, was a ""devoted husband, father, son, brother, and friend"" who ""would do anything for anyone and cherished his time with them,"" his brother Jeff Barrick told CNN in a statement. Joshua ""had a wonderful sense of humor, was sentimental, and was passionate about life,"" his brother said. Joshua Barrick and his family were members of the Holy Trinity Parish Louisville, the church wrote on Facebook.  ""Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,"" they wrote. ""Please keep the entire Barrick family in your prayers, including his wife, Jessica, and their two sweet children, who are students in our school.""  ""His involvement with Holy Trinity gave him a sense of purpose and community,"" his brother said. ""He will be missed by all that knew him."" The church held a vigil Monday evening for Barrick.

""He was about lifting people up, building them up."" Elliott, 63, was also close friends with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott's wife. ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and called the others who were killed ""amazing people"" who will be missed and mourned by their communities. ""To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,"" Greenberg added. Old National Bank executive team members, including CEO Jim Ryan, were in Louisville on Monday after the shooting, the company said on Facebook.

""I only got two weeks with her here in Louisville ... a city she knew nothing about. I'm heartbroken.""  Farmer was thrilled to begin her role with Old National Bank as a loan officer, Chambers said, after moving to Louisville two weeks ago from Henderson.  ""My mom went from working at 19 years old at Kmart to sitting with executives at a bank,"" she said. ""I'm gonna fulfill my mama's dream. Either I'm going back to nursing school or I'm gonna ask them, can I take over her position at that bank.""  Farmer had three adult children and four grandsons, Chambers said.  The day before she was killed -- Easter Sunday -- Farmer had found out her son, J'Yeon Chambers, was expecting a baby girl, he told CNN. The baby is due in September, the same month his mother was born. ""It's just crazy how she gets taken the day after we reveal that we're having the baby,"" he said. ""My child is going to be her basically all over again,"" Farmer's son said. ""She gave us the name that she always wanted a girl to be named, and we're going to stick with it.""

263,Amazon is 'investing heavily' in the technology behind ChatGPT,"Amazon wants investors to know it won't be left behind in the latest Big Tech arms race over artificial intelligence. In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company is ""investing heavily"" in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, the same technology that underpins ChatGPT and other similar AI chatbots. ""We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences,"" Jassy wrote in his letter to shareholders.  The remarks, which were part of Jassy's second annual letter to shareholder since taking over as CEO, hint at the pressure that many tech companies feel to explain how they can tap into the rapidly evolving marketplace for AI products. Since ChatGPT was released to the public in late November, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all talked up their growing focus on generative AI technology, which can create compelling essays, stories and visuals in response to user prompts. Amazon's goal, according to Jassy, is to offer less costly machine learning chips so that ""small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production."" Large language models are trained on vast troves of data in order to generate responses to user prompts.   ""Most companies want to use these large language models, but the really good ones take billions of dollars to train and many years, most companies don't want to go through that,"" Jassy said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday morning. ""What they want to do is they want to work off of a foundational model that's big and great already, and then have the ability to customize it for their own purposes,"" Jassy told CNBC.  With that in mind, Amazon on Thursday unveiled a new service called Bedrock. It essentially makes foundation models (large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data) from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI and Amazon accessible to clients via an API, Amazon said in a blog post.  Jassy told CNBC he thinks Bedrock ""will change the game for people.""  In his letter to shareholders, Jassy also touted AWS's CodeWhisperer, another AI-powered tool which he said ""revolutionizes developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time.""  ""I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I'll leave that for a future letter,"" Jassy wrote. ""Let's just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.""  In the letter, Jassy also reflected on leading Amazon through ""one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,"" as the e-commerce giant cut some 27,000 jobs as part of a major bid to rein in costs in recent months.  ""There were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year,"" Jassy said in the letter, before outlining steps Amazon took to rethink certain free shipping options, abandon some of its physical store concepts and significantly reduce overall headcount. Amazon disclosed in a securities filing Thursday that Jassy's pay package last year was valued at some $1.3 million, and that the CEO did not receive any new stock awards in 2022. (When Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, he was awarded a pay package mostly comprised of stock awards that valued his total compensation package at some $212 million.) Despite the challenges at Amazon, however, Jassy said in his letter that he finds himself ""optimistic and energized by what lies ahead."" Jassy added: ""I strongly believe that our best days are in front of us.""",0
264,The owner of Tiffany and Dior gets a boost from China's reopening,"Shares in LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, jumped to a record high after it reported strong first-quarter sales buoyed by the economic re-opening in China. The stock of Europe's most valuable company rose 4.6% Thursday to hit €875 ($965) apiece, boosting the fortune of its owner Bernard Arnault, already the world's richest man.   LVMH was targeted by opponents of French President Emmanuel Macron's pension reforms on Thursday. Protesters taking part in a nationwide strike against an increase in the retirement age forced their way into the company's headquarters in Paris.  ""If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,"" Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the building.   The owner of brands such as Tiffany & Co. and Dior reported late on Wednesday sales of €21 billion ($17 billion) in the first three months of the year, up 17% from the same period in 2022.  The conglomerate said first-quarter sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 14% year-over-year, which represented a ""significant rebound."" Sales were lifted by the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in Asia, LVMH said in a statement. China ended its strict zero-Covid policy in December.  ""We registered some pretty nice pick-up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,"" Jean-Jacques Guinoy, LVMH's chief financial officer, said Wednesday.  The company's cosmetics lines were still a ""little under pressure"" in mainland China, Guinoy added, though leather goods and jewelry were performing well in the world's second-biggest economy.  ""Overall, we are extremely optimistic,"" he said.  In Europe and Japan, first-quarter sales were strong, rising 24% and 34% respectively, thanks to ""robust demand"" from local consumers and international travelers. In the United States, sales rose 8%.  Stocks in the $460 billion company have rocketed 29% since the start of the year, with the luxury goods market proving resilient in the face of high global inflation and fears that some economies could tip into recession.  Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, overtook Elon Musk to become the world's richest person in December, with a total net worth of $198 billion to Musk's $176 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. — Oliver Briscoe and Xiaofei Xu in Paris contributed reporting.",0
265,Why Walmart is closing half its stores in Chicago,"Walmart plans to close half its stores in Chicago, a reversal of the retail giant's high-profile commitment in 2020 to expand in the city as part of its corporate racial justice initiative in the wake of George Floyd's murder by police. Walmart announced Tuesday that next week it will close four poor-performing stores out of the eight it operates in Chicago. Three of the locations are located in Chicago's South and West Side neighborhoods, which are predominantly minority and have long struggled with grocery and retail access. One of the stores is in Chicago's North Side, which is predominantly White and more affluent. The announcement comes after Walmart highlighted its efforts in Chicago as a ""critical part"" of its broader $100 million pledge to advancing racial equity in 2020.  ""Chicago will be an example of what's possible when we leverage business, government and community organizations for the good of all,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in 2021. It also follows more than a decade of intense efforts by Chicago political leaders to draw Walmart and other chains to underserved areas to spur economic development. But Walmart said Tuesday that these four stores lose tens of millions of dollars a year and that annual losses have nearly doubled in the last five years. The company said it tried several strategies to improve the stores and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the city. ""Unfortunately, these efforts have not materially improved the fundamental business challenges our stores are facing,"" Walmart said in a blog post. The company said workers in these stores will be eligible to switch to other Walmart stores and it will work with local leaders to help find reuse options for the buildings.  Walmart said its remaining four Chicago stores ""continue to face the same business difficulties,"" but it believes closing these four will give the others the best chance of staying open. The closures call attention to the recent pullback in major US cities by Walmart and other national chains. They also raise questions about the effectiveness of government strategies that closely rely on national chains to improve food and retail access in underserved areas. David Merriman, a professor of public policy, management and analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago, found in a 2012 study of Walmart's impact in Chicago that businesses closer to Walmart were significantly more likely to close than similar businesses farther away. The study also found that the number of jobs lost by nearby retail competitors essentially offset the number of jobs created at the new Walmart stores. ""Communities around the city shouldn't see Walmart or other big-box retailers as a panacea for local economic problems,"" he said. 'An example of what's possible' In 2020, Walmart temporarily closed all eight of its stores in Chicago during protests in the city and across the country over Floyd's murder by police. There were fears that Walmart and other businesses would leave Chicago, but Walmart pledged to stay and invest in the city.  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Walmart's McMillon announced in June 2020 that Walmart would reopen its stores and also build two health centers and a training academy for employees in Chicago.  ""Walmart's commitment to Chicago remains strong. We are not going anywhere,"" McMillon said.  He also said at the time that Walmart's stores in Chicago collectively operate at a loss due to a ""combination of our sales, product margin and expenses."" He said Walmart would try to reduce losses without raising prices or cutting workers' wages or hours.  Walmart ""may have to revisit these decisions again"" if they weren't working after a few years, he cautioned, ""but that's not what we hope for or plan on.""  A year later, McMillon said ""Walmart wants to serve the people of this great city, build a successful business and work with those who are determined to see Chicago fulfill its potential."" In a statement Tuesday, Lightfoot said she was ""incredibly disappointed that Walmart, a strong partner in the past,"" was closing stores. ""Unceremoniously abandoning these neighborhoods will create barriers to basic needs for thousands of residents,"" she said. ""I call on Walmart to ensure that these soon-to-be-closed stores are repurposed with significant community engagement so they can find a new use to serve their neighborhoods."" Struggles in cities Walmart's decision follows years of attempts by the company to move into big US cities. Walmart expanded in rural and suburban areas during the 1980s and 1990s and began to try to enter cities in the early 2000s. But the company was met with stiff resistance in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities from unions and Democratic opponents who worried non-union Walmart would drive down wages and hurt small businesses. In 2006, Walmart overcame opposition in Chicago and opened its first store. Chicago's mayor at that time, Richard M. Daley, paved the way for Walmart by vetoing an ordinance requiring all big-box stores to pay their employees a $10 minimum wage.  Other Chicago leaders saw bringing in Walmart and national chains as a way to boost the economy and provide access to fresh food in Chicago's predominantly Black South Side area. ""This Wal-Mart is a win-win-win — a win for the local economy, a win for local job creation, and a win for the Chicagoans,"" Chicago's then-mayor Rahm Emanuel said in 2012 when Walmart opened a store in the city's Chatham neighborhood. (It's one of the stores now slated for closure.) But this strategy was misplaced, said Stacy Mitchell, the co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration. She believes the city should have taken stronger efforts to support smaller grocers who have been squeezed by big chains. ""Chicago city leaders bent over backwards to lure Walmart to the city,"" she said. ""What they should have been doing was supporting the development of local businesses with a real commitment to the city and its residents.""  Walmart is retrenching in some cities. It has also closed stores in Portland, Oregon, recently.  The benefits of Walmart's ability to drive down costs and keep prices low have proven less effective in cities. Walmart's typical 180,000 square-foot supercenter model is not as well suited for urban neighborhoods as it is for suburban and rural areas, said Ray Wimer, a professor of retail practice at Syracuse University.  Walmart is also not the only national chain that has closed stores in major cities. A Whole Foods flagship closed in San Francisco on Monday, citing concerns about worker safety. Walgreens and CVS have also closed in San Francisco and New York, while Starbucks closed 16 locations across various cities. These retailers face several challenges in cities. Urban locations carry higher rents, which means they need to hit higher sales targets to break even, Wimer told CNN. Some retailers have also cited higher levels of theft and other crime in their city stores. In addition, Covid-19 pandemic safety lockdowns and the rise of remote work have hurt foot traffic and sales to stores. And the growth of Amazon and same-day delivery has made going to stores less appealing for urban residents.  Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified the location of one of Walmart's shuttered locations.",0

267,More than 100  temperature records could be broken across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday,"Summerlike heat will continue to build across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday, as temperatures soar to as much as 30 degrees above normal.  Nearly 90 daily records could be broken on Thursday and Friday, mainly across the Midwest and Northeast, and at least 50 record-high minimum temperatures could be set.  This comes after more than 35 daily record highs were broken on Wednesday from Nebraska to Delaware.  Sioux Falls, South Dakota, hit 92 degrees on Wednesday, shattering its old record of 85 set in 1908. Twin Cities, Minnesota, also broke a record after reaching a high of 88 degrees.  Record heat will continue As an area of high pressure continues to build in the region, this will allow for temperatures to continue to warm and dry conditions to prevail.  ""The dry airmass in place makes it quite easy to overachieve on highs and it is certainly possible that we approach 90 again in La Crosse,"" the National Weather Service office in La Crosse, Wisconsin, said. If La Crosse hits 90, that would shatter their old record of 80 degrees. The heat will stretch as far as the Northeast and parts of New England, with New York City expected to top out in the mid-80s, which will come close to tying or breaking records for Thursday and Friday.  Cities including Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington and even Boston could set records this week.  ""Most areas away from Cape Cod, the immediate south coast and the North Shore should see their first 80 degree day since Sept/Oct 2022, and it is not out of the question that the Hartford and Springfield CT Valley areas could get very close to or reach 90,"" the weather service office in Boston said. Overnight lows are also staying warm, which doesn't allow for much recovery from the heat. More than 75 record-high minimum temperatures could be set by Saturday morning.  Warm temperatures, along with low humidity levels and gusty winds, will create an elevated risk of wildfires. Elevated fire risk  The weather service is warning of an elevated fire risk while the record warmth and dry conditions persist. ""Fine fuels in the form of dry or dead vegetation will be quite dry as well, and conducive to fire starts and fairly quick fire spread,"" the weather service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, warned. ""This is particularly true in areas that have not received hardly any rainfall in the last 10 days, across much of Pennsylvania to northern and central New Jersey."" Winds could gust as high as 35 mph, which will cause any fire that forms to spread quickly. A wildfire has already broken out in New Jersey this week. The fire is now 75% contained, but it has already scorched roughly 4,000 acres and forced evacuations.",0

269,The Juice mission will soon launch to Jupiter's icy ocean worlds,"The European Space Agency is about to send a spacecraft to explore Jupiter and three of its largest and most intriguing moons. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission, or Juice, was expected to lift off Thursday at 8:15 a.m. ET aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. But a lightning risk postponed the launch, which has been rescheduled for Friday at 8:14 a.m. ET. Watch the launch live on ESA's website or YouTube channel. Weather can often cause launch delays and postponements. Specific weather criteria must be met in order for rockets to safely lift off. The James Webb Space Telescope, which launched aboard an Ariane 5 from the same location in December 2021, also faced similar delays due to adverse weather conditions around Kourou. Once launched, the spacecraft will separate from the Ariane 5 launcher after 28 minutes. Over the course of the next 17 days, Juice will deploy its solar arrays, antennas and other instruments, followed by three months of testing and preparing the instruments. Juice will take eight years to reach Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. During its lengthy cruise, the spacecraft will utilize some gravitational slingshots as it flies by Earth, our moon and Venus to help with the journey. INTERACTIVE: The search for life in our solar system Once Juice arrives at Jupiter in July 2031, the spacecraft will spend about three and a half years orbiting the gas giant and conducting flybys of three of its moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. Toward the end of the mission, Juice will focus solely on orbiting Ganymede, making it the first spacecraft to ever orbit a moon in the outer solar system. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa are ice-covered worlds that may contain subsurface oceans that are potentially habitable for life. Meanwhile, NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launching in 2024, is expected to reach Jupiter in April 2030 and conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, eventually reaching just 16 miles (25 kilometers) above the moon's surface. Together, the two missions could unlock some of the biggest mysteries about Jupiter and its moons. Up close with the king of the solar system Exploration of Jupiter began with NASA's Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s, followed by dedicated Jupiter missions like Galileo and the Juno probe. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter and flying by some of its moons since 2016.  The Juice mission has five main objectives, including using its powerful suite of 10 instruments to characterize the three icy moons and determine whether they harbor oceans, uncover what makes Ganymede so unique and determine if the moons are potentially habitable for life.  Planetary scientists want to know how deep the oceans are, if they contain salty or fresh water and how that water interacts with the ice shell of each moon. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa also have different surfaces. Juice could reveal what kind of activity has caused some of them to look dark and cratered or paler and grooved. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, larger than Pluto and Mercury, and it's the only one that has a magnetic field similar to Earth. Juice's instruments can reveal the moon's rotation, gravity, shape, interior structure and composition and peer through its icy crust using radar. Juice will also conduct a detailed analysis of Jupiter to determine how the complex magnetic and radiation environment around this massive planet shaped its moons, as well as how Jupiter formed in the first place. Understanding more of Jupiter's origin story can help scientists apply those findings to Jupiter-like planets found outside of our solar system.  Jupiter's magnetic field is 20 times stronger than Earth's and it has a harsh radiation environment, both of which impact its moons. The Juice mission was designed to unravel what takes place as Jupiter interacts with its moons, including auroras, hot spots, radio emissions and waves of charged particles. The potential for life Although the three moons are encased in thick ice shells, interior heating could be taking place at each moon's core — and that warmth could make the interior oceans possible habitats for past or existing life. Juice can search the moons for evidence of the building blocks of life, including elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron and magnesium. Previous missions like Galileo and Cassini, which visited Saturn and its moons, confirmed that liquid water can be found on planets and moons far away from the sun — and that water is likely to exist under the surface.  ""I think Juice is a confirmation that our understanding of where to search for potential habitability has changed in the last 20 years,"" said Michele Dougherty, Royal Society research professor at Imperial College London and principal investigator of Juice's magnetometer.  Life as we understand it on Earth requires liquid water, a heat source and organic material — ""and then you need those first three ingredients to be stable enough over a long enough period of time that something can actually happen,"" Dougherty said.  ""With Juice, we want to confirm there's liquid water in these moons, confirm their heat sources. Other instruments will be able to remotely sense whether there's organic material on the surface as well.  And so it's putting all of those ingredients together,"" she said.  Surviving Jupiter Juice's truck-size spacecraft has been designed to survive a long journey to Jupiter — and it has to survive the extremes of the gas giant's environment once it arrives. Two cross-shaped solar arrays will provide the spacecraft with power and lead-lined vaults protect its most sensitive electronics. The ESA-led mission includes contributions from NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. Testing and modeling of Jupiter's radiation belts allowed engineers to prepare for what Juice will encounter. ""A key achievement of this model for us was to show that what at first seemed to be a dangerous place was not completely out of reach,"" said Christian Erd, Juice spacecraft and system manager, in a statement. ""Around three and a half years at Jupiter will involve the equivalent radiation exposure of a telecommunications satellite in geostationary Earth orbit for 20 years — which we have plenty of experience in managing.""  In order to help Juice survive, its trajectory was designed to fly past Callisto 21 times but only swing by Europa twice. Europa is the closest to Jupiter and sits well within its radiation halo. Just two orbits of the moon will cause the spacecraft to experience a third of its overall radiation exposure. Some of Juice's instruments are shielded, while others will be exposed to the elements to probe the atmospheres of Jupiter and its moons. Multiple imagers and sensors will capture and send back data across different wavelengths of light. Given the eventual distance between the spacecraft and Earth, it will take 45 minutes to send a one-way signal to Juice. But that's nothing compared to the years-long wait for Juice to arrive at Jupiter.  Scientists are already anticipating the unique data Juice will return. ""I think the most critical time is the first flyby we have of Ganymede,"" Dougherty said. ""The first one or two flybys is when we are going to confirm the existence of an ocean.""",0

271,Leaked Pentagon documents suggest Russian government infighting over Ukraine,"A fresh leak of classified US intelligence documents suggests broad infighting between Russian officials, including some within the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry, the New York Times reported Thursday.  CNN has not independently verified the documents. The NYT said it had shown the new 27-pages of documents to multiple US officials, who did not dispute the information but ""could not, and would not, independently verify the documents."" CNN has contacted the Pentagon for comment. The US has said that the first set of documents released last week were authentic but has said that some of the documents were not legitimate and had been altered.  The NYT report says the documents, which it reports were posted on one of the Discord servers, show infighting between the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry over Russia's casualty count for the war in Ukraine.  The new documents also indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin called Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to a meeting, believed to have taken place on February 22, to likely resolve a public dispute over ammunition supply, the NYT reports.  Prigozhin had accused Russia's defense establishment of creating ""major problems"" with ammunition supplies for his troops.  He went as far as accusing the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry of ""treason"" for failing to get ammunition to Wagner fighters and ""also not helping with air transport."" On February 23, CNN reported Prigozhin said that a shipment of ammunition was now on its way to his fighters, in a message and voice note published on his Telegram channel. The NYT report says the documents detail US monitoring of Russian intelligence and apparatus and military command. The original batch of highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks and reported on by CNN also revealed the degree to which the US has penetrated the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Wagner Group, largely through intercepted communications and human sources, which could now be cut off or put in danger.  The Kremlin said it doubts the ""reliability"" of reports of broad infighting between Russian officials, in response to a CNN question about the NYT article.  ""I don't know what these reports [of infighting] are based on, but I'm doubting their reliability and the author's understanding of the essence of what is happening inside Russia,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. The leaks on social media in recent weeks have flustered US officials, who fear the revelations about how Washington spies on allies and foes alike could put sensitive sources at risk, and compromise important foreign relationships.  Several of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, disclose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. Others divulge significant weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces prepare to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians -- and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the person behind the massive leak worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. CNN could not verify the article independently.  The Pentagon has also stood up an ""interagency effort"" to assess the impact of the leak, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Sunday, while the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the leaks last week.",0
272,Fear and confusion in Japan's Hokkaido as North Korean missile triggers evacuation order,"A North Korean missile sparked fear on the Japanese northern island of Hokkaido Thursday after the government's emergency alert system warned residents to take cover. Millions of people received a J-alert, or evacuation order, shortly before 8 a.m., urging them to seek shelter as the missile could land on or near the island. But soon after, fear turned into anger and confusion as the evacuation order was lifted amid reports that it had been sent in error, with local officials saying there was no possibility of the missile hitting the island and Tokyo later confirming it had fallen outside Japanese territory, in waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Many residents were critical of the decision to send the alert. ""What is the use of the J-Alert, which warns of a missile falling when you do not know where it will fall?"" asked one Twitter user. ""In the end, it serves no purpose other than to instill in the Japanese people the feeling that Japan is being targeted, and to scare them."" Another Twitter user said that even had the alert been warranted there would have been too little time to find shelter. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno defended the government's response at a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday, but admitted ""We did not correct the information issued by the J-Alert."" He said the alert was ""appropriate"" given the limited information available at the time and said the government had updated the alert once it was determined the missile would not fall near Hokkaido. This is not the first time there have been issues with the J-Alerts. Last October, Japan apologized for the malfunctioning of the early warning system when residents in nine of Tokyo's island towns and villages were mistakenly sent alerts. On that occasion, North Korea had fired a ballistic missile, but it did not pass over the communities who received the alerts. The latest alarm came after North Korea fired what appeared to be a mid or longer range ballistic missile from an area near Pyongyang, at around 7:23 a.m. local time Thursday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The White House said it ""strongly condemns"" the missile test. ""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions and instead choose diplomatic engagement.  The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" Watson added.  The South Korean military believes Pyongyang was testing a new ballistic missile, which it had showcased in a military parade, according to a military official. That missile could be solid-fueled, a type of missile that can be launched more quickly and moved around more easily than the liquid-fueled long-range missiles North Korea has tested in the past. The official added that there is a possibility that North Korea was testing a part of a reconnaissance satellite, such as a sensor. North Korea said last year that it would finish preparations to launch a military reconnaissance satellite by this month. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched at a lofted trajectory, flying about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). Meanwhile, Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said the missile may have been a type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the longest range of North Korea's ballistic missiles, but that Japanese authorities were continuing to analyze details. Hamada added that the missile fell into waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno called the launch ""an outrageous act that escalates provocations against the entire international community. ""North Korea's series of actions, including its repeated launches of ballistic missiles, is a threat to Japan, the region and the world,"" Matsuno said. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launch a ""significant act of provocation"" and urged Pyongyang to immediately stop, reiterating that ballistic missile launches are in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Thursday's launch marked the 12th day this year when North Korea has fired at least one missile.",0
273,Former J-pop star alleges sexual abuse by late Japanese music mogul Johnny Kitagawa,"A former J-pop star trainee came forward with allegations Wednesday that he and multiple other young men were sexually abused by the late Johnny Kitagawa, once a powerful figure in Japan's entertainment industry.  Japanese-Brazilian singer-songwriter Kauan Okamoto alleged during a press conference that over the course of four years, beginning in 2012 when he was 15, he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Kitagawa, who died age 87 in 2019. Okamoto said the abuse happened when he would stay overnight at one of Kitagawa's penthouse apartments in Tokyo, often with other young aspiring musicians who were also signed to Kitagawa's talent agency, Johnny & Associates. Okamoto made the allegations during a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan Wednesday, saying he was speaking out now in the hope that other alleged victims will come forward.  During his long career, Kitagawa headed Japan's biggest talent agency and was known for manufacturing popular boy-bands and launching the music and acting careers of teen idols. He was a powerful and influential figure in the media and entertainment industries for decades. Johnny & Associates sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the allegations. ""Since shifting to a new management team upon the death of our former President in 2019, we have made it our utmost priority to adapt to the changing environment by establishing transparency in our organizational structure and policies in a manner that evokes social trust,"" the statement said. ""In January 2023, we announced measures that will ensure strict compliance with laws and regulations without exception by both management and employees as well as the steps we are taking to strengthen corporate governance by consulting with impartial third party experts,"" it continued, without directly addressing the allegations. There have been long-standing allegations against Kitagawa. In 1999, Japanese magazine Shukan Bunshun published accounts of other young men and boys who claimed they were sexually abused by Kitagawa. He sued the magazine for libel and was awarded damages, according to local media. A Tokyo High Court partially overturned the earlier decision in 2003, ruling the published sexual abuse claims were not libelous. An appeal brought by Kitagawa was later dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2005. Kitagawa was never charged over the allegations. He had reportedly denied all accusations when he was alive.  They 'knew it was my turn' Singer-songwriter Okamoto joined Kitagawa's agency in February 2012 while he was in junior high school. He became a member of Johnny's Juniors, a J-pop trainee talent pool set up by Kitagawa for young hopefuls trying to make it in the industry.  Okamoto said Kitagawa would often invite these young recruits to spend the night in his apartment, and pick ""favorites"" among the boys. He told reporters that when Kitagawa told him ""you should go to bed early,"" the other Juniors ""knew that it was my turn."" He claims the first time Kitagawa sexually assaulted him was in March 2012. That day work had finished late and he stayed at Kitagawa's place with other Juniors. Okamoto said he had heard from other boys that Kitagawa would be ""in a very bad mood the next day if you didn't go to sleep in his room or a room nearby."" He describes hearing Kitagawa's slippers approaching his room, pulling off the futon he was sleeping under and lying down next to him.  ""He began massaging my feet,"" Okamoto said, and alleged that Kitagawa touched his genitals and performed oral sex on him. Okamoto said the following day Kitagawa gave him 10,000 yen (about US$75) without giving a reason.  By the time Okamoto left Johnny & Associates in 2016, he alleged that he had been assaulted between 15 and 20 times by Kitagawa.  He said he saw between 100 and 200 Juniors rotating in and out of the apartment during the four years he was with the agency, and alleged the majority of them were similarly assaulted by Kitagawa.  ""There were things I saw. In some instances it happened right next to me because we were sleeping in the same room. I would say three other members for sure, but to be honest I think that almost everyone fell victim to him because as long as we stayed at his place it would be very rare that someone would be unscathed,"" he said, adding that he believes ""the majority of the 100 to 200 during my time experienced that."" For a long time, Okamoto said he couldn't talk about his experiences.  ""There are others... who have decided to stay anonymous. I chose to show my face. But that might change as well. That is the hope that I have,"" he said.  Okamoto also alleged that if a boy refused Kitagawa's advances, their career would be over.  While Kitagawa ""would never directly or explicitly mention that if you don't do so and so, you won't be a success,"" Okamoto said, his favorites would be picked for their debuts as entertainers and receive more opportunities. ""It was a special situation in that someone who would be standing next to Johnny-san would be picked to, for example, act in a TV program or be allowed to form a boyband."" He said it was ""general awareness among everyone"" that ""you have to be at his place to succeed, so you have to even take the initiative to be at his place."" Okamoto said he was frustrated that long-standing allegations against Kitagawa had not been taken seriously. Okamoto said because of Kitagawa, ""my life did turn around"" but ""I also believe what Johnny-san did to me...and to the other Juniors was a bad thing.""",0

275,US wholesale inflation saw dramatic cooldown in March,"US inflation at the wholesale level continued its downward slide in March with annualized price increases sinking dramatically to 2.7% from an upwardly revised 4.9%, according to the Producer Price Index released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  It's the lowest annual level for the key inflation gauge since January 2021. On a monthly basis, producer prices slumped by 0.5%, driven by falling goods prices, specifically lower energy prices. Prices for fresh and dry vegetables also fell, as did services, while the price indexes for categories such as light motor trucks, chicken eggs and meats moved higher. Economists were expecting annual inflation, as measured by the PPI, to land at 3% for the 12 months ended in March and for no change from the month before.  ""It's good news that it looks like inflation is coming off the boil here,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, told CNN. ""There is a pronounced slowing in producer goods, and if I had to bet, I would say that this is going to lead to lower prices for the goods sitting on the store shelves in the coming months."" Core PPI, which excludes the more volatile components of food and energy, declined 0.1% for the month and, for the 12 months ended in March was up 3.4%, down from the upwardly revised level of 4.8%. PPI is one of several closely watched inflation gauges. Because the producer-centric index captures price shifts upstream of the consumer, it's sometimes looked to as a potential leading indicator of how prices may eventually land at the store level. Since notching a 11.2% gain in June 2022, the PPI has seen a stark cooldown in the months since, as supply chains have got back into sync since being discombobulated by the pandemic and the sharp economic recovery that followed.  Consumer prices have come down as well, but at a more moderate pace.  The March Consumer Price Index, released Wednesday, was 5%, the lowest annualized rate since May of 2021, according to the BLS. Much like CPI, the annual PPI also appears to have benefited from base effects, when year-over-year comparisons are volatile. In March 2022, a time when Russia had just invaded Ukraine and food and energy prices skyocketed, the PPI shot up to a record 11.7%. Month-to-month comparisons can be volatile, but the the PPI's 0.5% drop seen in March did follow an unchanged reading in February.  Jobless claims on the rise Separately on Thursday, the Department of Labor released the latest snapshot of jobless claims.  Initial weekly claims for unemployment insurance climbed to 239,000 for the week ended April 8, the highest level since January 2022. Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received unemployment benefits for more than one week, dropped to 1.81 million for the week ended April 1, from 1.82 million the week before.  Weekly jobless claims, considered a proxy for layoffs, can be volatile and frequently subject to revision. Last week, the Labor Department made a series of significant adjustments to recent years' data to better account for pandemic-era dynamics. As of Thursday's report, the four-week average for weekly claims was 240,000, slightly higher than what was seen before the onset of the pandemic. ""The labor market is softening,"" Rupkey said. ""And it's not just softening, it's starting to look worrisome."" Unemployment is an indicator of recession, which Federal Reserve economists say became more likely following last month's banking crisis, according to the minutes from the central bank's March policy meeting released Wednesday.  Rupkey said the latest employment picture indicates a 50-50 chance of a downturn, but trends could become more clear in the coming weeks. ""When the labor market becomes unglued, it is like a runaway train: The layoffs start, and no one can stop it. It's too late, and the Fed's policy tightening has done too much,"" he said.  ""So right now, we're not quite there. ... If initial claims fall back under 200,000, where they were for a couple of weeks at the start of the year, then OK, the recession is off. But if it climbs further — 250,000, 260,000 — I would be worried,"" he said.",0

280,Delta Air Lines reports record bookings for summer travel,"Delta Air Lines reported record advanced bookings for this coming summer, a further sign that the US airline industry is putting the pandemic-caused losses behind it. But rising labor costs did result in a net loss in the period, even if the company reported a profit when excluding special items, the measure most closely followed by investors. The Atlanta-based airline earned $163 million, excluding special items, in the first three months of the year, compared to a loss of $784 million on that basis a year earlier. Revenue of $11.8 billion was up 45% from a year earlier, and up 14% from the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. The strong demand for flying means higher fares for customers. The amount passengers paid to fly each mile on Delta was up 17% compared to both a year earlier and the same period in 2019. Total passenger revenue when adjusted for capacity, another key measure of fares, was up 27% compared to a year ago and 14% from the same period in 2019. And planes were fuller, with Delta selling 81% of available seats, up from 75% a year earlier. The second quarter revenue and earnings were slightly below Wall Street forecasts, which the company attributed to flights canceled due to bad weather. But shares of Delta were higher in pre-market trading due to its strong forecast going forward.  The company said the record second-quarter bookings will allow it to post earnings per share of between $2 and $2.25, well above the current forecast of $1.66. For the full year, the company expects earnings per share of between $5 and $6, which could put it well above the $5.40 forecast from analysts. The company did take a one-time charge of $864 million related to the four-year labor deal it reached with pilots that will increase their pay 34% over the life of the contract. It provides them with an immediate 18% raise and a signing bonus that cost the airline $735 million. The charge for that signing bonus and change in benefits resulted in a net loss in the quarter of $363 million.  The airline also gave 5% raises to many of its other employees as of April 1. The pilots are the only major employee group at Delta who are union members. Other major US airlines, which are far more heavily unionized, face upcoming negotiations with a majority of their employees, and could also see rising labor costs in upcoming financial results.",0

Food prices American consumers are finally seeing a dip in grocery prices for the first time since 2020, according to new data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The meats, poultry, fish and eggs index fell 1.4%, pulled down by another month of large decreases in egg prices. In previous months, the cost of eggs surged primarily due to avian flu, which constrained supply. Some egg producers were also taking advantage of the disruption by raising prices to boost profits. Among the other foods showing a decrease, fruits and vegetable prices fell 1.3%, and dairy products ticked down 0.1%. However, some other indexes like beverages, cereals and bakery products, went up. This comes as groceries still remain expensive on an annual basis as US consumers contend with high inflation. 2. Trump Former President Donald Trump is expected to be back in New York City today to sit for another deposition for the civil lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The suit was brought against him, his children and the Trump Organization, alleging they were involved in an expansive scheme lasting over a decade by providing false financial statements to lenders and others that the former president used to enrich himself. Trump previously sat for a deposition for the case in August 2022, when he refused to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. It remains unclear whether he will be more willing to cooperate this time around. Trump's trip to New York comes on the heels of his unprecedented indictment last month when he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to 34 charges of falsifying business records. 3. Leaked documents The person behind a massive leak of classified US documents worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. According to the reporting, which CNN is working to independently verify, the Post described the alleged leaker as a lonely young man and gun enthusiast. He shared the classified material in a chatroom of about two dozen people on Discord -- a social media platform popular with video gamers. Some Discord users thought the documents were fake because they didn't think anyone would be brazen enough to post them online, according to a CNN review of messages on the platform. Discord said it is cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation, but declined to comment further. 4. Abortion A court order late Wednesday said a medication abortion drug can remain available for now, days after a federal judge in Texas ordered its approval to be suspended. Last Friday, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk issued a ruling that would have halted the FDA's 23-year-old approval of the drug, mifepristone. Under the appeals court's new order, the approval will stay in effect and the drug will remain on the market while an expedited appeal plays out, though some restrictions remain. It is unclear if the Justice Department or the drug's manufacturer will ask the Supreme Court to intervene at this point. This comes as the legal battle over medication abortion continues to intensify after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. 5. North Korea Millions of people in Japan this morning received a J-alert, or an evacuation order, urging them to seek shelter after North Korea launched a missile in their direction. The alert sparked fear on the Japanese northern island of Hokkaido after officials said the missile could land on or near the island. But soon after, fear turned into anger and confusion as the evacuation order was lifted amid reports that the alert had been sent in error, with officials saying there was no possibility of the missile hitting the area. Tokyo later confirmed the missile had fallen outside Japanese territory, in waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula.

284,"April 12, 2023 Latest on the Louisville bank shooting","Whitney Austin, who survived a 2018 mass shooting of a bank in Cincinnati, Ohio, called for gun reform during her remarks at Wednesday's vigil in Louisville, Kentucky.  ""Monday morning was heartbreakingly familiar to me. I've done this before,"" said Austin, who was shot 12 times during the mass 2018 shooting. She encouraged the community to lift the victims and first responders in prayer and support them.  She also advocated for gun reform, ""It is only through action that change will ever come.""  The Louisville Metro Police Department has released all of the 911 calls it plans to distribute from the bank shooting, according to department spokesperson Aaron Ellis. Twelve 911 calls and two emergency responder radio transmissions were released Wednesday. ##911 Audio## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence A woman called 911 on Monday morning after seeing an officer go down after being shot at outside Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky.  “We saw one officer down,” the woman relays to the dispatcher. Another witness describes the scene to the dispatcher as they watched the incident from across the street. “I just wanted to make sure you understood that there was an officer down,” the male witness tells the dispatcher. “There are several officers here now, but the one hasn’t moved since he’s been shot. Two have been shot at.” “I’ve been watching him consistently, I haven’t seen a foot or anything moving,” he added, “He went down right away when the bullets started firing,” Officer Nickolas Wilt is in critical condition after he was shot in the head during a confrontation with the gunman. His colleague, Officer Cory “CJ” Galloway, suffered a minor bullet wound. ##911 Audio## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. Additional  911 calls released by the Louisville Metro Police Department detail concerns from employees in the bank building where the shooting took place on Monday.   “We are on the 4th floor, we are trying to get the status of what’s going on,” the caller says, “We’re tucked under a desk right now.” The 911 operator calmly tells the caller to remain in place as police officers clear the building: “As far as my understanding, the shooter has been taken into custody. As far as my understanding, the scene is safe at the moment.”  The shooter was killed in a gun battle with police at the scene.  The 911 operator tells the caller everyone should stay put while officers search the building to make sure there were no other threats. The caller agrees and says all the doors are locked.  “Officers may be coming toward that area and they will be announcing themselves as officers,” the operator says. ##911 Audio## Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan had a message for employees attending the community vigil in Louisville and watching virtually: “To all of you please know we will get through this together."" A mass shooter, who police said was an employee, opened fire at the bank on Monday morning, killing five people and injuring several others. Ryan said there are ""no words"" to describe what happened or how the victim's families are feeling. ""The greatest way we can continue to honor everyone that has been impacted by this tragedy is to do our best to follow their example,"" he said. ""We need to love one another, we need to care for one another and we need to support one another."" He said he is praying for both the employees and police officers that were hurt and are still recovering and thanked first responders, medical teams and the Louisville community for their support. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear responded Wednesday to the release of 911 audio from the deadly Louisville bank shooting.  ""This person murdered my friend. But still, I can't imagine how his parents must be feeling. Right now,"" Beshear said.  Beshear's friend Tommy Elliott, a bank executive, was killed by the gunman.  The governor said he wanted his friend to be remembered as a loving father and husband.  ""Man, he had a great smile. His eyes lit up. Loved life. Was always into something. Trying to make the city a better place, he was just always into something,"" he said, in his first interview since the tragic shooting, with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Elliott, the bank's senior vice president, had chaired Beshear's 2019 inaugural committee and was a well-known figure in Kentucky Democratic politics. ""He was trying to plan for me for when I'm done being governor, which was something that I hoped we could eventually plan for together,"" Beshear said. ""An amazing human being, a loving dad."" One of the 911 calls released Wednesday included one from the mother of the gunman.  Relaying details from her son's roommate, she said her son ""apparently left a note"" as she expressed her shock and confusion. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said in the call. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh, my Lord."" Hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear here: ##911 Audio## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said there will be a time for action and change, but now is a time to mourn those killed in a mass shooting at a bank Monday. At a community vigil Wednesday evening, the mayor said whether people knew any of the victims personally or not, it is important to “acknowledge that every violent death is tragic."" He said it's also important to support those who survived the shooting through their physical and mental healing. “We are all in pain right now,"" he said. “Everyone I’ve spoken to since Monday is sharing some version of the same experience – and too many people have had this experience before this week,"" Greenberg added, referring to the dozens of people he said have been killed by gun violence in the city so far this year. He said the vigil and other kinds of reflection are important so that grief can be turned into action. ""That day is coming. Today is to mourn,"" Greenberg said. The mayor also thanked the people who have brought ""light and love"" during a tragic week, including first responders and police officers. A second batch of 911 calls from the Old National Bank mass shooting has been released by the Louisville Metro Police Department Tuesday evening. The additional audio includes six clips of calls to 911 from the shooting and one clip of LMPD radio traffic. CNN is looking through the calls. ##911 Audio## The FBI is asking for people in Louisville, Kentucky, to share what they know about the mass shooting that killed at least five people at a bank earlier this week. FBI Louisville said there are two ways for people to submit tips, images for videos: Submit information at fbi.gov/bankshooting
            Call 502-574-LMPD It’s still not clear what provoked the 25-year-old bank employee to open fire. Workers inside Old National Bank during Monday's mass shooting were desperate for help as police responded to the scene, 911 calls from the incident revealed.  “We have an active shooter in our building,” a male caller inside the building said, identifying the shooter as “an employee of Old National Bank.”
            “Get here now! We need somebody now!” the caller said. Another man who spoke to 911 after fleeing the bank building and entering a dental office nearby said he ""did not see"" the shooter.  ""I just saw a shotgun as he was coming around the corner,” he said. “People have been shot.” The caller said he believed there were more than a dozen people in the room as shots were fired. “Please get people there fast, please… and ambulances, please” he said. “We’re going to get them out there,” the operator responded. “Keep yourself safe, OK? Stay in a safe location.” ##911 Audio## Radio transmissions made in the wake of the shooting released by Louisville police Wednesday show how EMS responded and organized to get medical attention to those inside the building. Emergency responders on the radio calls discussed and coordinated where the victims were located inside the building, their conditions, and who was responding. Here's what they said:  “The shooter has been eliminated…and they’re doing a search of the building at this time,” one responder radios.  Another says that there is “possibly a female hiding in the bathroom” who is on the phone with emergency services.  “We have one victim that’s been brought out to the corner of Preston and Main,” another responder radios.  Several emergency responders radio back and forth about the status of a police officer who was wounded before learning that the officer was already being transported to a hospital. “Where’s the officer?” someone asks.  “That’s what I’m trying to figure out,” another person replies, adding later that “the officer is actually being transported in the police car right now.” Other emergency staff give updates over the radio on victims they located inside.  “We have a patient also in the building…the center of the building, first floor bathroom. Female shot in the leg,” someone radios before new reports of more victims found come over the radio.  “Just to add to your count, we have another victim. It looks like a gunshot wound to the (redacted),” another emergency responder reports.  During the radio calls, emergency staff is told that a command center is being set up at the Slugger baseball stadium and everyone is told to bring any witnesses to the stadium. In one call over the radio, an emergency responder says they’re being diverted from the location to handle another shooting in the city.  “We’re responding to another shooting…at the Goodwill,” the person radios. Radio transmissions also describe officers arriving at the shooter’s house, encountering individuals there and ultimately securing the home.  “Cleared the house from what I understand,” a person radios.  ##911 Audio## Officials in Louisville, Kentucky, are preparing to host a vigil tonight to grieve the five people killed this week in a downtown bank shooting.  The city will hold a vigil at 5 p.m. ET Wednesday at the Muhammad Ali Center, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. The vigil will “acknowledge the wounds, physical and emotional, that gun violence leaves behind,” Greenberg told reporters Tuesday. “It will be an interfaith opportunity for our entire community to come together – to grieve, to heal, to begin to move forward.” A woman who called 911 said she saw a man with some type of assault rifle and bulletproof vest “jogging around” near the time of the shooting in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday. When the dispatcher asked if the person was shooting, she said, “No, ma’am he was kind of like jogging around like he was trying to get somewhere in a hurry.”   Though that's how the woman described the shooter, the gunman was not wearing a bulletproof vest, according to surveillance video during the shooting. The 911 call is among a set of calls that were released by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) on Wednesday related to the mass shooting that left five people dead. Yesterday, LMPD released dramatic bodycam video of officers responding to the attack.  This post has been updated throughout. ##911 Audio## A woman called 911 from inside Old National Bank in Louisville as she was hiding in a closet in the building during Monday’s shooting. The woman, who worked at the bank, told the dispatcher she believed eight or nine people were shot.  “I know who it is. He’s probably 6 feet tall; he’s a young male,” the woman told the dispatcher.  When the dispatcher asked the woman how she knew the gunman, she responded, “he works with us.” During the call with the woman, multiple shots can be heard as she sheltered in the closet. First responders can be heard making contact with the woman after the shooting ceased. ##911 Audio## A worker of Old National Bank witnessed the shooting while participating in a video meeting on Monday morning and called 911 after seeing the gunman walk into the meeting room. “There’s an active shooter there,” the caller said in a 911 call that was released on Wednesday. The woman said she works at a different branch of the bank. The woman was in distress, yelling and crying as she described to the dispatcher what she saw. “I see somebody on the floor and we heard multiple shots and everyone started saying ‘Oh my god’ and then he came into the board meeting,” she added.  ##911 Audio##  The Louisville Metropolitan Police Department (LMPD) clarified Wednesday that there ""was no discussion about [the shooter] being terminated, and of course he wasn't fired,"" from his bank job prior to Monday's fatal workplace shooting. “He was an active employee there at Old National Bank, but there was no discussion about this individual being terminated,” LMPD Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel told CNN.  The mother of the shooter who killed five people at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday called 911 after hearing secondhand that her son had a gun and was heading toward the bank. The mother made the call at 8:41 a.m. local time, three minutes after the first 911 call came in about the shooting. The mom said she was receiving details secondhand from the shooter’s roommate, who called her.  ""I don’t know anything,"" she said in clear distress. ""But we don’t even own guns; I don’t know where he would have gotten a gun.""  ""I know he doesn’t own any guns,"" she told the operator.  She told the operator multiple times that her son is not violent. “He’s never hurt anyone; he’s a really good kid. Please don’t punish him,” she said to the operator.  “He’s nonviolent; he’s never done anything,” she said later in the call. The mother asked the operator what she should do and if she should go to the bank. The operator told the mother that she has already received multiple calls to Old National Bank. ""You’ve had calls from other people? So he’s already there?"" she asked. 
            “Yes,” the operator said. 
            “I am advising you not to go to the location because it is [an] unsafe location and officers are already at the location, ma’am,” the operator said.  The mother thanked the phone operator and said goodbye. Police said in a news briefing Tuesday that the shooter used an AR-15-style rifle – the choice weapon of many US mass shooters – that he’d legally bought six days before the attack. ##911 Audio## The 911 calls from the Old National Bank mass shooting have been released by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD).  LMPD has released six clips of calls to 911 from the shooting and one clip of LMPD radio traffic. The clips range from 50 seconds to roughly 32 minutes long.  CNN is looking through the calls and will provide the latest updates.  ##911 Audio## Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead. During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was ""neutralized"" approximately three minutes after police responded. ""It's about a nine-minute span from the time he begins his assault,"" Cromwell said. ""And then there's a few minutes after that, before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that, when we respond to the scene. And then about three minutes after, we respond, the subject is neutralized."" Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.  Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a ""targeted"" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police. How it unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman was killed in a shootout with officers, police said. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report. ##Catch Up##  Officials are expected to release audio of 911 calls Wednesday about the shooting, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. It was among more than 145 shootings reported in the US this year with at least four victims, excluding a gunman. Police have already released dramatic police body camera footage of Monday’s shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say the bank employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The attacker, livestreaming the gruesome assault, fatally shot five of his coworkers in Kentucky’s most populous city around 8:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before the bank was to open, authorities said. Several others were hospitalized, including a rookie police officer who was shot in the head and was in critical condition Tuesday. “Our city is heartbroken,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. “These five victims should not be dead – just like everyone else who was killed by gun violence in our city, in our country, should not be dead.” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that at least 40 people have been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. ""This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. You may think this will never happen to you, never happen to any of your friends or loved ones. I used to think that. The sad truth is that now no one in our city, no one in our state, no one in our country has that luxury anymore,"" he continued. Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence. ""Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how we reduce gun violence in our city,"" he said. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for congressional Republicans to pass gun reform policies, saying that the issue is not political. ""We need policies in place that will keep this from happening again so that thoughts and prayers do not have to be offered to get another community ripped apart by the savage violence coming from guns,"" McGarvey said in a Tuesday briefing. ""I had somebody tell me the other day, 'don't make this political.' Fine. Don't make this political. People's lives aren't political. Public safety isn't political. Put those policies in place that put people first. People over guns, kids over guns, public safety over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem,"" McGarvey added. McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove firearms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in a bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks. A 26-year-old rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago – was hospitalized after being shot in the head while responding to a mass shooting Monday at a downtown bank that left five people dead and others injured, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Officer Nickolas Wilt underwent brain surgery after being struck during a shootout in the bank that left the gunman dead, Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department, said Monday afternoon during a news conference. The officer was still in critical condition Tuesday afternoon. “They have him sedated. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It’s just a wait and see,” LaGrange Fire Chief Jim Sitzler told CNN. Wilt is a volunteer firefighter with the department, Sitzler said. Wilt was new to the police department, having graduated from the police academy on March 31, according to the fire chief. Read more about Officer Wilt here. Five people were killed after a workplace shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday morning. The city is set to honor the victims in a vigil Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET.  Here’s what we know so far about the lives lost: Joshua Barrick, 40, and his family were members of the Holy Trinity Parish Louisville, the church wrote on Facebook. ""Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,"" they wrote. ""Please keep the entire Barrick family in your prayers, including his wife, Jessica, and their two sweet children, who are students in our school."" Deana Eckert, 57, was one of the hospitalized victims who later died Monday, police announced. It’s unclear if she was among the three people in critical condition earlier in the day. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg described Eckert as a ""very kind and a very thoughtful person."" Tommy Elliott, Old National Bank senior vice president, is remembered by local and state leaders as a close mentor and beloved community leader. ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" state Sen. David Yates told CNN. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up."" Elliott, 63, was also close friends with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott’s wife. ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and also called the others who were killed ""amazing people"" who will be missed and mourned by their communities. Juliana Farmer, 45, was also an employee of the bank who had just started a new chapter in her life by moving to Louisville from Henderson, her aunt Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WFIE. It had only been her third week on the job, according to Brooks-Scott. She last talked to her niece on Easter. ""She loved life,"" Brooks-Scott said. ""She was a beautiful young lady. All I can say is that heaven has gained a beautiful angel."" Farmer leaves behind three children, four grandchildren, and a fifth due in September, according to her aunt. James ""Jim"" Tutt, 64, was a ""huge fan and supporter"" of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN. Tutt worked as the CRE market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, according to his LinkedIn. He was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization, since 2018 and recently served as its treasurer. CNN’s Caroll Alvarado, Celina Tebor, Elizabeth Wolfe, Laura Ly, John Miller and Holly Yan contributed to this report. A 25-year-old man in Kentucky legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership. Six days later he used that weapon to kill five of his colleagues at a downtown bank, Louisville Metro Police said Tuesday. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. Gun enthusiasts have described it as “one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi.” By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state’s laws as “among the worst in the country.” Kentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. “Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there’s no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they’re ever used in a crime,” CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said. “Red flag” laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out. If the Louisville mass shooter’s behavior “had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,” she said. Prior to 2019 – when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit – individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. “They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,” Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there’s no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over.

The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage Tuesday showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory ""CJ"" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.
            Officer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since Wilt was new to the force, he was acting based on ""his training and his character"" and that he ""never hesitates."" Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said.
            What happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them ""trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,"" Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.
            Bystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. Viewers can see an officer outside the bank.
            Before police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. ##Catch Up##  The family of the gunman who killed five people Monday in a bank shooting in Louisville, Kentucky, told CNN affiliate WDRB that they knew the 25-year-old struggled with depression, but saw no signs he was planning or capable of such violence. In a statement obtained by WDRB on Tuesday night, the family said that ""while Connor, like many of his contemporaries, had mental health challenges which we, as a family, were actively addressing, there were never any warning signs or indications he was capable of this shocking act.""  ""While we have many unanswered questions, we will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials and do all we can to aid everyone in understanding why and how this happened,"" according to the statement.  The family also praised police and expressed sadness for the victims of their son's actions.  ""No words can express our sorrow, anguish, and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people, their families, and the entire Louisville community,"" according to his family. ""We mourn their loss and that of our son, Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized by his senseless acts of violence and are deeply grateful for the bravery and heroism of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department."" This is what it means to serve and protect in a nation awash in guns. Harrowing, yet humbling, body camera footage of two Louisville officers who rushed into gunfire in Kentucky on Monday shows the demands placed upon police who respond to America's proliferating mass shootings and the terrible price they may pay. Video of what is effectively a street battle more akin to a foreign war zone than a US city basking in the morning sunshine offers a visceral antidote to the collective national shoulder shrug that often follows gun massacres. This is a raw, frightening scene, laced with courage and heroism. It offers a reality check about what unfolds in moments of terror and leaves the regular post-massacre political rituals of ""thoughts and prayers"" and doomed calls for gun reform looking empty by comparison. Some might question the need for Americans to see this disturbing footage. But it offers context to the bitter and often futile public debate about how to stop mass shootings and helps the public understand the horror they involve.  Here's what the footage shows: The breathtaking video shows rookie Officer Nickolas Wilt driving up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. After they take fire coming from inside the bank, Wilt slams the car into reverse before getting out with his handgun. Galloway races to the trunk to retrieve his service rifle. Then, without hesitating, they both advance up a set of steps — despite having no idea where the shooter, who turned out to be lying in wait, actually was. Suddenly, Galloway is down on the ground, with a minor gunshot wound after a deafening burst of fire. Wilt, who is blurred in the footage, lies shot in the head — another victim of the weapons of war that are often the preferred choice of mass killers. He is a good guy with a gun who was outgunned by a bad guy with a more powerful weapon. Galloway scrambles for some cover, and then is heard talking to other officers as they try to get a fix on the shooter's position — behind the glare of glass that means he can see them but they can't see him. Galloway, focused and in command, strategizes on how to challenge the shooter again and how to aid the fallen Wilt. Acting quickly is critical. And in a volley of shots, the shooter makes a fatal error, breaking a window in the bank, where four victims already lay dead and one mortally wounded. This gives Galloway a sightline. He shoots and yells, ""I think he's down ... get the officer!"" referring to Wilt, his trainee, who was shot on only his fourth time out on patrol. He's in the hospital in critical condition. ""What you saw in that video was absolutely amazing. It's tragic but it's absolutely amazing,"" Deputy Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey said, when he released the video. ""There's only a few people in this country that can do what they did. Not everybody can do that."" Read the full analysis here.",0
285,US prosecutors tell family of Shanquella Robinson they won't pursue charges in her death in Mexico,"Federal prosecutors told the family of Shanquella Robinson on Wednesday that the evidence they have isn't enough for prosecution in Robinson's death last year in Mexico, the US Attorneys' Offices for the Middle and Western Districts of North Carolina said.  Robinson, a 25-year-old former student at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina, died in October while staying in a luxury rental property in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur.  ""Based on the results of the autopsy and after a careful deliberation and review of the investigative materials by both U.S. Attorneys' Offices, federal prosecutors informed Ms. Robinson's family today that the available evidence does not support a federal prosecution,"" the US Attorneys' Offices said in a release Wednesday. Family members are ""very deeply disappointed"" in the decision, but are ""not deterred"" and plan to continue to seek justice for Robinson, their attorney, Sue-Ann Robinson, said at a news conference.  ""Black and brown people always have to carve their own path to justice,"" attorney Robinson said. Shanquella Robinson was a Black American from North Carolina.  A copy of Shanquella Robinson's death certificate, obtained by CNN affiliate WBTV, listed the cause of death as ""severe spinal cord injury and atlas luxation,"" which is instability or excessive movement in the uppermost neck vertebrae. The document stated she was found unconscious in the living room of the rental residence on October 29. The death certificate classified Shanquella Robinson's death as ""accidental or violent,"" noting that the approximate time between injury and death was 15 minutes. Video posted online appeared to show a physical altercation inside a room between Shanquella Robinson and another person. It's not clear when the video was taken or if the video depicted the moment she suffered the fatal injury. At the time, Bernard Robinson confirmed to CNN it is his daughter seen in the video being thrown to the floor and beaten on the head. It's unclear what led to the altercation or how many people were in the room at the time. It's also unclear if anyone tried to intervene. The FBI conducted ""a detailed and thorough investigation of the evidence"" and worked with the Robinson family to conduct an autopsy in the United States by the Medical Examiner's Office in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the release said.  Federal officials met with the Robinson family and representatives on Wednesday ""to offer their condolences and present the findings of the federal investigation,"" the release said. According to attorney Robinson, the family was told that the FBI interviewed Shanquella Robinson's travel mates and ""people who were in the house,"" but did not specify how many people they interviewed. The US officials told the family that the autopsy, which was completed after Shanquella Robinson's body had been embalmed and transported back to the US, revealed no spinal cord injury but did show swelling on her brain, although the cause of death is still said to be undetermined, the attorney said.  The attorney criticized what she considered a delay on the part of US investigating agencies, saying they waited to investigate until after their own autopsy was conducted.  ""There was no swift action on this case. There was absolutely no urgency on the part of the US authorities,"" Sue-Ann Robinson added. ""If you wait 'till five months after someone committed a crime... they would have the opportunity and time and space to delete text messages if that's what they wanted to do, to talk to each other about the case,"" the attorney said. Federal officials said they do not normally issue public statements about the status of an investigation, but in this case, they felt it was necessary because of the public concern surrounding the case.  ""It is important to reassure the public that experienced federal agents and seasoned prosecutors extensively reviewed the available evidence and have concluded that federal charges cannot be pursued,"" the statement said. Prosecutors in Mexico said last year they were investigating Robinson's death as femicide, a crime defined as the ""intentional murder of women because they are women.""  In most countries, including the United States, femicide is not different from homicide in criminal law, but Mexico is among at least 16 countries that have included femicide as a specific crime. The family plans to hold a march to the State Department headquarters Washington, DC, on May 19, the 200th day since Shanquella Robinson's passing, according to the family's attorney. ""The message cannot be that US citizens can go overseas and commit crimes against other US citizens and come back and say that they're on base, that they're safe, that they're not gonna be arrested, that there's gonna to be such a delay in the investigation that the evidence will have time to dissipate,"" she said.",0
286,"13-year-old leads California police on chase in stolen car and crashes, leaving 2 dead and nearly a dozen injured","Two people were killed and nearly a dozen more were injured after a 13-year-old crashed into two other vehicles while leading police on a chase in a stolen car in California over the weekend, authorities said. One person died at the scene and a 4-year-old girl died Wednesday from her injuries, the Woodland Police Department said. An officer had spotted a vehicle being driven erratically on Saturday afternoon, according to a news release from the police department. Woodland is about 15 miles northwest of Sacramento. The officer tried to pull the vehicle over and a pursuit followed, Woodland police said. The car then collided with two other vehicles, causing two cars to catch fire. Police later determined the driver of the car involved in the pursuit was a 13-year-old boy in a stolen car. He was due to make his first court appearance Wednesday, police said. The 4-year-old who died had been one of 11 people injured in the crash, police said. The California Highway Patrol was investigating, police said.",0
287,Analysis: 'Tone deaf' Macron faces backlash over Taiwan comments,"French President Emmanuel Macron might have hoped to focus this week on what may prove the biggest domestic test of his leadership, as France's Constitutional Council prepares to rule Friday on whether or not he can push ahead with controversial pension reforms.  Instead, he finds himself grappling with international blowback from last week's friendly visit to China -- and in particular from comments that have made him rather unpopular both in Washington DC and with some of his allies in Europe. On his flight home from Beijing, Macron gave an interview to POLITICO Europe. In it, he said that Europe must not become ""just America's followers"" when asked about the prospect of China invading Taiwan. ""The question Europeans need to answer ... is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No. The worse thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the US agenda and a Chinese overreaction,"" Macron said, adding that Europe must not get ""caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy."" Strategic autonomy is a Brussels term that refers to the EU having an independent geopolitical policy, which relies in part on the bloc being able to become a third power and not get squashed between the US and China. However, the China hawks, typically in Eastern Europe, have always been skeptical of anything that puts clear water between Europe and the US, who they see as the ultimate protectors of European territory through NATO. Macron has since attempted to downplay his comments, saying on Wednesday that France was ""for the status quo in Taiwan"" and that position ""has not changed."" But the hawks have already hit back. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: ""Instead of building strategic autonomy from the United States, I propose a strategic partnership with the United States."" Lithuania's foreign minister tweeted ""We are capable of defending Europe without Chinese help. Instead of requesting assistance we should be projecting our strengths."" Eastern European diplomats have been less subtle. One said that Macron is ""simply tone deaf to everything happening in the world. No wonder Macroning has become a synonym of bullshitting without any result."" Another said they ""cannot understand"" Macron, that his visit to Beijing and remarks on Taiwan were ""not helpful"" and that Europe should engage with countries that ""value democracy and the rule of law"" over China.  Macron's trip was further undermined when Beijing performed military rehearses encircling Taiwan the day after he left China.  Risks to US ties European diplomats and officials say that while Macron doesn't speak for Europe and that the 27 EU member states have all agreed on an approach to China, they are aware that his comments -- and, they believe, attempts to present himself as the EU's leader -- could cause Europe real problems with the US,  particularly in terms of European security.  And they'd be correct. Multiple US government sources told CNN that while they are aware that Macron indeed doesn't speak for all of Europe, they are concerned that his words make it much harder to make the case for a strong transatlantic alliance to lawmakers in DC.  Case in point: Florida Senator Marco Rubio posted on Twitter shortly after Macron's comments were published, suggesting that if Macron ""speaks for Europe"" then maybe the US should focus on its objectives and let ""you guys handle Ukraine and Europe."" The US government sources said Macron's comments would only add to the skepticism some Republican lawmakers have about open-ended financial support to Ukraine, and fear the remarks could even contribute to a decision to block or curtail such funding. Worse, the sources also fear it could disrupt NATO unity -- which has been remarkably strong  since the start of the Ukraine crisis -- if countries start unilaterally undermining the priorities of others. A European government official who was at NATO headquarters for a meeting last week said there was broad agreement among the allies, including France, that Taiwan and security in the Indo-Pacific region was of crucial importance to the alliance. They were surprised to see Macron's comments so soon after that meeting.  For all that Macron's comments could be put down to a president under pressure at home doing things on the world stage to create a distraction, his comments on Taiwan have done real damage to the fragile transatlantic relationship.  It might not have been his intention, but Macron's comments have come at a yet unknown cost. And meanwhile, at home, he still faces a serious political crisis. His proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, which was pushed through parliament without a vote, caused violent protests and nationwide strikes.  The reforms include other cost-cutting measures and are, Macron's government says, essential in preventing the pension system from collapsing. Social reforms like this were central to his 2022 re-election campaign. If they are blocked by the Constitutional Council, it will be a huge embarrassment for Macron.  ""Even if he gets his way, even if he sacks his prime minister, Macron has taken a huge political hit and it's hard to see how there won't be even more protests,"" says Aurelien Mondon, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Bath. ""He has always wanted to lead as the all-powerful, sole leader of France. Whatever goes wrong, it's on him.""",0
288,The convicted murderer suspected of faking his own death in a South African prison fire,"If this were the plot of a movie, it would be too far-fetched to be believable. South African authorities have taken over management of a maximum-security prison run by a private British security firm after a high-profile convicted murderer was accused of faking his own death in a fire, then escaping the prison to live in the open with his celebrity doctor girlfriend.   Thabo Bester was deported to South Africa by Tanzanian authorities on Thursday after being arrested in the border town of Arusha, having apparently fled the country, according to a media briefing by the South African Justice Minister and Minister of Police. This comes as media reports raised questions about the prison fire where he was said to have died.   It's a bizarre story that has embarrassed South Africa, exposed alleged loopholes in the management of a private prison and captivated the nation with every blockbuster revelation.   The 35-year-old convicted murderer was arrested with his girlfriend Dr. Nandipha Magudumana and a Mozambican national named as Zakaria Alberto on Friday. South African police minister Bheki Cele told reporters that the trio had several passports each that had not been stamped and were just 10 kilometers from crossing into Kenya.   Bester was sent to the Kgosi Mampuru Central Maximum prison in Pretoria where he will be closely watched. ""We are placing a 24-7 surveillance on him. We're also placing a 24-7 contact with him with selected highly trained Correctional Services officials to ensure that whatever circumstances he finds himself in, we'll be on call, and we do not experience any security breach,"" South Africa's Department of Correctional Services (DCS) boss Makgothi Thobakgale told reporters in Cape Town. Magudumana was also deported to Tanzania and named as an accomplice. She was arrested pending a court appearance on Thursday, according to the Police, and will be charged with murder, fraud as well as aiding and abetting his escape. Magudumana's 65-year-old father Zolile Cornelius Sekeleni and a former prison warden, Senohe Ishmael Matsoara, 38, were also arrested and accused of being accomplices in Bester's escape. The two men were charged with ""defeating the ends of justice, fraud, murder, and arson,"" in a Bloemfontein court on Tuesday. They did not enter a plea and have no lawyers on record. A judge ordered them to remain in custody until their next court date on April 17.  'A well-calculated and organized escape debacle' Bester was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the rape and murder of model Nomfundo Tyhulu. A court had previously found him guilty of the rape and robbery of two other women he lured to his home on social media, with local media dubbing him ""the Facebook rapist."" He was initially reported to have died in a fire at the prison last May. But in November, the official position by South African prison authorities that Bester had been found dead in his cell began to unravel after local investigative outlet GroundUp's reporting raised doubts. Authorities later concluded that the burned body found in his cell was not Bester, and the person had died before the fire began.  ""A case of murder is under investigation following the outcome of the DNA analysis that confirmed that the body of the deceased which was found [in the cell], was not of Thabo Bester,"" police and the Justice & Correctional Services ministry said in a joint statement on Saturday.  ""The autopsy report went on to further reveal that the deceased had died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, and was already dead, prior to the arson incident,"" it added. The DCS last month said Bester appeared to have walked out of the facility in ""a well calculated and organised escape debacle."" It temporarily took over the management of the prison from the British company G4S, and suspended three of its own officials.  ""Greatly worrying is the fact that a private vehicle was allowed inside the facility without a gate pass on the day of the escape, possibly carrying an unknown body that was burnt beyond recognition in cell 35. This talks to a facility that has compromised its security system beyond any reasonable doubt,"" the DCS said in a statement last month. Three G4S officials were pressed by lawmakers on Wednesday to explain how Bester escaped from a maximum security prison they had described as ""one of the most secure in South Africa."" Though they deny any wrongdoing, they say three employees who were on duty have been dismissed and seven more remain suspended. A 22-page report presented alongside the G4S officials' appearance before the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services said an unauthorized phone and laptop were recovered in Bester's cell after the fire. Bester's application to be moved to solitary confinement because ""his life was in danger"" had been approved just three days before he escaped, they said. But many lawmakers were not satisfied, accusing the firm of dishonesty and failing to take responsibility for the prison break. ""You are a private company in a private public partnership with the state that is dishonest that came and deliberately misled the people's parliament. What would be your reaction to that?"" asked ruling party MP Xola Ngola. ""I would disagree with that,"" responded Cobus Groenewoud, a director at G4S. ""We have tabled to the committee all the facts available to us."" They told the committee that there was no security camera footage of the cell on the night of Bester's escape due to a power failure. They admitted in questioning that the cell is located near an emergency exit and did not rule out staff collusion in the prison break. Bester's girlfriend Magudumana is a prominent medical doctor and entrepreneur, with more than 100,000 followers on social media where she posted glamorous pictures, promoted her media appearances, and boasted of awards such as the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans of 2018.   Andre Snyman, a crime analyst who founded the South African community crime network eblockwatch and describes himself as ""the agony aunty of crime in South Africa,"" told CNN that he met Bester several years ago and described him as charismatic.  ""He was an incredibly neat, well-groomed, well-spoken and well-dressed man."" He doesn't expect Bester to escape a second time though. ""He's South Africa's Houdini but I don't think he'll get out again.""",0
289,Japan's population drops by half a million in 2022,"Japan's population has fallen for the 12th consecutive year, as deaths rise and the birth rate continues to sink, according to government data released Wednesday. The population stood at 124.49 million in 2022 -- representing a decline of 556,000 from the previous year, figures show. That figure represents both the natural change in population -- meaning deaths and births -- and the flow of people entering and exiting the country. The natural change last year was the biggest on record, with a fall of 731,000 -- cushioned by the influx of people entering Japan, which provided an increase of 175,000, said Cabinet Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno in a news conference on Wednesday. ""It is essential to take firm measures to address the declining birthrate, which is a major factor in the decline in population, as one of the top priority issues to be addressed,"" said Matsuno. Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, as well as one of the highest life expectancies; in 2020, nearly one in 1,500 people in Japan were age 100 or older, according to government data. That means a swelling elderly population, shrinking workforce, and not enough young people to fill in the gaps -- posing a demographic crisis decades in the making. The trend is seen across the country, with all of Japan's 47 prefectures except Tokyo reporting a decline in residents last year, according to the data released Wednesday. One village in central Japan recorded just one newborn child in 25 years -- a birth that was heralded as a miracle for the town's elderly residents. The situation is so dire that Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned lawmakers in January that the country is ""on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions"" due to the falling birth rate.  He added that child-rearing support was the government's ""most important policy,"" and solving the issue ""simply cannot wait any longer."" Trouble ahead Some researchers and climate scientists argue that population decline could benefit our battered ecosystems and lower emissions as the climate crisis worsens. But it also spells trouble for countries like Japan, with fewer workers to fund pensions and healthcare, and fewer people to look after the elderly. In April, Japan launched its new Children and Families Agency, which focuses on measures to support parents such as establishing more daycare centers, and provides youth services such as counseling. Previous similar initiatives, often carried out by local authorities, have so far failed to turn things around. Busy urban lifestyles and long working hours leave little time for some Japanese to start families, and the rising costs of living that mean having a baby is simply too expensive for many young people.  In 2022, Japan was ranked one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child, according to research from financial institution Jefferies. And yet, the country's economy has stalled since the early 1990s, meaning frustratingly low wages and little upward mobility. The drop in the number of Japanese nationals in the past year also highlights the government's deeply conservative views on immigration. Foreigners accounted for just 2.2% of the population in 2021, according to the Japanese government, compared to 13.6% in the United States.  These attitudes are widespread among the public, too; a 2021 study by the Pew Research Center found that about half of Japanese adults say having a diverse society makes their country a worse place to live -- though this percentage is lower than in previous years.",0

291,"The banking crisis will tilt US into recession, say Fed economists","The fallout from the recent banking crisis is likely to push the US economy into a mild recession later this year, according to notes from the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting, released on Wednesday.  Since November 2022, staff economists at the Federal Reserve have predicted subdued growth and a weakening economy during policy decision meetings. in March, they said the banking crisis heightened that forecast to a recession.  Taking into account ""the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments,"" Fed economists' ""projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year,"" noted minutes from the Fed's most recent two-day monetary policy meeting on March 21-22.  This is the first time in the current hiking cycle that staff economists have forecast such a recession.  ""The main takeaway from Wednesday's Federal Reserve minutes is that the central bank anticipates a mild recession in late 2023 and that the soft landing window seems to be closing quickly,"" said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management, in a note Wednesday.  Policymakers at the Fed voted unanimously last month for a smaller interest rate increase after turbulence in the banking industry set off fears of bank runs, according to the minutes. The notes, released on Wednesday afternoon, highlighted the uncertainty behind the decision, which came just days after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Fed officials raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point, the ninth-rate hike in a row. ""Some participants noted that given persistently high inflation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a [half percentage point] increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector,"" according to the minutes. Given those projections and their own economic uncertainty, policymakers judged it ""prudent to increase the target range by a smaller increment at this meeting."" Policymakers also noted that actions taken by the Fed and other government agencies to mitigate possible contagion and secure the US financial system had successfully quelled immediate fears and and calmed conditions in the banking sector. Because of that, they said, they thought it was appropriate to address strong economic data and sticky inflation rates by raising rates by a quarter point instead of pausing all together. The Fed's latest interest rate increase brought the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, the highest level since September 2007. But the banking stress, coupled with slowing inflation and a cooling labor market, could signal the imminent end of the Fed's rate-hiking campaign. The Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched inflation gauge, rose 5% in March from a year earlier, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That marks the ninth-straight month that headline inflation has slowed. While bank failures can erode confidence in the banking industry, they can make borrowing harder, which can also curb spending and ease some pressure on prices and the labor market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference following the conclusion of the March policymaking meeting. ""Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening,"" Powell said, stressing that the banking industry remained sound. The meeting minutes echoed that sentiment. Recent developments in the banking sector, they said, ""were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,"" though policymakers were unsure of the extent of the economic fallout. ""Participants agreed that the extent of these effects was uncertain,"" said the notes. SVB's collapse was the second-largest bank failure in US history and underpins the worst banking crisis since the Great Recession. The bank, which had over $200 billion in total assets at the end of last year, primarily provided banking services to venture-backed technology companies. The turbulence in the technology industry meant many customers were burning through cash and taking out their money at a faster pace. In early March, SVB sought to raise capital from investors and announced that it had sold some securities at a loss and would sell $2.25 billion in new shares to plug the hole in its finances. Customers panicked, attempted to withdraw close to $100 billion from the bank, and regulators took over a few days later. Signature Bank was the other casualty of the US banking industry's turmoil last month and, later, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, which was forced to merge with its longtime rival UBS as a remedy. The Fed now has to balance taming still-high inflation, ensuring financial stability and factoring in other economic shocks, like the recent surprise decision from OPEC+ to cut global oil production. Meanwhile, congressional lawmakers such as Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren have called for investigations into the bank failures and legislating additional rules such as raising the FDIC insurance limit for deposits.",0
292,FBI warns consumers not to use public phone charging stations,"The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software.  Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to a tweet last week from the FBI's Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples.  ""Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,"" the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term ""juice jacking"" to describe the problem. ""Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,"" Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8, explained to CNN in 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer.  If a port is compromised, there's no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts.  ""The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,"" Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI's Denver branch, told CNN. ""This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling."" The Federal Communications Commission also updated a blog post on Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords.  ""In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,"" according to the FCC blog post. ""There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.""",0
293,Warren Buffett wants harsher penalties for top leaders of failed banks,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett isn't worried about the state of the US banking industry — but he would like to see much tougher consequences for top leaders of the banks that fail. In the wake of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett reflected on the public's frustration after the 2008 financial crisis. ""All kinds of trouble [was] caused by the banks. But bank executives ... they all continue to live fine. They may have lost their job, but they got their pensions,"" he said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC. ""There have got to be consequences to the people who make the decisions. Penalizing the shareholders later on by billions of dollars worth of fines ... that doesn't deter the bad action."" Specifically, Buffett thinks presidents and CEOs of failed banks should lose their retirement savings and that directors should have to return five years' worth of their lucrative salaries.  He admitted neither is likely to happen. ""That will not be met by great enthusiasm from a lot of friends of mine,"" he said. ""I don't know anybody that went back to flipping burgers at McDonald's or something, after they screwed up the system in a big way in 2008 and '09."" Still, he agrees with a number of banking experts who say the problems exposed over the last month following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank are nowhere near as bad as the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett also noted that customers of SVB and Signature Bank — a New York bank that failed shortly after SVB — don't have to worry about losing their money because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has guaranteed all deposits for those two banks — even those above the normal $250,000 limit. The FDIC's move was an extraordinary one, and Buffett said it gives him confidence about the state of the industry. It will be the banks, not US taxpayers, who will have to pay if the costs of bank failures rise, he added. Berkshire's bank sell-off The lack of penalties for bank leaders is one reason Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off most of its bank stocks, including some the company held for 30 years, he said. ""I just think the system isn't quite right in terms of connecting punishment to culprits on something that is so important,"" he said. Stiffer penalties would also help bolster both investors' and bank customers' confidence in the banking system, Buffett said, noting that ""there is no penalty attached to bad behavior and it does really, really affect the system when people lose confidence in banks."" As the fall of SVB showed, that confidence can be lost ""in seconds,"" Buffett said. ""We saw a country that was not worried about banks until about Wednesday or Thursday of the week when Silicon Valley [collapsed], and all of a sudden everybody was all worried about it [the banking system] all over the country."" Yet thanks to the FDIC, Buffett said, depositors don't need to worry. In fact, he said he would bet $1 million that no US bank depositors will lose money over the next year and invited someone else to put up $1 million that there will be losses — with the winner determining which charity would get the $2 million at the end of the year. Buffett also weighed in about the blame some place on Federal Reserve for the current banking crisis. Critics have slammed the lack of bank oversight and say the Fed raised interest rates so quickly that the Treasuries held by banks lost more value than banks expected. But Buffett has only praise for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. ""I do not think I could run the Fed as well as Jay Powell has done,"" Buffett said. ""He's been terrific.""",0
294,"Memphis leaders pass measure that ends police stops for minor infractions, three months after Tyre Nichols' death","The Memphis City Council on Tuesday passed an ordinance that puts an end to pretextual police stops. The ""Driving Equality Act in Honor of Tyre Nichols,"" named after the 29-year-old Black man who was beaten to death by Memphis officers during a traffic stop, was passed unanimously and will become the practice on Memphis streets. Pretext stops allow police to use minor traffic infractions or broken taillights as grounds to investigate motorists for more serious crimes. Police have defended those kinds of stops, saying they are crucial for fighting possession of illegal drugs, weapons possession, human trafficking and drunken driving.  But civil rights groups say the tactic unfairly targets Black drivers.  The measure passed in Memphis will still allow police to make traffic stops for primary violations -- like aggressive driving -- but pulling someone over for secondary violations or minor infractions -- like a loose bumper or a broken taillight -- will no longer be allowed.  The end of these kinds of stops has been on the list of police reforms that activists had called for since Nichols' death.  Nichols was brutally beaten by city officers on the night of January 7. He required hospitalization after the encounter and died on January 10. 'This is a start for getting justice' Councilwoman Michalyn Easter-Thomas, the sponsor of the ordinance, told CNN affiliate WMC the measure will allow authorities to focus their resources on where they are needed.  ""What this ordinance is not saying, is do not go to those aggressive drivers,"" Easter-Thomas told the affiliate. ""It's not saying we're not looking for counterfeit tags. It's diverting our resources to where we need the most, which is for (the Memphis Police Department) to fight crime for us and for them to be in their communities being supportive and engaging so that we can build our positive decorum between our officers and our community members."" ""We are so pleased,"" Rev. Ayanna Watkins, Executive Director of Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope told CNN by phone. ""This is a start for getting justice for Tyre and all of those unnamed who died in a similar way."" ""It's also a way of being heard,"" Watkins added. ""Our elected officials are there to hear the people and serve the people."" Residents voiced concern about 'pretext stops' A month before Nichols' death, activists and organizers gave a presentation at the city council's public safety committee hearing to highlight their concerns about violent pretextual traffic stops in Memphis they said led to the death or injury of five people since 2013, video from the committee hearing showed. Activists with Decarcerate Memphis made their presentation on December 6, almost exactly one month to the day before Nichols was brutally beaten by members of the now-disbanded SCORPION unit. There was no specific reference to the SCORPION unit during the presentation, a CNN review found. Another measure was tabled Another public safety ordinance was tabled on Tuesday over concerns about community input.  ""It practically cut and pasted policies out of the police and policy handbook,"" Watkins said about the tabled ordinance. ""It would have taken the teeth out of the previous ordinances that were passed like the data transparency ordinance."" The data transparency ordinance, part of a handful of police reforms passed after Nichols' death, allows the public to see who was pulled over, when they were stopped and for what and what the outcomes were, Watkins said. Regular reporting will require ""data regarding traffic stops, arrests, use of force, and complaints,"" according to the ordinance.  In March, the city council passed five public safety ordinances, including requiring an independent review of the department's police academy and barring the use of unmarked vehicles during traffic stops.",0

298,Vietnam sentences political activist to 6 years in prison for anti-state activities,"A Hanoi court on Wednesday sentenced a prominent Vietnamese political activist to six years in prison for conducting anti-state activities, his lawyer said, in a case that has raised international concerns over the communist country's treatment of dissidents. Nguyen Lan Thang, 48, participated in environmental and anti-China protests, voiced support for other jailed activists, and wrote blogs about Vietnam's sociopolitical issues, according to his social media accounts. The police said last year they arrested Thang on charges of ""making, storing or distributing information, materials, documents to oppose the state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,"" without providing further details. Thang will also be placed under house arrest for two years after he serves his sentence, said his lawyer Le Van Luan after the closed-door trial session at the People's Court of Hanoi. Calls to the court went unanswered on Wednesday. Authorities have convicted at least 163 people since 2018 for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or association under ""vague or overbroad laws that criminalize protesting or criticizing the government,"" according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). ""Vietnam's authorities systematically trample on human rights by punishing brave bloggers like Nguyen Lan Thang for expressing their views about the government,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at HRW, which called for Thang's release and for charges against him to be dropped. A delegation of the European Parliament's Subcommittee of Human Rights during a visit to Hanoi last week expressed its ""great concern at the worsening human rights situation in the country."" ""The delegation called for immediate and unconditional release of all the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Vietnam, including NGO leaders, journalists and environmental activists,"" it said in a statement.",0
299,"April 12, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news","Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below. There have been more than 77,000 alleged war crimes registered by Ukraine, the country's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin told The Washington Post Wednesday. He said the alleged war crime incidents ""include not only murder, not only humiliation and rape, they also include the destroying of private property. They include forced deportation. They include forced detention of Ukrainians on occupied territories. They include looting on massive scale on the occupied territories and many other war crimes."" The chief prosecutor told the newspaper he has 305 alleged perpetrators ""who are notified of suspicion,"" along with 150 indictments ready and 30 convictions ""by Ukrainian courts with regard to Russian war criminals"" who committed alleged crimes on Ukrainian soil. He added that ""99-plus percent of all cases of war crimes committed against Ukrainians will be prosecuted and tried in Ukraine."" ""We are investigating war crimes in course of ongoing aggression,"" Kostin said to the Washington Post. ""We are not only investigating them, but also, we are making Russians accountable for the war crimes committed on Ukrainian soil."" According to Kostin, there are four elements contributing to the criminal accountability documented throughout the war in Ukraine: National efforts, assistance from the International Criminal Court, international coordination and the creation of a special international tribunal for the alleged ""crime of aggression.""  ""These four layers of criminal responsibility create full web of accountability on (a) criminal level for Russia and its perpetrators,"" Kostin told the Post.  Russia says its forces hit Ukrainian army reserves attempting to get into the battered city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. According to Russia's Ministry of Defense, Russian forces hit ""reserves of the enemy that tried to break into Bakhmut from the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Bohdanivka, as well as the units of the 28th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine close to Kostiantynivka."" On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials denied Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin's claim that Russian forces now control 80% of the city. Here are other headlines: Sanctions: The United Kingdom announced sanctions on a network of companies and individuals with financial links to Russian oligarch and ex-Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, as well as Alisher Usmanov. It said the move would would target those helping the pair to ""avoid the full cost"" of sanctions already imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States also imposed a large tranche of sanctions Wednesday on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to the war.  Beheading video responses: The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali said on Wednesday. The statement is in response to two videos released on social media in the past week that appear to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. Wagner private military company leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has denied that his fighters were involved in the grisly video. Leaked documents: A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. Electronic conscription bill: A new bill allowing for the electronic delivery of military draft papers is meant to fix a chaotic process of registration and enlistment, the Kremlin said Wednesday. The bill is designed to make the process “modern, efficient and convenient for citizens,” spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Russian officials have denied suggestions that the bill lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization. Evan Gershkovich: The US continues its public push for consular access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, as the top official handling hostage negotiation committed to bringing him home from Russia. Access to Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Military aid: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal repeated Ukraine’s requests for F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and longer-range missiles from the US directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in remarks at the top of their meeting at the Pentagon. Shmyhal also thanked the US for its continued military support during their meeting. Also, the Serbian government has denied it sold weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, after a report emerged claiming otherwise. ##Catch Up## Pentagon officials provided an unclassified briefing about the leaked classified information Wednesday afternoon for House leadership, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, according to three congressional sources familiar with the matter.   The 45-minute phone briefing was held by the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Defense and Security Ronald Moultrie, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Rheanne Wirkkala and Under Secretary for Policy Colin Kahl.  It was the first official briefing the lawmakers received on the topic, coming a week after the Defense Department was made aware of the leaked classified documents.  Senate leadership and the relevant Senate national security committees also received a briefing from the Biden administration on the leaked classified documents, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The briefers told the House and Senate committees that the Pentagon is looking for the source of the leak and that the Biden administration is trying to ease the concerns of nervous allies, according to another source familiar with the briefings. One source declined to provide details about what was said but told CNN that members learned very little, and some left the meeting feeling like there was a lack of urgency inside the administration over the leak. All senators will receive a briefing on the leaked documents on Wednesday afternoon next week, according to a Senate Democratic aide. A classified briefing for all House members is also expected next week, possibly on Wednesday, one of the sources said.  The European Union Delegation at the United Nations said those who are committing war crimes in Ukraine must be held accountable after a video appears to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. ""The EU supports investigations on all war crimes committed in Ukraine. We will work tirelessly to ensure accountability,"" the EU said on Twitter Wednesday. Some background: A video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, which appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Russian social media accounts said the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved.  CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. A second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began.   A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. As a NATO member, Turkey is broadly considered a partner nation to the US and other nations providing direct military support to Ukraine and it has publicly expressed opposition to Russia's invasion. It is also home to a major US military base where nuclear weapons are stored and act as an obvious warning sign to deter Russian aggression against NATO members.  Evidence that Turkey has discussed selling weapons to Russian mercenary forces would likely raise serious concerns in Washington and complicate Ankara's relationship with other NATO members. Not only does the document reference intelligence about Wagner seeking to purchase weapons from Turkey, it also states that the paramilitary group planned to resume recruitment of prisoners from Russia's jails.  According to the US signals intelligence reporting cited in the document, personnel from the Wagner Group met with ""Turkish contacts"" in early February with the intent ""to purchase weapons and equipment from Turkey"" that could then be used by Wagner mercenaries who are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Wagner also planned to use the weapons and equipment from Turkey in Mali, where the group maintains a significant presence, according to the leaked document. While there is no evidence that shows that Turkey has moved forward with any arms sales to the Wagner Group, details about the February meeting — outlined in a section of the leaked document titled, ""Mali, Russia, Turkey: Vagner seeks weapons from Ankara"" — suggest US officials believe the Russian mercenary outfit has at least tested the waters.  CNN has not independently confirmed the veracity of the document, but US officials have indicated that most of the leaked tranche are authentic. A State Department spokesperson said the ""the Department of Defense and the intelligence community are actively reviewing and assessing the validity"" of the leaked documents, adding ""we are not in a position to confirm or comment on any specific information they contain."" CNN has reached out to the US National Security Council, the office of the Turkish President and Turkey's Embassy in Washington for comment on the document. Read more here. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has secured a $200 million loan from the World Bank to help rebuild the country’s energy sector. “Today we signed the agreement with World Bank VP Anna Bjerde to provide an additional $200 million to restore power system in #Ukraine,” he tweeted Wednesday, after a meeting in Washington. “We are also preparing to implement a military risk insurance project for foreign investors.”  “Grateful for the support for Ukraine’s recovery,” he added. Shmyhal said Ukraine would begin rebuilding damaged areas this year. “The funds attracted from the World Bank will be used to rebuild the power grid and heat supply systems in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy and the cities of Chernihiv region,” he said, according to his office. “This winter, we have defeated Russia in the battle for light and are already preparing for the next heating season.” Access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. “Regarding the visit of Evan Gershkovich by representatives of the US Embassy in Moscow, we inform you that the issue is being considered and will be worked out in due time in accordance with consular practice and Russian law. The status assigned to him by the American authorities in this case does not matter,” said Zakharova in a statement published by the ministry Wednesday. Zakharova said the ""noise"" staged in the Western media around the detention of a journalist ""caught red-handed"" is ""an example of blatant hypocrisy."" ""It is kept silent that the American embassy in Moscow was notified in a timely manner about the detention of Evan Gershkovich. Our diplomats in similar cases, in violation of the bilateral consular convention, are informed either with a delay or not at all, especially in high-profile cases under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Justice and the FBI,"" she said. According to Zakharova, the calls by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials to its citizens to leave the Russian Federation are ""hypocritical,"" since it was Washington that launched ""the real hunt for Russians in the US and third countries."" “I emphasize that any attempts to put pressure on the Russian authorities and the courts, insisting on a 'special treatment' for US citizens who have broken the Russian law, are senseless and futile. It is time for Washington to learn that we will not tolerate interference in our internal affairs and will act exclusively in accordance with our national interests,"" Zakharova added. Some background: On Monday, the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich’s release. Reporting from CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States for its continued military support as he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Wednesday. ""Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States and the Secretary personally for their significant military support, as well as for their efforts to establish the Contact Group on Ukraine's Defense, which currently includes more than 50 countries,"" his office said in a readout of the meeting.  The pair discussed Ukraine’s further needs, with Shmyhal asking Austin to supply Ukraine with more weapons.  “Ukrainian soldiers have proven that they can master the latest equipment in a short time and use it effectively on the battlefield,” he said, according to his office. “For a quicker victory, Ukraine also needs more weapons: Air defense, heavy artillery and equipment, mortars and ammunition.” Wagner private military company founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin has called for the entire Russian society to be mobilized, saying people are ready to contribute to Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.  ""It is not only the mobilized who should be mobilized, those who go to the front, but all the society should be mobilized,” Prigozhin said in an audio posted on his Telegram channel, in reaction to Russia’s new electronic conscription bill. ""Starting from simple workers who are actually ready for this process."" “When we travel to the regions, our recruiters see that people are ready to be mobilized and understand that there is a war going on for the very existence of Russia,” he added. Unlike Prigozhin, the Russian government continues to deny it is waging a war in Ukraine, referring to the conflict as a ""special military operation."" The new bill put forward by the Kremlin, which is set to be signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, would tighten the rules for Russians drafted into the conflict to prevent them from leaving the country — as many did in droves during last year's ""partial mobilization."" The Wagner leader criticized Russian officials who fled the country with their wealth and said the whole ""system"" needs to be shaken.  ""Why don't we want to clean out this anthill that has been created over the years and which over the years has turned from a community of people who are ready to develop something in this country into a community of people who are only interested in their own well-being?"" he questioned. ""The system requires global sanitation and a reduction in the number of participants in this bureaucratic community."" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal repeated Ukraine’s requests for F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and longer-range missiles from the US directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in remarks at the top of their meeting at the Pentagon. “We will win this war,” said Shmyhal in English, “but to achieve it faster and with fewer casualties, Ukraine still needs intensive military support.” Austin did not comment on the specific requests, but did commit to expanding the production of military assets in the US for Ukraine. “We will keep investing in our own defense industrial base to further ramp up production,” said Austin. Austin also thanked Ukraine for its focus on accountability for the security assistance the US has already provided. “Let me commend you for the unprecedented level of transparency that Ukraine has provided to ensure our security assistance remains in the hands of Ukraine’s defenders,” said Austin. Austin ignored a question about the effect of the leaked classified documents from the Pentagon on Ukraine. More on jets: In March, Slovakia joined fellow NATO member Poland in pledging to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The White House had said that Poland’s decision to send the fighter jets is a ""sovereign decision"" that won’t spur US President Joe Biden to send F-16 aircraft. The United States imposed a large tranche of sanctions on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Wednesday’s sanctions are the latest action meant to diminish Moscow’s abilities in its war in Ukraine and punish those who are supporting it, including through helping Russia to evade existing sanctions. Sanctions on Russian billionaire and associates: The latest sanctions target a wide network tied to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who is already under sanction in multiple countries, and were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom. According to the US Treasury Department, Usmanov ""is one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires"" who ""holds significant interests in the metals and mining, telecommunications, and information technology sectors.""  He is ""known to be close to multiple U.S.-designated, senior Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Dmitry Medvedev, current Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former President and Prime Minister of Russia,"" according to a statement.   Sanctions on international companies and a bank: The US also imposed sanctions on companies based in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, which the US Treasury Department said is supporting Russia’s military industrial complex in defiance of existing sanctions.  The Treasury also sanctioned the International Investment Bank, ""a Russia-controlled financial institution"" in Budapest, as well as its Moscow-based subsidiary and several former and current executives.  ""The IIB’s presence in Budapest enables Russia to increase its intelligence presence in Europe, opens the door for the Kremlin’s malign influence activities in Central Europe and the Western Balkans, and could serve as a mechanism for corruption and illicit finance, including sanctions violations,” according to the Treasury Department.  Sanctions on organizations that target children: In addition, the US State Department is sanctioning two Russian entities ""that support Russia’s efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine through the militarization and indoctrination of schoolchildren: The All Russian Children's And Youth Military Patriotic Public Movement Youth Army, and the State Budgetary Educational Institution of Additional Education of the Republic of Crimea Crimea Patriot Center,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.  According to the State Department, the so-called youth army was created by Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and is ""responsible for militarizing and propagandizing schoolchildren in occupied areas of Ukraine."" 
            The ""Crimea Patriot Center"" is ""an organization whose objective is to provide youth with a ‘military-patriotic education’ in order to prepare them for service in the Russia’s Armed Forces,"" it said.  The Serbian government has denied it sold weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, after a report emerged claiming otherwise.  ""Serbia has not and will not sell weapons to either Ukraine or Russia,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Milos Vucevic said in a statement Wednesday. ""We have rejected those allegations more than ten times, and we will do it again."" Vucevic was responding to a Reuters report that claimed a leaked Pentagon document names Serbia as having sent or is planning to send lethal aid to Ukraine.  ""Someone obviously aims to drag Serbia into that conflict, but we adhere to our policy consistently,"" Vucevic said. ""There is always the possibility that some weapons might mysteriously appear on the territory where there is a conflict, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Serbia. That is a question for the countries that do not conform to international norms or terms of business agreements,"" he added.�� More about the documents: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. The highly classified Pentagon documents have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post.  Ukrainian and Spanish defense ministers have denied claims that NATO troops are fighting against Russian armed forces in Ukraine, refuting allegations that emerged from a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents.  “It is totally false that there are NATO troops in Ukraine,” Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said Wednesday at a joint news conference in Madrid with her visiting Ukrainian counterpart.  “It’s not true that there are NATO personnel in Ukraine,” with the exception of military attachés, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said. Responding to a question about the document leak, Reznikov said it ""has a lot of data that’s not true (and) is no longer current. The beneficiary of this operation is Russia or its allies or sympathizers,"" adding that he is confident that Ukraine’s US allies will work to ""neutralize this leak and avoid this in the future.""  Ukraine has ""full confidence in our in our American allies"" in spite of the leak, he said. From Spain’s perspective, Robles said the unity of NATO and European Union allies remains strong and Russia will ""not achieve a break in that.""  Update on tanks: Robles said Spain’s first shipment of six modern battle tanks for Ukraine will leave soon via ship and should arrive in the war-torn country by the end of this month. Along with these six Leopard 2A4 tanks, Spain will also send 20 armored vehicles, she added. Spain will later send four more of the Leopard tanks ""as soon as possible,"" after they are repaired. Reznikov said Ukraine asked Spain for air defense systems, including combat jets, artillery rounds, and for training and technical advice in amphibious military operations, including undersea mine removal. The Ukrainian defense minister said he would meet with executives of Spanish arms makers on this visit. He and the Spanish defense minister were also expected to tour a military hospital in Madrid treating Ukrainian troops severely wounded in combat, including those whose limbs have been amputated.   Russian officials have denied suggestions that a bill to allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters it is meant only to ""fix the mess"" that followed September’s controversial partial mobilization order, which was beset by issues and prompted thousands of Russians to flee. But the strict new rules make it more difficult for Russian men to avoid an order should it be made, and Russians told CNN of their concerns about the plan. ""Now it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become,"" Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN.  While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to their own guidelines when calling up recruits. ""I have no illusions with regard to the assurances of authorities who insist these amendments were passed exclusively to improve the draft’s bookkeeping and have nothing to do with the second mobilization wave,"" he said. ""I don’t believe a word of this."" ""I believe the mobilization has never ended. It has begun and continues to the day,"" he added. ""You can look at this development as preparation of the state to step up mobilization. To make it possible to notify and mobilize large number of conscripts in a short period of time."" The bill passed through its third reading in the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament Tuesday, and was approved by the upper chamber, the Federation Council on Wednesday. Its final formality is to be signed into law by Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN also spoke to Olga, a 48-year-old woman who fears her son, who is 16, will be sent to fight in the coming years, disrupting his plans for higher education. ""I feel very badly about this war. And same goes for all other wars and any deaths by force regardless of the cause,"" she said. ""I would prefer for wars to be fought only by professional military or volunteers."" “Should (the war) drag on and intensify, and if there is a real second wave of mobilization, then I think some will try to leave (Russia), of course,"" she added.

According to the ministry, Russian forces hit ""reserves of the enemy that tried to break into Bakhmut from the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Bohdanivka, as well as the units of the 28th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine close to Kostiantynivka."" The ministry also said Wagner private military company fighters had captured three more blocks in their attempt to seize control of the embattled city. CNN cannot independently verify these claims.  What Ukraine says: On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials denied Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin's claim that Russian forces now control 80% of the city. ""I've just been in touch with the commander of one of the brigades that are defending the city. I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut,"" Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told CNN on Tuesday. Western officials have conceded Russia had been able to make some progress in Bakhmut, but added it could be ""measured in meters."" Wagner private military company leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has denied that his fighters were involved in a grisly video that purportedly shows Ukrainian soldiers who have been beheaded. “I have watched this video. It’s bad when people’s heads are cut off, but I haven’t found anything to support that this is happening near Bakhmut and that Wagner fighters are participating in the execution,"" he said in a statement published by his company Wednesday. Prigozhin was responding to a question about a video that was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, which appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. A second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Andy Carey, Josh Pennington and Yulia Kesaieva contributed reporting to this post.  The US continues its public push for consular access to Evan Gershkovich as the top official handling hostage negotiation committed to bringing the detained Wall Street Journal reporter home from Russia.  “The Russians owe us a consular visit. We have yet to have consular access to Mr. Gershkovich,” US special envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens told “CNN This Morning.”  Asked if a prisoner swap is on the table, Carstens said that the US is committed to bringing Gershkovich and others who are wrongfully detained home and that US President Joe Biden would do “whatever it takes to get that job done” and is willing to make “hard decisions.” “The President of the United States and the Secretary are committed to bringing Evan home and Paul Whelan as well. And we're gonna find whatever it takes to get that job done. We’re not going into the specifics of the pathways of negotiation. To my mind that might decrease our chances to garner that release, but I can tell you that the President’s shown time and time again that he's committed, he's willing to make the hard decisions to find ways to bring Americans home,” he said.  Now that Gershkovich has been formally designated by the State Department as wrongfully detained, Carstens said it “by force of law obligates the United States of America to seek a wrongfully detained American’s release. And that's what we're doing right now. My office is working closely with the National Security Council at the White House to find those paths that will bring Evan home.”  More on Americans detained in Russia: Carstens said he spoke with Paul Whelan for about 15 minutes on Monday and they spoke “about Evan’s case.” “Paul’s spirits are still good. He's still remaining strong. He's still resilient. Small known fact — I mean, he sings the National Anthem every day from his prison cell, and he's ready to come home and we're going to find a way to bring him home,” he said, adding that his office does not prioritize cases and both Whelan and Gershkovich, along with the 30-40 cases currently being handled by his office are “treated equally.” Carstens noted that there have been conversations between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as well as discussions between US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy and her counterparts. “We've been pressing them for Evan’s release, we've been pressing them for consular access, and anything beyond that I'd rather not talk about. I want to maintain some of our negotiation space,” Carstens said, adding, “We’re going to find a way to bring Evan and Paul Whelan home.” The upper chamber of Russia’s parliament, the Federation Council, has voted in favor of the electronic delivery of military call-up papers, which critics say will make it more difficult for Russians to evade conscription. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Once the bill becomes law, a person will be considered notified even if they have not seen the call-up papers or email. The call-up papers will be deemed to be served once they appear on a government portal called Gosuslugi — the main online platform for state services in Russia, such as making a doctor’s appointment, requesting a passport or registering for marriage.  Previously, conscription documents in Russia had to be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer.  Those liable for military service will be banned from traveling abroad, the proposed legislation published on the government’s website said. Draft dodgers will receive a travel ban from the day when the summons is considered to have been ""handed"" to them, in accordance with the law.  People who fail to show up for a military summons without a valid reason within 20 days will face restrictions, such as being unable to register a vehicle and drive it, being unable to register an apartment, being unable to register as an individual entrepreneur or as self-employed, and be blocked from getting a loan. Paper and electronic summonses will have equal legal force, Andrey Kartapolov, head of the State Duma Committee on Defense, said to the RBC TV channel. According to Kartapolov, the introduced changes apply to all those liable for military service and not just to conscripts, he told state news agency TASS. Russia’s Defense Ministry routinely conscripts men for compulsory military service twice per year, in spring and autumn. The spring conscription this year will apply to 147,000 citizens between the ages of 18 and 27, and will take place from April 1 to July 15, according to an official document published by the government. More context: The Kremlin has consistently denied rumors of a possible second wave of mobilization in Russia. Its “partial mobilization” last year for its invasion of Ukraine resulted in a significant number of citizens fleeing Russia. Conscription involves the selection and enlistment of young men into the military, while mobilization refers to the larger-scale process of calling up reservists and other military personnel in the event of an emergency or war.   The UK has announced sanctions on a network of companies and individuals with financial links to Russian oligarch and ex-Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, as well as oligarch Alisher Usmanov. It said the move would target those helping the pair to “avoid the full cost” of sanctions already imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  “We are closing the net on the Russian elite and those who try to help them hide their money for war,” UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement.  “There’s no place to hide. We will keep cutting them off from assets they thought were successfully hidden. Together with our international partners the UK will continue to crack down on those who are supporting the war. We won’t stop until Putin does.” Among those sanctioned are Demetris Ioannides and Christodoulos Vassiliades, whom the statement described as “two Cypriot professional enablers” of Abramovich and Usmanov. Companies which the Foreign Office said were part of Usmanov’s financial network were also sanctioned, including USM, Curzon Square and Hanley Limited, according to the statement.  Several family members of other Russian oligarchs who it said were “used as proxies to hide their assets” were also sanctioned, according to the statement.  The assets of Usmanov and Abramovich were frozen by the UK government shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  A new bill allowing for the electronic delivery of military draft papers is meant to fix a chaotic process of registration and enlistment, the Kremlin said Wednesday.  “We must be aware that we must regulate the system of military registration and conscription. According to the Constitution, conscripts must serve in the army. This is a constitutional duty of citizens. When the special military operation began, we saw that in some places we had a lot of chaos in the military registration and enlistment offices,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told press on a Wednesday conference call.  The bill is designed to “fix the mess” and make the process “modern, efficient and convenient for citizens,” he said.  Russian officials have denied suggestions that the bill lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization, after a chaotic order in September prompted scores of Russians to flee the country.  But the measure will make it harder for Russians to evade conscription. On Tuesday, the State Duma -- the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament -- voted in favor of allowing electronic delivery of military call-up papers in addition to traditional letters. The upper chamber, the Federation Council, approved the bill on Wednesday. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Putin is “aware” of the legislation and will “read the document” before signing it, Peskov added.  He also said the bill was passed through in “accordance with the procedure provided for in the State Duma,” and questions regarding the speed in which the bill passed should be addressed to Parliament. The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said on Wednesday. “The EU reiterates its firm commitment to holding to account all perpetrators and accomplices of war crimes committed in connection with Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,” Massrali said.  The statement is in response to two videos released on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. “If confirmed, this is yet another brutal reminder about the inhumane nature of the Russian aggression,” Maasrali said. “Killing prisoners of war is a very serious breach of the Geneva convention and demonstrates once more Russia’s complete disregard of international law, in particular, international humanitarian law.”  A video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier has sparked widespread outrage and a war crimes investigation by Ukraine's security services. Elsewhere, authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea have canceled planned Victory Day parades citing security concerns. Here are the latest headlines: Beheading video sparks war crimes investigation: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a war crimes investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier, and President Volodymyr Zelensky called for those involved to be punished. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers,"" he said.
            Kremlin calls for video to be verified: Video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is “terrible,” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of it, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. 
            Russia speaks out on Gershkovich: Russia will not tolerate attempts by the US to “pressure” it over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday. Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The US State Department has designated him as being wrongfully detained.
            Russia cancels parades: Authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled parades and marches to celebrate Victory Day on May 9,  as well as May Day (May 1), citing security reasons. The two dates are public holidays in Russia, with May 9 marking Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. 
            Ukraine requests aid from India: Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova has requested more medicine and medical equipment from India, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. Dzhaparova also “proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies.""
            EU condemns Russia over civil society forum: The European Union strongly condemns the decision of Russian authorities to declare the activities of EU-Russia Civil Society Forum ""undesirable."" The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Tuesday had effectively shut down the Berlin-based organization which hosts intergovernmental conferences and civil society events. ##Catch Up## A Ukrainian defense ministry official has appealed for people to stop sharing video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier.  “We urge to stop the sharing of this video, as well as any similar video footage,"" said Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar.  ""Now after everyone has seen it, prosecutors and the International Court should watch it.” Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week: One purports to show the execution of a captured Ukrainian solider, and a second purports to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground. “From the first moments after the video of the execution of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian inhumans appeared, all competent Ukrainian services have been carefully studying it frame by frame in order to identify the war criminals,"" said Maliar on Telegram. “Tonight, we were doing just that together with other law enforcement agencies and special services,"" she added. Maliar also appealed to the public to refrain from guessing the identity of the soldier in the apparent execution video, saying authorities “are doing everything to identify the deceased.” The United Nations says it is “appalled by particularly gruesome videos posted on social media” -- one of which purports to show the execution of a captured Ukrainian solider, and a second which purports to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground. In a short statement, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, part of the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), says the apparent executions are “not an isolated incident.” “In recent reports the Mission documented a number of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including those committed against prisoners of war. The latest incidents must also be properly investigated, and the perpetrators must be held accountable,” the statement said. On March 24, the UN said it has documented dozens of cases of summary executions of prisoners of war (POWs) carried out by both Russian and Ukrainian forces since February 2022, but admits it is far harder to get information from Russia, or territories under Russian control, than it is from Ukrainian authorities. The OHCHR said it has documented the summary execution of 15 Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces, in addition to the use of Ukrainian POWs as human shields, the death of two wounded POWs due to lack of medical care, as well as torture.  On the other side, the report says it has documented -- through open-source information, in situ visits and witness interviews -- the summary execution of at least 25 Russian POWs being held by Ukrainian forces.  Video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is “terrible,” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of it, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “Of course, these are terrible shots. Then it may be a reason to check whether this is true or not, whether this took place and, if so, where and from which side,"" Peskov said during a regular call with journalists on Wednesday. Two videos purporting to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers have emerged on social media in the past week. Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the perpetrators to be punished. “There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,” he said. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,” Zelensky added. Video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is Russian propaganda and “an illegal execution by terrorists, by the occupying state,"" a Ukrainian official said Wednesday. “We are now conducting a detailed check of the content, the location, and who it is,"" Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, told national TV.  “This is another blatant fact of violation of all possible rules and norms of warfare. I am not even mentioning the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law,” he added. “This is a fact that the world must pay attention to -- not only with sympathy or indignation, but by working together to bring all those responsible to justice.” Yusov said the publication of the video is evidence “that such a genocidal policy, such a war crimes policy, is a state policy”. “Propaganda in Russia is centralized. There is a periodic posting of such videos of atrocities by the Russian military, we recently saw the execution of a Ukrainian soldier for the slogan ‘Glory to Ukraine,’ in general, once a month, once every few weeks, such content appears,"" he added.  “This is a deliberate state policy of the Russian Federation to cover the atrocities of its army against the Ukrainians, against Ukrainian military,” said Yusov. He said the goal of the policy is “undoubtedly an attempt to demoralize and sow panic among the Ukrainian defense and security forces, which they are failing at”. “Also, the purpose of such public atrocities, torture and executions is, in particular, to intimidate their soldiers.”    Two videos purporting to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers have emerged on social media in the past week.                                   Russia will not tolerate attempts by the US to “pressure” it over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.  Ryabkov told journalists Russia was considering allowing US diplomats consular access to Gershkovich, adding that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was in working contact with the US embassy.  “On this issue we are acting in full compliance with our laws, naturally taking into account the provisions of the consular convention and are guided by available precedent in this area,"" said Ryabkov. ""Therefore, we reject any attempts to pressure us.”  Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The US State Department has designated him as being wrongfully detained, Next week a Moscow court will hear an appeal filed by Gershkovich's lawyers against the decision that he should be held in the notorious Lefortovo pre-detention center until May 29, according to state media outlet RIA Novosti.  Ryabkov also said that the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks could be fake and deliberately planted with the aim of misleading Russia, according to TASS. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a war crimes investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier, it announced Wednesday. “Yesterday, a video was posted online of the Russian occupiers showing their beast side by brutally torturing a Ukrainian prisoner and cutting off his head,” the SBU said in a statement on Telegram. “The Security Service of Ukraine launched a pre-trial investigation into this war crime under Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine,” the SBU said. ""We will find these inhumans. If necessary, we will get them wherever they are: from under the ground or from the other side. But they will definitely be punished for their actions,"" SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk added. The video seen by CNN, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground.  It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. The video was one of two purportedly showing beheaded Ukrainian soldiers that have emerged on social media in the past week. The other may have been filmed more recently. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Russia “worse than ISIS” and said it is “absurd” that the country is currently presiding over the UN Security Council. “Russian terrorists must be kicked out of Ukraine and the UN and be held accountable for their crimes,” he said on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, tweeted: “Russian soldier is recorded enjoying cutting off head of Ukrainian war prisoner. Proving their beast nature and convincing world of RF's [Russian Federation’s] bloodthirstiness once again.” “There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said in response to a social media video that purportedly shows the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,” he said in a video message on Wednesday. Two videos have emerged in the past week that purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. Dariia Zarivna, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement Wednesday that the videos are ""aimed at intimidation."" “It completely dehumanizes and demonstrates the essence of a terrorist country,” she said of the videos. “But it is important to understand the purpose. This is an PSYOP [psychological operation] aimed at intimidation. The target audience is not only Ukraine, but also Western societies,” she said. “It doesn't work on us, though. The Russians are afraid of this, but not us,” she added. The videos appear to be of separate events -- one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The second video was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier.  A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova has requested more medicine and medical equipment from India, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. Dzhaparova concluded a three-day visit to India on Wednesday, where she met with Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi. In a statement issued by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) following her visit, Dzhaparova also “proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies."" According to the MEA, she “handed over a letter from President Zelensky, addressed to Prime Minister Modi,"" but the ministry didn't provide further details about the letter. The MEA also announced that the next session of the Inter-Governmental Commission, a group focused on trade and bilateral cooperation between the two countries, will be held in India.  In contrast, the next round of Foreign Office Consultations, which focus on diplomatic ties between the two countries, will take place in Kyiv. The dates for both meetings are yet to be decided. The European Union strongly condemns the decision of Russian authorities to declare the activities of EU-Russia Civil Society Forum as ""undesirable,"" according to a statement from the European Union External Action (EEAS) on Wednesday.  The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Tuesday had effectively shut down the Berlin-based organization which hosts intergovernmental conferences and civil society events. ""Civil society cooperation beyond borders and people-to-people contacts can only be desirable. However, under the current circumstances, we do not have any other choice than to discontinue cooperation with our partners from Russia,"" the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum said on LinkedIn as its webpage has now gone offline. This decision further intensifies the crackdown on independent civil society and media in Russia, taking place against the backdrop of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EEAS said in its statement. The European Union urges the Russian authorities to repeal the current legislation on the so-called “undesirable organizations” and “foreign agents”, which severely restricts the freedoms of association and opinion, the statement added. ""The European Union stands in solidarity with Russian citizens who are prevented from exercising their human rights. We will continue to support the important work of Russian civil society organizations, human rights defenders and independent media and journalists inside and outside Russia,"" it added. Authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled parades and marches to celebrate Victory Day on May 9 and May Day (May 1) citing security reasons. The two dates are public holidays in Russia, with May 9 marking Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.   ""The authorities of the Republic of Crimea and the city-hero of Sevastopol made a joint decision not to hold festive demonstrations on May 1, the ‘Immortal Regiment’ marches and the military parade on May 9. This decision is due to security reasons,"" the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea Sergey Aksenov said on Telegram. ""Despite the cancellation of festive events, our veterans will not be left without attention,"" he added.  Aksenov noted that representatives of local authorities will visit veterans and congratulate them on Victory Day. The situation in Crimea: While any Ukrainian offensive to reclaim Crimea is at best distant, the Russians are taking no chances.  As CNN reported last month, Russia is going to great lengths to fortify the peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014.  The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, has been carrying out attacks in Crimea with two goals: harass the Russian Black Sea fleet and disrupt vital Russian supply lines. Few details emerge about Ukrainian strikes in Crimea. Only occasionally does unofficial social media video provide clues about what has been hit. And only occasionally do normally circumspect Ukrainian officials refer to any actions in Crimea. Previous reporting  from CNN's Tim Lister Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. The videos appear to be of separate events – one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker’s identification. “(The armoured vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,” the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.”  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. Shortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: “There will be an accountability for everything.” Read more here. The highly classified leaked Pentagon documents posted to social media offer a pessimistic US view of the war's progress in Ukraine.  The documents highlight flaws in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses and predict a stalemate in the war for months to come. The documents, which appear to date from February and March, detail many of Ukraine's perceived military shortfalls as Kyiv prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  Several of the classified documents warn Ukraine's medium-range air defenses to protect front-line troops will be ""completely reduced by May 23,"" suggesting Russia could soon have aerial superiority and Ukraine could lose the ability to amass ground forces in a counteroffensive.  The documents also underscore lingering problems with Russia's own military offensive, predicting that the result will be a stalemate between the two sides for the foreseeable future. Officials familiar with the situation tell CNN the documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing deck prepared for the Pentagon's senior leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.  The leaking of the documents — many of which are marked top secret — represents a major national security breach, and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security.  In addition to the assessment of the Ukraine war, the documents include intelligence gathered on allies and adversaries alike. Here are the latest headlines:  UN says nearly 8,500 civilian deaths confirmed in Ukraine since invasion: The  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine. between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration. 
            Ukraine's top national security official downplays leaked intelligence documents: Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to Oleksii Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council. ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod, of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov.
            Americans detained by Russia: Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with the parents of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal correspondent detained in Russia, Tuesday. It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist.
            Russia conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile: Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the Defense Ministry reports.  Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the Defense Ministry reports.  ""On April 11, 2023, a Strategic Missile Forces combat crew conducted a successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Kapustin Yar state central joint forces test range in the Astrakhan region,"" the statement said. The launch helped confirm the correctness of schematic and structural and technical solutions used in developing new strategic missile systems, the Defense Ministry said. The missile's test warhead hit the target at the Sary Shagan firing range (Republic of Kazakhstan) with the target accuracy, according to the statement.  “The objectives of the launch were fulfilled in full,"" the statement read.  Back in February, Russia carried out a test of an ICBM that appears to have failed around the time President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that ""such testing is routine."" Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s failure to grant consular access to wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich “puts it, once again, in violation of international commitments it’s made."" “I think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access, never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes, is going to do even more damage to Russia's standing around the world — a standing that has been in free-fall, particularly since its rei-nvasion of Ukraine last year,” Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. “I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there, lest they be arbitrarily detained,” he said. Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist. Blinken did say what measures are being taken to free Gershkovich, only saying that the US is “engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan’s release.”",0
300,US inflation falls to lowest level since May 2021,"Prices are moving in a more palatable direction for US consumers.  Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, dropped in March for the ninth consecutive month. And for the first time since September 2020, grocery prices fell on a monthly basis. Prices rose 5% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 6% in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. Annual CPI plunged to its lowest rate since May 2021, helped by year-over-year comparisons to a period when food and energy prices spiked amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Still, CPI showed some cooling on a monthly basis. The index, which measures price changes over time for a basket of goods, ticked up 0.1% from February, as compared to a previous 0.4% increase.  Shelter costs, which tend to reflect lagging data, were the largest contributor of the monthly gain, offsetting sharp declines across energy categories, according to the BLS. The food at home index dropped 0.3% for the month, helped by lower prices for eggs (which fell nearly 11%) and fruits and vegetables (which declined 1.3%). The broader food category was unchanged (0%) for the first time since November 2020. Economists were expecting an annual increase of 5.2% and a monthly gain of 0.2%, according to Refinitiv. ""It's a good print, but it's not the end of the game, it's not the end of the story,"" Erik Lundh, principal economist at the Conference Board, told CNN. ""There's more to come — hopefully, knock on wood — and we're heading in the right direction."" Stripping out the often-volatile components of food and energy, core CPI grew 0.4% for the month, resulting in a 5.6% annual growth rate. In February, core CPI accelerated 0.5% month on month and 5.5% year over year. ""On the surface, price pressures are lessening. But when the box is opened, [core inflation] accelerated to the highest rate since May 2021,"" economist Sung Won Sohn, president of SS Economics and Loyola Marymount University professor, said in a statement. ""This is well over the 2% target set by the central bank."" He added: ""More hikes in the interest rate are coming."" CPI is one of the major inflation gauges that's being watched like a hawk by the Federal Reserve, which is in the throes of a yearlong campaign to battle inflation through monetary tightening and stark interest rate hikes.  Base effects in play The 1 percentage point drop in headline CPI is the largest downward swing seen in more than eight years; however, that feat was accomplished largely due to last year's inflation spike. ""Inflation really started to take off last spring and through June,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNN. ""And so things are going to feel a lot better here in the next few months because of those base effects."" Because month-to-month changes can be volatile, even in spite of seasonal adjustments, year-over-year comparisons typically can help smooth out some of that jumpiness.  But times have been anything but typical for the past three years. So, for the months ahead, moving averages become all the more critical to observe, Lundh said.  While the picture is more clear for the trajectory of headline CPI, it's a little more opaque for core and ""supercore"" activity (core services, excluding housing), Zandi said.  The base effects are much less pronounced for core CPI, because the spring and summer inflation spike was driven by food, energy and goods prices. ""Core inflation is remaining more persistent,"" he said. ""I expect improvement really toward the middle and second half of the year when the cost of housing services really begins to slow."" Shelter costs, as measured in the CPI, tend to lag more than other categories as the BLS collects rent data every six months and most rents don't change too frequently. Private-sector data shows that apartment rents have fallen in recent months, suggesting an eventual cooldown in shelter prices will show up in the CPI. Stripping out housing, however, still leaves a ""supercore"" inflation measurement that has remained stubbornly high. ""Supercore correlates with wages; thus, the Fed would be looking at some relief in this metric as a sign of slower wage gains,"" Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, said in a statement. ""Today's report shows the supercore decelerated in March, but it remains a sticky component of inflation, running around +4% annualized on a three- and six-month basis.""   ""This is too fast and a sign that the labor market remains offsides,"" he added. More Fed rate hikes still on the horizon The March CPI trajectory doesn't take another rate hike off the table, Lundh said.  ""There was some encouraging news in the inflation data today, but I don't think it's sufficient to cause the Fed to pause,"" he said. ""So we're expecting to see a [quarter-point] hike in the May meeting and even potentially another hike following that.""  The Fed's fight grew more complex in March with the collapse of two regional US banks, which then caused turmoil in the financial industry. The Fed, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to shore up depositors and prevent future bank runs. However, there are expectations that the turmoil could mean future credit tightening, which in turn could dampen demand and even help the Fed in its inflation-fighting goals. However, it could also create more uncertainty about a future recession. ""The CPI is backwards looking and the Fed still has to consider how much of a credit crunch to factor into the economy,"" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management, in a statement. While inflation has moderated since reaching a decades-high level last summer, the pace has been slower than anticipated as a strong labor labor market and resilient consumer spending has continued to fuel economic growth.",0
301,"Investors are watching guidance this earnings season, but might not like what they see","Corporate guidance statements will be front and center as earnings season kicks off, with investors trying to gauge the economy's temperature. Things could get chilly. Analysts forecast that first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 will fall 6.8% from the same period the previous year, according to FactSet. That would be the biggest earnings decline since profits plunged nearly 32% in the second quarter of 2020, after the onset of the Covid pandemic. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who's poised to weather it? Investors might be disappointed by what they find. ""We all expect earnings to be less than stellar,"" says Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banríon Capital Management. ""In the last quarterly earnings, we saw a lot of really negative guidance from companies, and I don't foresee that being much different going forward."" Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector's health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy's precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading this week, after investors digested a jobs report that came in below expectations and awaited a slate of inflation data that could help decide the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Stocks rose Wednesday morning after the latest Consumer Price Index showed that annual headline inflation cooled in March for a ninth consecutive month. ""We're going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market's going up and earnings are going down,"" says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. Expected turbulence ahead The White House and other officials have called on regulators to implement tighter rules for banks to prevent future collapses. The Biden administration last month urged federal banking agencies to reverse the Trump administration's regulatory rollbacks. ""Greater regulation probably means lower margins or lower utilization of balance sheets for banks, which tends to be a bad thing for earnings growth,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede.  Investors have homed in on corporate guidance since last year to gauge companies' pricing power as sticky inflation drove up supply costs and weighed down balance sheets. However, they're particularly important this year, since banking-sector troubles have heightened fears of an economic downturn.  Big Tech stocks will also be in focus. These companies already tend to dominate earnings season due to their outsized weighting in the equities market — Microsoft and Apple have reached a whopping 13.4% combined weighting in the S&P 500, according to data from Strategas Securities. But tech earnings are especially key this time around, since behemoths in the sector have driven much of the equity market's gains this year after becoming a haven for investors during the first quarter. Shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed about 86% this year, Meta Platforms gained about 78% and Tesla surged roughly 52%. Still, earnings are just one factor driving markets, and inflation remains a key concern for the Fed. The central bank raised interest rates last month by a quarter point. Analysts largely expect the Fed to do the same at its May meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won't — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market's resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.  ""You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,"" said Horneman.",0
302,"Whole Foods closes San Francisco flagship store after one year, citing worker safety","An enormous Whole Foods in downtown San Francisco that opened just last year is temporarily closing. The company said concerns about worker safety forced it to shut down. Incidents of theft in San Francisco have gained national attention, though crime has generally fallen over the past six years. The nearly 65,000-square foot location at Trinity Place in the city's Mid-Market neighborhood shut its doors Monday to ""ensure the safety"" of its employees, a Whole Foods spokesperson said. Although Whole Foods did not share any additional information on the conditions that led to the store closing, the spokesperson added that it was a ""difficult decision to close the Trinity store for the time being."" Affected employees will be transferred to nearby stores. The store at 8th and Market streets will not open Tuesday, the spokesperson said. The store's website has also disappeared.  Heralded as a ""flagship store"" following its March 2022 opening, the Whole Foods was one of the largest supermarkets in downtown San Francisco. The store sold 3,700 local products and was designed with ""nods to classic San Francisco,"" according to a news release.  The San Francisco Standard, an independent news website, reported that this Whole Foods location had previously reduced operating hours last year because of theft and changed its bathrooms after employees found syringes and pipes.  San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Matt Dorsey said on Twitter that he was ""incredibly disappointed"" by the closure.  ""Our neighborhood waited a long time for this supermarket, but we're also well aware of problems they've experienced with drug-related retail theft, adjacent drug markets, and the many safety issues related to them,"" Dorsey wrote. Appearing on ""CNN This Morning"" Wednesday, Dorsey said he's ""seen a lot of issues of people acting out and shoplifting"" at the store.  ""Fingers crossed we can turn things around here and I do have some optimism, but hopefully we can get this supermarket back open,"" he said. Property crimes in San Francisco have garnered national attention because of several attention-grabbing videos of thieves in action. Though still well below 2017 levels, the city saw a 23% increase in property crimes between 2020 and 2022, with spikes in burglary and theft headlining the surge, according to San Francisco Police Department data. Meanwhile, violent crime statistics in San Francisco have remained relatively steady in recent years. Preliminary police data reports 12 homicides in San Francisco this year, an uptick of 20% compared to the same period in the previous year. In total, there were 56 homicides in San Francisco in 2022, which is the same number of homicides the city saw in 2021. In recent months, national retailers have been complaining about thefts affecting locations. Chains took action by locking up everyday products such as deodorant and toothpaste and added extra security guards. However, a Walgreens executive recently admitted that the impact of the thefts may have been overblown. A San Francisco Cotopaxi store temporarily closed in October 2022, citing theft and employee safety, reopening in mid-November. Cotopaxi CEO Davis Smith, in a LinkedIn post, said at the time that the ""large-scale theft and raiding"" put the store's employees at risk. But he also said he regretted that the store's closure became the subject of a political debate about crime in San Francisco and other cities. ""We had many jumping to our support, some who felt offended by my post, and a few who politicized our store's closure (because these are the times we live in, unfortunately),"" Smith wrote. ""To be clear, I never anticipated that our decision to close our Hayes Valley store would become entangled in political discourse."" This story has been updated from its original version to clarify that the company cited worker safety as a concern.",0
303,Elon Musk says he's cut about 80% of Twitter's staff,"Elon Musk has laid off more than 6,000 people at Twitter since taking over the company, he told the BBC in a rare interview late Tuesday. Musk was quoted as saying in the interview that the social media platform now has only 1,500 employees, down from under 8,000 who were employed at the time of his acquisition. The reduction equates to roughly 80% of the company's staff. It's ""not fun at all"" and can sometimes be ""painful,"" the billionaire CEO told the British broadcaster at Twitter's head office in San Francisco.  The world's second richest man said that ""drastic action"" was needed when he came on board, because the company was facing ""a $3 billion negative cash flow situation."" That left Twitter with only ""four months to live,"" he estimated. ""This is not a caring [or] uncaring situation. It's like, if the whole ship sinks, then nobody's got a job,"" Musk said. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion last October.  After initially offering to take over the company in April 2022, he attempted to get out of the deal, citing concerns over how many bot accounts it had. He has since radically overhauled Twitter: firing top executives, slashing jobs and enacting new policies on how user accounts are verified or labeled. Since then, Twitter is now ""roughly"" breaking even and advertisers are returning to the platform, he told the BBC.  Musk also pledged to revise the label applied to the British broadcaster, from ""government-funded"" to ""publicly-funded"" after the BBC objected. The designation was added over the weekend. The BBC had protested the move, saying that it ""is, and always has been, independent.""  ""We are funded by the British public through the licence fee,"" it said at the time. Musk also weighed in on US scrutiny of TikTok, saying that while he was not a user of the Chinese-owned app, he was usually ""against banning things."" ""I mean, it would help Twitter, I suppose, if TikTok was banned, because then people would spend more time on Twitter and less on TikTok,"" he mused. ""But even though that would help Twitter, I would be generally against banning of things."" Musk also cracked jokes during the interview, saying that he was ""no longer the CEO of Twitter"" and had been replaced by his pet dog, a Shiba Inu named Floki.",0
304,Main Street investors bet on comeback for regional banks,"Forget the banking crisis — Main Street's retail investors have barreled into embattled bank stocks. It looks like nothing tempts people to bet on an industry more than bargain prices, even if they're caused by the fear of imminent collapse.   In January and February, trading in First Republic Bank stock was outright sleepy. Retail investors averaged just about $20,000 in daily net purchases. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, however, that daily average exploded to $10.3 million, according to data through April 10 from VandaTrack. TD Ameritrade's Investment Movement Index, which tracks retail traders, found that its clients were net buyers of First Republic Bank in March even as the company's shares plummeted more than 88% over worries about uninsured deposits and the overall health of the banking system.  So far — and it's very early days — the optimism hasn't paid off: First Republic has been circling $15 a share for the last month, down from a range of $115 to $145 a share in the first two months of 2023.  PacWest Bancorp, meanwhile, another regional bank that sank in the immediate aftermath of the recent turmoil, saw post-SVB retail net purchases of its stock jump to an average of $2.9 million a day, up from virtually none in the first two months of the year. Again, buyers got bargains, paying $9 a share for a stock that had been trading around $30 in the previous few months. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, which tracks a range of mid-sized banks, saw overall net purchases grow to an average $3.9 million a day, up from net sales of $120,000 for January and February.  It's not just regional banks. Individual investors have been piling into big bank stocks like Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, data from VandaTrack showed. TD Ameritrade found that the buying interest amongst retail investors was strongest in the financial sector, which was down almost 10% during the period.  Retail investors sought out an opportunity to make ""big pay-outs on a return of confidence,"" in the banking industry, said Marco Iachini​, senior vice president of research at VandaTrack.  At the same time, he said, institutional investors, the so-called ""smart money,"" have been trading out of volatile regional bank stocks. Reddit, meanwhile, is full of posts with titles like ""First Republic Bank is easy money"" and ""Regional Banks are significantly undervalued after SVB failure."" The worry: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned last week in an interview with CNN that the banking crisis is far from over and that its consequences will likely be felt for years.  That could mean bad news for those who are betting they'll see big returns on regional bank stocks. This is a risky move for retail investors, said Iachini​, and a speculative play.  And while retail flows into bank stocks are still high, they have waned significantly since mid-March. ""That tells me retail capital isn't here to stay,"" said Iachini.  We're not seeing a meaningful recovery, at least yet, for regional bank stocks, he said. What we're seeing instead is a light version of what happened as individual investors fueled meme stocks in the early days of the pandemic.  Why Warren Buffett likes Japan's trading houses The Oracle of Omaha has set his eyes on Osaka.  In an interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei on Tuesday, billionaire investing wiz Warren Buffett said that he plans on adding to his investments in Japan.  In August 2020, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had purchased a stake of about 5% in Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Marubeni. He increased his holdings of those five financial ""trading houses"" in November.  Investors abroad often shy away from investing in Japanese trading houses — they're large complex corporations involved in trading, investing, financing, and importing/exporting and often have business units all over the world. They also tend to be relatively secretive about their business operations.  But Buffett said Wednesday that he wasn't bothered by the complexity of investing in these multi-faceted entities.  ""We feel that these five companies are a cross section of not only Japan but of the world,"" he said. ""They are really so much similar to Berkshire. They own a lot of different things."" Buffett gave the rare interview in Tokyo where he plans to meet with all five companies this week ""to really just have a discussion around their businesses and emphasize our support."" This is Buffett's first trip to Japan since 2011. He added that he is looking into other Japanese companies to invest in. ""At the moment, we only own the five trading companies. There are always a few I'm thinking about,"" he said.  Shares of the five trading companies soared after Nikkei published the interview. Goolsbee preaches caution Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee addressed the ""new, big, hairy elephant in the room,"" on Tuesday. That would be the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and subsequent market turmoil. ""At moments of financial stress like this, the right monetary policy is really caution and watchfulness and prudence,"" said Goolsbee in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago. ""And I don't say that because I think we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation just because markets got upset."" But these financial woes shouldn't come before monetary policy, said Goolsbee, who is the newest Fed appointee. ""History has taught us that in moments of financial stress, even if they don't escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting monetary policy,"" he said. Minutes from the March Federal Reserve policy meeting are due out at 2 p.m. on Wednesday and the next policy decision will come in early May. Goolsbee said he'll be watching data closely for signs that credit supply is tightening.",0
305,Warren Buffett gives reason for surprise sale of stake in Taiwan's TSMC,"Warren Buffett says geopolitical tensions were ""a consideration"" in the decision to sell most of Berkshire Hathaway's shares in global chip giant TSMC, which is based in Taiwan. The 92-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" shed light on the investment call in a Tuesday interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei. He was quoted as sayiing that TSMC was a well-managed company but that Berkshire had ""better places"" to deploy its capital. In February, Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it had sold 86% of its shares in TSMC, which were purchased for $4.1 billion just months before. The quick sale was considered unusual because the billionaire is known for making longer term bets. The size of the purchase suggested that the initial purchase was most likely made personally by Buffett himself, rather than one of his portfolio managers, Reuters reported. TSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan and supplies semiconductors to tech giants including Apple and Qualcomm. It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China — which claims Taiwan as its own territory despite having never controlled it — that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a ""silicon shield"" against a potential military invasion by Beijing.  TSMC's presence is seen as providing a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force. This week, tensions soared across the Taiwan Strait after China simulated ""joint precision strikes"" on the island during a series of military exercises.  Beijing launched the drills on Saturday, a day after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a 10-day visit to Central America and the United States where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Chinese officials described the drills as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Beijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island. Taiwan and China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago, in which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei.",0
306,Louisiana state troopers involved in deadly Ronald Greene arrest plead not guilty,"The five Louisiana law enforcement officers charged in the May 2019 violent arrest of Black motorist Ronald Greene pleaded not guilty at their arraignment on Tuesday.  The five defendants were all present in court with their respective attorneys, according to J. Michael Small, who is representing Kory York, one of the Louisiana State troopers involved in Greene's arrest.  York is facing a charge of negligent homicide. The charges for the three other troopers and one Union Parish deputy range from malfeasance in office to obstruction of justice, according to a copy of the indictment provided to CNN by Union Parish District Attorney John Belton.  Speaking to CNN before the hearing, Mona Hardin, Greene's mother, said, ""Justice delayed is not justice denied. Louisiana, right your wrongs!"" Greene, 49, died during the overnight hours of May 10, 2019, after police said he resisted arrest and struggled with officers. His family has said they were initially told Greene died in a car crash after a police chase.  Videos of the arrest -- released by the Associated Press and then by state police in May 2021 -- revealed graphic details of the violent struggle, showing officers kicking, punching and using a Taser on Greene before he died in their custody.  It took more than three years after Greene's death, which one Louisiana State Police member described as ""torture and murder,"" for the officers to be indicted.  The next court hearing will be held May 12, during which the sufficiency to clarify the details in the indictment will be heard, according to Small. The family has filed a wrongful-death civil lawsuit against the troopers involved in the incident and their superiors. The family is seeking damages for all medical and funeral expenses.  Troopers York and Dakota DeMoss were both shown in the arrest video, along with Trooper Chris Hollingsworth, who died in a car crash in September 2020, according to the Ouachita Parish Coroner's Office.  York initially received a 50-hour suspension for his role, according to state police. After serving his suspension, he returned to active duty pending the outcome of the review by federal and state authorities.  In May 2021, DeMoss was fired over an excessive force incident not involving Greene, according to a Louisiana state official with knowledge of the investigation.  Charles Racer, an attorney for DeMoss, told CNN he had ""no comment"" about the arraignment and referred all inquiries to the Louisiana State Police. CNN has reached out to the attorneys for the other officers charged.",0
307,What we know about the fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker as grand jury considers the case,"The city of Akron, Ohio, is bracing for the findings of a special grand jury, which has been tasked with deciding if any of the eight police officers directly involved in the fatal shooting of Jayland Walker last summer will face criminal charges. The shooting -- in which Walker, who was Black, was shot dozens of times -- came after police said the 25-year-old fled an attempted traffic stop early one morning last June. Walker's death prompted an investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, along with protests over racial injustice and police use of force -- a few of which erupted into violence, resulting in damage to local businesses, according to Akron police.  Walker was unarmed at the time he was killed, according to police, though a gun was found in his vehicle after the shooting, and officers said Walker fired a gun from his vehicle during the car chase.  The Ohio BCI investigation has been completed and was referred to the special prosecutor, a spokesperson for the Ohio Attorney General's Office confirmed to CNN last month. The office declined to comment on any matters related to grand jury proceedings. The city and attorneys for Walker's family, however, acknowledged the grand jury review was underway in statements to CNN, with the latter criticizing the process as one that favored the police.  ""Today an Akron grand jury began its process of determining whether the officers who gunned down Jayland Walker last summer will be held criminally accountable for their actions,"" attorney Bobby DiCello said in a statement Monday.  ""As part of that process, as Ohio law allows, the officers will be invited to testify before the grand jury on their behalf. Keep in mind that if any other Akron citizen was accused of a crime, they would not necessarily be afforded that same privilege,"" he said. ""Simply put, it's a process that favors the officers.""  City officials hosted public meetings to address concerns about the grand jury proceedings and how any decision might impact the community. At one, Police Chief Stephen Mylett said he was ""anticipating that there is going to be a response from Akron and beyond.""  The city also has established a demonstration zone downtown, along with temporary barriers and fencing around court and municipal buildings -- moves a city spokesperson described as purely precautionary. Here's what we know about the shooting of Jayland Walker:  What police say happened Walker was killed in a burst of gunfire early June 27, 2022, following a vehicle pursuit and foot chase that started when officers tried to stop him for traffic and equipment violations.  Walker fled the stop and officers gave chase, according to a narrated video timeline police played at a news conference July 3, when police released parts of body camera videos from 13 officers at the scene. About 40 seconds after the start of the pursuit, the narrated video said, ""a sound consistent with a gunshot can be heard"" in body camera footage, and the officers told dispatch a gunshot had been fired from Walker's vehicle. Police also showed still images taken from traffic cameras that showed ""a flash of light"" -- purportedly a muzzle flash -- along the driver's side of the car.  ""That changes the whole nature"" of the incident, Mylett said at the time, turning a ""routine traffic stop"" into a ""public safety issue.""  After several minutes, Walker's vehicle slowed and he exited and ran, police said. Several police officers got out of their patrol cars and chased him, and officers deployed Tasers in an effort to stop him, police said, but were unsuccessful.  Moments later, police said, Walker ""stopped and quickly turned towards the pursuing officers."" Mylett told reporters officers believed Walker was reaching towards his waist and they ""felt that Mr. Walker had turned and was motioning and moving into a firing position,"" Mylett said, and officers opened fire, killing him.  Walker was handcuffed behind his back after the shooting -- a move Mylett said was in accordance with department policy. Mylett indicated at a community event in late March that adjustments would be made to the policy.  Walker had 46 wounds, medical examiner found Walker suffered 46 gunshot entrance or graze wounds, according to an autopsy by Summit County Medical Examiner Dr. Lisa Kohler, who found the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds.  Per Kohler, the wounds included: • 15 on Walker's torso, where he had internal injuries to his heart, lungs, liver, spleen, left kidney, intestines and multiple ribs. • 17 on his pelvis and upper legs, where the right major artery going to the leg and the bladder were injured and the pelvis and both femurs were broken. • One on his face, where the jaw broke. • Eight on his arms and right hand. • Five on his knees, right lower leg and right foot. Though police accused Walker of firing a gunshot out his vehicle's window, a gunshot residue test was not performed as part of the autopsy, Kohler said, explaining gunshot residue testing can detect specific particles related to the discharge of a firearm ""but the results of that testing is not conclusive as to whether the person did or did not fire a weapon.""  The FBI discontinued this testing in 2006, and Kohler said her office discontinued the collection of that sampling a decade later and no longer purchases collection kits. 8 officers placed on leave, then reinstated Eight police officers ""directly involved"" in the shooting were initially placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, according to department protocol, Mylett said.  They were reinstated by October 10, a decision Mylett attributed to ""staffing issues"" in comments to CNN affiliate WEWS, acknowledging ""there may be some community concern.""  While back at work, the officers were not in uniform or responding to service calls, the Akron Police Department said.  According to information released by the city, seven of the eight officers are White and one is Black.  ""The decision to deploy lethal force as well as the number of shots fired is consistent with use of force protocols and officers' training,"" the Fraternal Order of Police Akron Lodge 7 said in a statement last year.  What videos show The week following the shooting, police released 13 videos from officers' body cameras -- eight from the officers directly involved in the shooting and five others from others who were at the scene.  The videos were released according to a city ordinance requiring video footage documenting an active police officer's use of force to be released within seven days of the incident. Toward the end of the pursuit, some of the footage shows the silver car Walker was driving stopping before he begins to exit the driver's side. At least one officer shouts, ""Let me see your hands,"" and tells him not to move. The video shows Walker getting back into the car, which slowly moves forward. He is then seen getting out of the passenger side door and running from officers. At least one officer again yells for Walker to show his hands, one video shows. The foot chase continued for several seconds, before a series of gunshots ring out over seven seconds.  The videos end right after the gunshots were fired and do not depict police officers' efforts to provide medical care, though police say they attempted first aid after the shooting.  Walker was declared dead at the scene. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, CNN obtained in early September 24 more heavily redacted video clips showing more than four hours of the shooting and its immediate aftermath.  Each video contains several sections where the footage is blurred or blacked out, or where audio is muted. The city told CNN at the time this was done to redact officers' identifying information. In several videos, gunfire is heard for seven to eight seconds, followed by officers' attempts to determine whether Walker is armed while he lies face-up and non-responsive on the ground.  ""Can anyone see the gun?"" one officer is heard repeatedly asking, as a group of officers stand with guns still aimed at Walker. ""Where is the weapon at?"" one is heard asking in several videos.  Several officers are heard rendering first aid, shouting for light and asking for tourniquets and packing gauze.  None of the videos showed the inside of Walker's car, though some show officers approaching the vehicle after the shooting. ""It's got a firearm in it,"" one officer is heard saying. Police are seen in other footage trying to sequester police who fired at Walker while discussing collecting their body-worn cameras.",0

Louisville shooting The city of Louisville will hold a vigil today to let community members grieve the five people killed this week in a bank shooting. The vigil comes a day after police released dramatic police body camera footage of the shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say a 25-year-old employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The shooter's motive for the rampage remains unclear at this time as authorities continue to comb through evidence. However, officials are expected to release audio today of 911 calls that could reveal more key details, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. The mayor on Tuesday also pleaded for state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence in Kentucky, which has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. 2. Indiana fire About 2,000 people in eastern Indiana received evacuation orders Tuesday after a large fire at a recycling plant began emitting toxic smoke. The fire, which created a thick, black plume over industrial buildings and a neighborhood, is expected to burn for days -- and is ""definitely toxic,"" Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said. ""There is a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they're on fire, and it's concerning and we want to make for sure we give people heads-up on an evacuation,"" Jones said. A preliminary investigation determined the fire started in a nearby semi-trailer before spreading to the facility, an official said, adding the exact cause will likely remain unknown until after it has been extinguished.  3. Leaked documents The leaked classified Pentagon documents posted to social media suggest the US is pessimistic that Ukraine can quickly end the war against Russia. The documents highlight specific weaknesses in both Ukraine's weaponry and Russia's military offensive, predicting a stalemate for months to come. The documents also indicate some intelligence that defense officials are gathering about China, the country Washington has deemed the ""most serious long-term challenge to the international order."" Officials say the leaking of the documents -- many of which are marked top secret -- represents a major national security breach. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security. 4. Cyclone Ilsa A major cyclone is threatening to hit Western Australia with winds strong enough to lift camper vans and trampolines. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said Cyclone Ilsa is expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday, somewhere between the towns of Broome and Port Hedland. The storm is expected to generate wind gusts of more than 250 kph (155 mph) by Thursday evening, equivalent to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the US. Local authorities warned residents to tie down anything that could become airborne and urged tourists to move from the projected path of the storm. Many people have flocked to supermarkets to stock up on food and other supplies ahead of the dangerous conditions. 5. Banned books A rural Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its public library shelves is now considering shutting down its libraries entirely. A meeting in Llano County today will include a discussion of whether to ""continue or cease operations"" of the library system, which includes three branches. The meeting comes after a federal judge last month ordered the library system to return 12 children's books to its shelves that had been removed, many because of their LGBTQ and racial content. It also follows several ongoing fights across the country to protect access to books in response to a boom of book bans that has taken shape in the US -- including in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries.

309,Kentucky has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the US,"A 25-year-old man in Kentucky legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership. Six days later he used that weapon to kill five of his colleagues at a downtown bank, Louisville Metro Police said Tuesday. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. Gun enthusiasts have described it as ""one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi."" By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state's laws as ""among the worst in the country.""  Kentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. ""Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there's no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they're ever used in a crime,"" CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said. ""Red flag"" laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out. If the Louisville mass shooter's behavior ""had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,"" she said. Prior to 2019 -- when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit -- individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. ""They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,"" Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone  eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there's no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over. Gun deaths across Kentucky in 2021 were 25% greater than in 2018, the year before permitless carry was allowed in the state, Mascia, said, adding gun homicides during the same time period were up  75%, which she said bucks the idea advanced by gun proponents that the best solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. While federal and state law prohibits convicted felons from gun possession, in Kentucky, domestic abusers on restraining orders, stalkers, fugitives, individuals convicted of hate crimes, and people found to be a danger to themselves or others all have legal access to guns, according to Everytown. In an emotionally charged press conference Tuesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, US Representative Morgan McGarvey and University of Louisville Health Chief Medical Officer Jason Smith called for city, state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence. ""The laws we have now are enabling violence and murder,"" the mayor said, and slammed a state law that requires law enforcement to put seized firearms up for auction to federally licensed firearms dealers holding a license appropriate for the type of firearm sold. Under Kentucky law, certain confiscated guns that are not retained for official use ""shall be sold at public auction,"" with partial proceeds going to public safety programs.  ""Think about that: that murder weapon will be back on the streets one day,"" Greenberg said. ""It's time to change this law and let us destroy illegal guns and destroy the guns that have been used to kill our friends and kill our neighbors."" ""We have to take action now. We need short term action to end this gun violence epidemic now, so fewer people die on our streets and in our banks in our schools,"" the mayor added. ""I don't care about finger pointing. I don't care about blame. I don't care about politics. I'm only interested in working together with our state legislators to take meaningful action to save lives to prevent more tragic injuries, and more death.""",0
310,Authorities in Louisville release bodycam video of police response to shooting at bank that left 5 people dead,"The Louisville Metro Police Department has released dramatic bodycam video of officers responding to the Monday bank shooting where five people were killed and an officer fatally shot the gunman.  The bodycam video shows the tense moments between police officers and the shooter, Connor Sturgeon. It begins with video from Officer Nickolas Wilt who drives up to the scene with his training officer, identified as Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. Wilt, police say, was shot in the head as he ran toward the gunshots police were facing as they arrived. He is listed in critical condition. Wilt's camera shows him following Galloway up the outside steps to the bank, his service pistol in his two hands. The video cuts off before he is shot. Bodycam footage from Galloway, who was also shot, shows him taking fire, then retreating to a safe position behind a planter as officers talk about how they can't see the gunman and that he is shooting through windows in the front of the bank. ""Shooter has an angle on that officer!"" one officer can be heard saying. ""We got to get up there!"" he adds. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said the gunman broke out glass from the lobby windows and when he fired, officers -- who could finally pinpoint his location -- shot back.  As he looks into the bank lobby, Galloway's camera audio sounds out with several shots. ""Suspect down, get the officer!!"" one officer yells as he moves up the stairs and into the bank to investigate further. Humphrey lauded the actions of the officers. ""Officer Wilt was a brand new officer, he had no experience. He was going based on two things: his training and his character. And you will see that he never hesitates -- even after getting shot at,"" Humphrey said at a news conference where nine minutes of video was released. When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Humphrey told reporters. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is ""100% certainty"" that those swift actions saved lives. ""The actions that they took to follow up after being shot at themselves, to be compassionate and provide medical treatment, absolutely saved lives that day,"" Humphrey said Officers took Wilt to the hospital in a patrol vehicle, officials said.  Shooter recently purchased his rifle The shooter legally bought an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership six days before he used it to kill five of his colleagues, the interim Louisville Metro Police chief said Tuesday. Currently, ""Kentucky imposes no waiting period between the time of purchase and the physical transfer of a firearm,"" according to the Giffords Law Center. By comparison, some states have waiting periods of 7 to 10 days. It's still not clear what provoked Sturgeon, a 25-year-old employee,  to go on a deadly rampage at Old National Bank and livestream the gruesome attack on Instagram. Sturgeon had interned at the bank for three summers and been employed there full-time for about two years, his LinkedIn profile showed. A law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that the assailant had been notified that he was going to be fired from the bank. But Louisville's mayor and police chief have since said otherwise, with interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel telling CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday that that there ""was no discussion about this individual being terminated"" before the massacre. Now, investigators are combing through the footage and other evidence to try to understand what led to the massacre that also left several wounded -- including a police officer who was shot in the head.  Officials executed a search warrant at Sturgeon's home, but Gwinn-Villaroel declined to say what was found.  The carnage marked the 146th mass shooting this year with four or more victims, not including a gunman, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  And the AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago that's reignited a fierce political fight over gun control.  What the livestream video shows It took just one minute for a gunman to complete his deadly rampage before he stopped and waited for police to arrive, according to footage of the massacre described by a city official to CNN.  The video begins by showing an AR-15-style weapon, followed by a worker in the bank saying good morning to the gunman, the official said. ""You need to get out of here,"" the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the livestream, which has been taken down by Instagram's parent company Meta. The gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can't because the safety is on and the weapon still needs to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.  The assailant then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they tried to outrun him, the official said. The shooter does not go to other populated floors of the bank, the official said. Once the shooter is done firing, he sits down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street, apparently waiting for police, the official said. The killer waits about a minute and a half before police arrive --  a swift response praised by local leaders -- and a gunfight ensues, the official said. The gunman was struck and killed. The entire incident -- from when the gunman started shooting to when he was killed -- lasted about nine minutes, Louisville Police Lt. Col. Aaron Cromwell said.  After the first bullets flew, ""There's a few minutes after that before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that when we respond to the scene,"" Cromwell said Tuesday. ""And then about three minutes after we respond, the subject is neutralized."" At one point, a Louisville police dispatcher alerted officers: ""25-year-old White male, Connor Sturgeon 6 4'. He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" according to Broadcastify audio. The timing of the dispatch wasn't immediately clear. A manager 'witnessed people being murdered' during a meeting The massacre started around 8:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Staff members were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the gunman opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN. She said the massacre ""happened very quickly."" Buchheit-Sims attended the staff meeting virtually and watched in horror as gunfire exploded on her computer screen. ""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she told CNN. ""I don't know how else to say that."" Four victims died shortly after the shooting: Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, police said. A fifth victim, Deana Eckert, 57, died later Monday.  Of the nine patients hospitalized shortly after the shooting, four have been discharged and one has died. One still in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, a University of Louisville Hospital spokesperson said Tuesday.  'I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense' Before Monday's massacre, the gunman had not had ""any prior engagement"" with police, the interim chief said.   Sturgeon graduated in December 2020 from the University of Alabama, where he earned his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance, according to a university spokesperson.   After three consecutive summers interning at Old National Bank, he was hired as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.   One of Sturgeon's former high school classmates who knew the shooter and his family well said the horrific news Monday came as a ""total shock.""  ""I can't believe it,"" said the former classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense."" Victim was an 'incredible friend' and mentor One of the slain victims, bank senior vice president Tommy Elliott, was remembered by local and state leaders as a close mentor and beloved community leader.  ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" said Yates, the state senator. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up.""   Elliott was also close friends with the governor and Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott's wife.  ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and called the other slain victims ""amazing people"" who will be mourned by their loved ones.  The city is setting up a family assistance center in collaboration with the American Red Cross to provide support for those impacted, the mayor said.  ""To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,"" Greenberg said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled Tommy Elliott's last name. It has also been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.",0
311,"April 11, 2023 - The latest on the Louisville bank shooting","The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the Monday bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory ""CJ"" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.
            Officer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since he was new, he was acting based on ""his training and his character"" and that he ""never hesitates."" Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said. 
            What happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them ""trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.
            Bystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. You can see an officer outside the bank.
            Before police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live-streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. ##Catch Up## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he is already talking with state lawmakers from both parties about gun reform, one day after a mass shooting at a bank killed five people in his city. Greenberg, who knew one person that was killed, told CNN the victims ""should not be dead,"" as in the case of other people killed by gun violence. While there is a spirit of coming together, he said, “I'm also hopeful we are taking action.” “We have had enough gun violence in Louisville. We have had enough gun violence in our country and it’s time to take action,” he said, pledging to work with other elected officials and community leaders.  Greenberg wants either statewide action in Kentucky or a change to state laws that would allow him to pass reforms in just his city. While he has had preliminary conversations with lawmakers at the state capital on both sides of the aisle, he said more meetings are expected to happen in the coming days to “talk about what we can do together” “This is not about finger-pointing. This isn’t about blame. This isn’t about politics. This is about life and death. And so right now I’m optimistic and hopeful that we can come together to make progress,” Greenberg said. Police released several minutes of officer body camera video Tuesday evening. And Greenberg said two things stood out to him about the footage — first is the bravery of the officers who ran into the building, and the second was the tragedy of watching the events unfold. “Our city is heartbroken” for those killed, the mayor said when asked how the community is reacting. Juliana Farmer, one of the five people killed in a Louisville bank on Monday, is being remembered by her family as someone who loved life. “Her siblings, they lost a sister. Her children lost a mother. Their children lost a grandmother,” Farmer's aunt, Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WAVE. “I lost a niece.”  Farmer, an employee at the bank, had only recently moved to Louisville from Henderson, Brooks-Scott said. “This was her third week on the job,"" she said.  “She loved life. She was a beautiful young lady,” Brooks-Scott said. “All I can say is that heaven has gained a beautiful angel.” Farmer, 45, leaves behind three children and four grandchildren, Brooks-Scott said. A fifth grandchild is expected to arrive in September, she added. “I’m hoping that this baby will be born on September 20th because that was her birthday,” she said. ##Victims## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. LMPD Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey detailed the tense moments when police attempted to rescue Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head as police rushed to the scene of the shooting early Monday. “As they go up the stairs and attempt to rescue Officer Wilt, the suspect fires at them, trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said, describing bodycam video footage released Tuesday from Officer Cory ""C.J."" Galloway. Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, is in critical condition at a local hospital. He graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. “Once he is able to see the threat, he then engages the threat, shoots and kills the suspect."" Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound. When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is ""100% certainty"" that those swift actions saved lives. “The actions that they took to follow up after being shot at themselves, to be compassionate and provide medical treatment, absolutely saved lives that day,"" Humphrey said. He said EMS need to ride in the back of the ambulance with the patients, but they were short-staffed, so police officers offered to drive so the EMS workers could treat a victim on the way to the hospital. ""That's what we do,"" he said. ""We improvise and we make sure that we do everything we can to keep people safe and take care of them."" The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive at Old National Bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey.  At a Tuesday news conference, Humphrey said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" ""He could see out where no one could see in,"" Humphrey said.  Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. Body camera footage shows the tense moments between police officers and the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, outside the Monday bank shooting in Louisville.  Footage from Officer C.

Officer Nickolas Wilt, 26, who ran toward the gunfire, was shot in the head during the incident, police previously announced.  He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting, police said. He is in critical condition at the hospital, officials tell CNN.  Body camera footage shows that Officer Nickolas Wilt went back into the line of fire to protect people, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said during a news conference Tuesday.  Humphrey emphasized the role and mission of police is to protect lives and constitutional rights and that's what officers did during the deadly shooting at a Louisville bank Monday.   Humphrey commended Wilt's bravery. Wilt was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the bank.  ""Officer Wilt was a brand new officer, he had no experience. He was going based on two things: his training and his character. And you will see that he never hesitates — even after getting shot at — this young man went back in to the line of fire in order to protect others, and you're going to see that and how he made his decisions and how they ultimately protected other people's lives,"" Humphrey said.  ##Victims## Several minutes of police body camera video from the deadly bank shooting in Lousiville, Kentucky, shows the bravery of the responding officers, the department's Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwynn-Villaroel said. ""These officers unflinchingly answered the call to protect and their duty to serve. They confronted acts of violence head-on and neutralized the threat,"" she said at a news conference ahead of a presentation of the video. The chief said moving forward, it is time for healing and compassion, but added that officers will remain ""prepared to face and conquer"" future threats. Police previously said officers arrived at the bank three minutes after being notified of the shooting. Three officers were injured, and one had to have brain surgery, officials said. Louisville officials are releasing bodycam footage of Monday's deadly bank shooting and will show it at a news briefing happening now.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, the six to seven minutes of bodycam footage will show multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting.  In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Louisville mayor told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of the shooting on Tuesday.  Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the Louisville bank on Monday, is a volunteer firefighter and is active with the LaGrange Fire and Rescue Department, according to the department's chief Jim Sitzler.  He has volunteered with the department since 2016,  “He also worked for Oldham county dispatch as a dispatch and EMS,"" Sitzler told CNN, who described him as an asset to the department.  Sitzler said public service is in Wilt’s DNA.  The rookie police officer is still in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Sitzler said.  ""They have him sedated. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It’s just a wait and see,"" Sitzler said. ""Hopefully, he will recover enough where he can go to rehab."" ##Victims## Body camera footage from officers responding to the Louisville bank shooting is expected to be released Tuesday evening, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. A video package will be played and discussed at a 5 p.m. ET news conference, the mayor said.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, six to seven minutes of bodycam footage showing multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting will be released.  Greenberg said the video “will focus on the interactions between the shooter and police"" and that it will be “respectful” in terms of sensitivity toward victims. The video will then be uploaded to a YouTube page for distribution. 911 calls related to the incident are not expected to be released Tuesday, the police department's public information officer, Matthew Sanders told CNN.  Body camera footage showing the confrontation between police and the gunman who killed five people at a Louisville bank is expected to be released Tuesday evening.   Meantime, police are uncovering new details about the shooter. The department's chief said that the gun used in the attack was purchased less than a week ago. Here's what to know to get up to speed: Timeline: The entire incident lasted about 9 minutes, Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said. The shooting began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, according to a manager at the bank. The shooter fired his weapon for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived, according to a city official. When officers got there, they shot and killed the gunman, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department.
            The weapon: The shooter used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, which was purchased six days ago, police said. He bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Police also said they executed a search warrant on his house and recovered some other items. Gwinn-Villaroel would not specify what they were.
            Video of the shooting: The responding officer's body camera footage is expected to be released Tuesday evening, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Police also said the shooter live-streamed the incident on Instagram. Meta, the parent company of the platform, said that video was taken down. A city official said investigators are in possession of the video.
            Dispatcher audio: A Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. ""He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" the dispatcher said, according to Broadcastify audio.
            Victims: The five victims were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; James Tutt, 64, and Deana Eckert, 57. 
            Hospital response: Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer, said his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. He credited the Red Cross and blood donations with saving lives. On Tuesday, four patients were still at the University of Louisville Hospital, a spokesperson said. The rookie officer who was shot in the head remains sedated in the intensive care unit, Smith said.
            Calls for action: Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, and he made a plea for the state and federal governments to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political. Smith said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow ""weary.""
            Vigil planned: A local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of the shooting and unite as a community, the mayor said. ##Catch Up## A majority of adults or their family members in the United States have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over half of US adults, 54%, have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by such an incident, such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or been injured or killed by a gun. Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. The new report came less than a day after a shooter killed five people in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured. About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot. Read more about the survey.  Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead.  During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was ""neutralized"" approximately three minutes after police responded.  ""It's about a nine-minute span from the time he begins his assault,"" Cromwell said. ""And then there's a few minutes after that, before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that, when we respond to the scene. And then about three minutes after, we respond, the subject is neutralized.""  Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.  Louisville Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a ""targeted"" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police.  Authorities said a third officer was injured as a result of the incident, but not from a gunshot wound. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report.   The Louisville Metro Police Department has opened two separate investigations following Monday's shooting at Old National Bank — one under the purview of homicide and another under the scope of its Public Integrity Unit, a police official said. ""Because of the complexity of the scene, we had made the determination yesterday to segment the internal shooting — where between the shooter and the employees, a homicide investigation — and then the Public Integrity Unit will be the external shooting incident, which was between the suspect and the officers,"" Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said at a news conference Tuesday. ""So there's two separate investigations going. Local Metro Police will be handling the Public Integrity Unit and the homicide investigation."" How the events unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. The officer is sedated in the intensive care unit, Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, said at Tuesday's news conference. CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report. Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow ""weary."" Smith said that his hospital ""barely had to adjust our operating room schedule"" on Monday because that's ""how frequent we are having to deal with gun violence in our community."" ""I'll tell you personally, I'm weary. I've been in Louisville for 15 years, all of it at University Hospital for 15 years, I've cared for victims of violence and gunshot wounds. And people say, 'I'm tired,' but I'll be honest, it's more than tired. I'm weary.""  He continued: ""There's only so many times you can walk into a room. And tell someone they're not coming home tomorrow. And it just breaks your heart. When you hear someone screaming, 'Mommy' or 'Daddy.' It just becomes too hard day in and day out to be able to do that."" Watch here: Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political.  ""We need policies in place that will keep this from happening again so that thoughts and prayers do not have to be offered to get another community ripped apart by the savage violence coming from guns,"" McGarvey said in a Tuesday briefing.  ""I had somebody tell me the other day. Don't make this political.  Fine. Don't make this political. People's lives aren't political. Public safety isn't political. Put those policies in place that put people first. People over guns, kids over guns, public safety over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem,"" McGarvey added.  McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove fire arms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks.  ""We can do this. We can come together at the federal level, working with each other to solve this problem, which is impacting all of us in a uniquely American way,"" he said.  He then called out the Republicans for working harder on identify politics than on gun reform.  McGarvey said things like getting ""weapons of war off our streets"" and ""helping people who are in crisis"" are not a ""political issue,"" but ""it becomes one when Kentucky Republicans would rather ban books and pronouns and then make Kentucky a sanctuary state for weapons."" ""We are hurting. And no matter what policy we passed, no, it will not bring back these people,"" he added.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city.  ""That level of gun violence is beyond horrific,"" he said in a Tuesday briefing.  ""We have to take action now. We need short-term action to end this gun violence epidemic now so fewer people die on our streets, and in our banks, and in our schools and in our churches. And for that, we need help. We need help from our friends in Frankfurt and help from our friends in Washington, DC.,"" the mayor said.   ""This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. You may think this will never happen to you, never happen to any of your friends or loved ones. I used to think that. The sad truth is that now no one in our city, no one in our state, no one in our country has that luxury anymore,"" he continued. As a Democratic candidate for mayor, Greenberg was the target of a shooting at his campaign headquarters. ""Last year, I survived a workplace shooting. And now yesterday, I've lost a very close friend in another workplace shooting,"" the mayor said.  Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence.  ""Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how we reduce gun violence in our city,"" he said.  The man who opened fire at a Louisville bank, killing five people, purchased the weapon he used in the attack six days ago, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the shooter bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4. ""We have executed a search warrant on his residence, and we have recovered items and we cannot get into specific details on what we recover[ed] at this time, because again the investigation is ongoing,"" she added Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said the shooter used an AR-15 rifle in the shooting.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said a local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of Monday's bank shooting and unite as a community.  ""This vigil will be to acknowledge the wounds, physical and emotional, that gun violence leaves behind. It will be an interfaith opportunity for our entire community, to come together, to grieve, to heal, to begin to move forward,"" Greenberg said.    The Louisville Metro Police Department will release body-worn camera footage of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank on Tuesday afternoon, Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel announced. ""We also would like to share that later on this afternoon, we will be releasing body-worn camera footage of the incident. And so that information at the time will be released to you and the location. So everyone will be privy to that information,"" she said at a news conference Tuesday morning. Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said that his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. Smith thanked the American Red Cross and their organization's efforts in getting the hospital additional blood needed for treatment.  He said the blood needed ""far outstrips"" the hospital's capacity and credited the Red Cross's efforts with helping to save lives. Louisville officials are holding a briefing now on Monday's fatal workplace shooting and the latest on the investigation.  The release about the briefing said officials will “provide updates on the aftermath of Monday’s shooting and announce a planned vigil.” Here's who we expect to speak at the briefing: Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg

            Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer of UofL Health An additional patient was discharged from UofL Hospital on Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. Out of the nine patients originally hospitalized:  Four have been discharged
            Four remain in the hospital
            One has died One of the four patients in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, according to the hospital spokesperson. CNN reported Monday that a fifth victim had died later in the day. CNN also reported that a rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago –  underwent brain surgery after being shot in the head, police said Monday.  The interim police chief told CNN Tuesday morning that the officer was still in critical condition, but stable. Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, later added at a news conference that the officer is sedated in the intensive care unit. James “Jim” Tutt, one of the victims of Monday's Old National Bank shooting, was a “huge fan and supporter” of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN.  Tutt was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation since 2018 and recently served as treasurer, according to Fleischaker.  The nonprofit organization works on improving the Louisville downtown area by promoting redevelopment, vitality, economic growth, and a safe environment, according to their website. “Jim was very helpful to me as I started my role with Louisville Downtown Partnership last year and had an 'open-door policy' with taking any call or question,” Fleischaker said. “Jim will be deeply missed.” Tutt, who was 64 and a native of Frankfort, Kentucky, worked as the commercial real estate (CRE) market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, his LinkedIn shows. “The Louisville Downtown Partnership staff send our love and heartfelt condolences to his wife and family as well as his Old National family, for enduring what should be the unthinkable,” Fleischaker said. ##Victims## Body camera footage of the police response to the Louisville shooting will be released within the next 24 to 48 hours, according to Kevin Trager, spokesperson at the mayor’s office. He also said the footage will not be released at the upcoming 11:30 a.m. ET briefing with officials   The Louisville Metro Police Department is planning a meeting Tuesday to go over what videos might be released related to Monday's shooting at Old National Bank. The department will also discuss the process of showing the videos to the families so they can view them first before they are released to news organizations, according to a law enforcement source. Police intend to release the videos before this evening, and there could be an evening news conference, the source said. Five patients are still being treated at University of Louisville Hospital on Tuesday, with one patient upgraded from critical to fair condition, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. One of the five patients is still in critical condition, and the other four are in stable and fair condition.  Nine patients in total, including three Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers, were treated at the hospital following Monday’s shooting, the spokesperson said. Three of those patients have been discharged. Five of the nine patients sustained gunshot wounds, and one of the patients died Monday night. LMPD identified the patient who died as 57-year-old Deana Eckert. Investigators combing through Instagram video of the shooting saw firsthand the horror that unfolded Monday, watching the shooter fire his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appearing to wait a minute and a half before police arrive, according to a city official.  It’s unclear why the gunman stopped shooting.  The video shows that his attack on bank workers lasted about a minute, the official told CNN. The live stream begins with the clearly visible AR-15-style weapon before a worker inside the bank says good morning to the gunman, according to the official. “You need to get out of here,” the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the live stream, which was eventually taken down by Instagram’s parent company Meta.  According to that official, the gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can’t because the safety is on and the weapon still needed to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.  The shooter then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they try to outrun the gunman, the official said.  The shooter does not go to other floors of the bank where workers were already present, the official said.  Once the shooter was done firing, he sat down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street and appears to wait for police, the official said. The gunman waited roughly a minute and a half before police arrived and engaged the shooter in the gun battle, according to the official.    Authorities ""will make every effort"" to release body camera and surveillance footage of the bank shooting ""as soon as possible,"" Louisville Metro Police spokesperson Aaron Ellis said. “We are still in the infancy of this investigation,” he added. A spokesperson for the Louisville mayor also told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank later Tuesday.  The mayor has seen the surveillance footage, the spokesperson said.  “It’s clear the initial responding officers immediately engaged the shooter,” the spokesperson said, adding the officers undoubtedly saved lives and noting there were other people in the building. Separately, a Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman, identified as Connor Sturgeon, had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. ""He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" the dispatcher said in the audio, according to Broadcastify audio. Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (or 800-273-8255) to connect with a trained counselor or visit the NSPL site. CNN's Michelle Watson contributed reporting to this post.  Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan and other members of the bank’s leadership team are in Louisville Tuesday to provide support to individuals affected by Monday's mass shooting, according to a statement from the bank, which adds that they will continue to be there in the days ahead. “There are no words to adequately describe the sadness and devastation that our Old National family is experiencing as we grieve the tragic loss of our team members and pray for the recovery of all those who were injured,” Ryan wrote in a Monday statement to CNN. ""Obviously, this is an incredibly difficult situation, and our entire focus is on making sure that everyone affected has the support and assistance they need,"" the CEO’s statement reads. “On behalf of everyone at Old National, I also want to acknowledge and thank Louisville law enforcement, the medical community and state and local officials for their incredible response to this tragedy. And finally, we ask you to please continue to pray for all those affected.” The shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, the bank manager, said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. “Just a very traumatic phone call to get,” Goodlett told the affiliate, adding that he has since seen his wife and she is OK. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police officials said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. Wilt underwent brain surgery and was in critical but stable condition as of Monday afternoon, the chief said. The gun used in the shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The semi-automatic rifle is the most popular sporting rifle in the US, and 30% of gun owners reported having owned an AR-15 or similar-style rifle, according to the 2021 National Firearms Survey. The AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago. The bank sits on the fringe of Louisville’s developing downtown business district, state Sen. Gerald Neal, who represents the district where the shooting happened, told CNN.  CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report. ##Catch Up## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg praised his community after a bank shooting Monday that left five people dead. In a CNN interview alongside Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, Greenberg — who said he himself is a survivor of gun violence in the workplace — encouraged those impacted by the shooting to ""take time with loved ones."" The mayor said his friend Tommy Elliott, who was killed in the shooting, was a ""great friend"" and ""the definition of loyalty."" Elliott was also a friend to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and others around the city, he said.  He recounted having not known whether another friend had survived yesterday's attack. The mayor said when he saw his friend in the hospital, he was overwhelmed. ""We both survived,"" the mayor said he told his friend, encouraging him to see a therapist and talk to professionals. While the mayor said he doesn’t personally know the others who died, from the stories he has heard, ""they are wonderful as well."" ""We must work together to end this plague of gun violence in this country. Enough,"" he said. In an interview with CNN, Louisville's interim police chief offered few further details about the developing investigation into the fatal workplace shooting at a downtown bank in the Kentucky city, revealing that the gunman recently purchased the weapon used in the shooting without providing any more information. Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel confirmed that police searched the suspect's home Monday, adding she hopes the items that were recovered will help shed light on the motive. She did not say whether any other search warrants were executed. Asked about a note the shooter wrote indicating he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank, the interim chief said the investigation was in preliminary stages. “We will actually reveal that information, but I want to make sure that I don’t misspeak,” she continued, adding that the victims' families and the public deserve accuracy, promising more details to come.  She said that Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head while responding to the shooting, was in critical but stable condition and “looking better.” Wilt graduated from the police academy less than two weeks ago. She asked for prayers for him and the families of others who lost their lives to “senseless” violence. Meta, the parent company of Instagram, confirmed that they took down a live-stream video of the Louisville bank shooting. ""We are in touch with law enforcement and quickly removed the live stream,"" a Meta spokesperson said.  Meta declined to comment if the video was taken down on its own or at the request of law enforcement.  Sources previously told CNN that the shooting was live streamed on Instagram and has been take down but not immediately after the shooting.   Police are in possession of the video, according to the source. The mass shooting at the Old National Bank on East Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky, began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN. She watched from her computer as her coworkers were gunned down. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that,” Buchheit-Sims said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.  “Just kind of a monotone personality,” she said of Sturgeon. “His temperament is pretty low key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed.” President Joe Biden spoke over the phone with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Monday evening about the bank shooting yesterday in Louisville, the White House said. He had earlier condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. At least five people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and he wrote a note that indicated that he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.
            Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
            Investigation: Police did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about him. The gunman live streamed the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down.
            Victims: Four of the victims who died Monday were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim – 57-year-old Deana Eckert – also died. Several victims remain hospitalized, including a police officer in critical condition after a shootout with the gunman.
            Reaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and state Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov. Andy Beshear said one of the victims, Tommy Elliot, was ""one of my closest friends"" and that the community will also mourn and miss all of the other victims. ##Catch Up##",0

314,"Russians fear a second wave of mobilization, as Putin prepares to make it harder to avoid a military call-up","When Vladimir Putin tried to mobilize hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in his invasion of Ukraine last September, chaos, fear and anger reverberated through Russia. For many, those feelings returned on Wednesday after the Russian parliament approved a law that made the country's conscription program more efficient, more modern -- and harder to evade. ""We have been expecting the second mobilization wave for a long time now, and this is the beginning,"" Irina, a 51-year-old psychologist whose son is of mobilization age, told CNN from Moscow. ""These amendments have already had their effect on me, by contributing to a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety."" The new bill -- passed by lawmakers on Wednesday, and awaiting only Putin's signature before it becomes law -- is, according to the Kremlin, an unremarkable streamlining of Russia's biannual conscription process. It would allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers, in addition to traditional letters, and bans those liable for military service from traveling abroad. It also includes tough penalties for those who ignore a summons -- barring them from getting a loan, moving into a new apartment, registering as self-employed and driving a vehicle. But CNN spoke to a number of Russians who dismiss the Kremlin's reassurances, and say the move lays the groundwork for another attempt to force Russians onto the battlefields in Ukraine. ""This is the second wave,"" Irina said. ""Of course, they have to feed this war with fresh meat all the time. ""During the first wave they used police raids to round up conscripts. People didn't like that. So now they are trying to concoct something different,"" she said. ""This may well be an attempt to avoid the full-scale manhunt they employed before, which caused so much panic,"" added Artem, 25, who dodged the September mobilization despite receiving a call-up. ""I am not at all convinced these measures will help to avoid a rampant mobilization like in autumn last year."" But he is certain of one thing: if another attempt at mass mobilization arrives, he will not comply. ""My relatives, not fit for army service, can drive my car if they take away my license,"" he said. ""I don't own any real estate. And the traveling ban has more of a psychological effect on me than practical -- or I would have left long ago."" He is confident his friends and family would take a similar approach. ""It will prompt them to take more measures to dodge. Some will leave, others -- move to their country homes, still others -- forge their documents,"" he said. ""Everyone will have to find some ways around this somehow. ""None of the people I know -- my friends and aquaintances will go to conscription centers,"" concurred Irina. ""They will employ anything to avoid getting there,"" she said. ""It's better to be sent to prison than be killed."" 'I don't believe a word' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that the new bill is meant only to ""fix the mess"" that followed September's controversial partial mobilization order. It was a rare admission of failure that reflected how damaging that initial effort was. The order was beset by issues, and prompted thousands of Russians to flee to the border. Asked during a regular call with reporters if the Kremlin is concerned that the impending new law would trigger another wave of mass exodus of Russians, Peskov said: ""Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with mobilization, it has to do with military registration."" ""I don't believe a word of this,"" Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN. While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to their own guidelines when calling up recruits. ""Now it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become,"" he said.  Currently, conscription documents in Russia must be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer. The new bill makes an electronic summons -- uploaded to a government portal called Gosuslugi -- equal to the traditional method, and does not take into account whether it has been read. Russia's Defense Ministry routinely conscripts men for compulsory military service twice a year, in spring and autumn. The spring conscription this year will apply to 147,000 citizens aged between 18 and 27 and will take place from April 1 to July 15, according to an official document published by the government. Officials say the changes are related to this process, which was ongoing in Russia before it invaded Ukraine last year. But the memories of September are felt intensely among young men and families around the country. ""I have no trust in today's authorities in Russia. I fear for my son even more than about my own life,"" said Alexey, whose son falls within the official age range for conscription. Is another exodus possible? The prospect of leaving Russia has been a realistic one for many who oppose the war, and who have avoided or fear a call-up.  ""Should (the war) drag on and intensify, and if there is a real second wave of mobilization, then I think some will try to leave (Russia), of course,"" said Olga, a 48-year-old woman who fears her son, who is 16, will be sent to fight in the coming years, disrupting his plans for higher education. ""I feel very badly about this war. And same goes for all other wars and any deaths by force regardless of the cause,"" she said. ""I would prefer for wars to be fought only by professional military or volunteers. But fleeing is a difficult proposition. Artem told CNN he is exploring the possibility, but sees few options and fears being unable to find work abroad. ""I do not rule out leaving Russia but I don't see how, if they impose the ban on draft dodgers traveling abroad,"" added Irina. ""I don't see a solution here."" ""And even if it were possible, finding work and accommodation abroad is not so simple. Many of those who had left in autumn last year had returned,"" she said. ""But, of course, I would feel much better had my son been living in another country. My daughter had left two years ago and I worry about her much less than I would, had she been here."" Though the Kremlin has been quick to downplay the significance of the move, its provisions and timing are convenient for a military bogged down in stalemate in its ground campaign in eastern Ukraine, after months of grinding combat which has bled their manpower and weaponry. Western officials last week told CNN they believe Russia has a problem generating ""trained military manpower.""  ""[Russia has] acknowledged that they needed 400,000 more troops and that's not just for the conflict [in Ukraine], but also to fulfill new formations which are going to be put on the new border with NATO and Finland,"" the officials said in a briefing on Wednesday, answering a question from CNN. ""How they generate that is unclear at the moment,"" the officials added, noting that a new wave of call-ups would pose risks for Moscow. ""Whether the population can sustain another round of mobilization and whether the Kremlin actually wants to test the population's resilience to that it is unclear at the moment, but the fact they haven't done would indicate to us that they have some concerns about that."" The war appears to remain generally popular in Russia -- a sentiment reinforced by relentless propaganda on state-controlled media outlets -- but analysts have noted that September's mobilization order was a turning point for many Russians, bringing the realities of conflict home to families across the country. For those who oppose the conflict, it only hardened their opposition. ""Is it the second wave? (It) seems very much so,"" Artem said. ""But any wave of mobilization is intended to supply the front with more meat."" Summing up his feelings, and referring to Putin by his first and middle names, he added: ""Try and recall all of the most eloquent obscenities you know ... that would be my view on the war, the draft and everything to do with Vladimir Vladimirovich's system of governing.""",0
315,"Inside Al-Aqsa, Muslims say they're losing control of the holy site","On the grounds of the Al-Aqsa complex, one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism, a delicate balance that governs this holy site is under strain.     Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the sacred grounds known to them as Al Haram Al Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as Temple Mount under a status quo arrangement originally reached more than a century ago. Non-Muslim visitors are allowed visits at certain times and only to certain areas of the complex.      But many in the Muslim world fear the right to be the sole worshipers at the holy site is slowly being eroded by a growing far-right Jewish movement.    The complex lies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be occupied territory. Israel captured it from Jordan in a 1967 war and considers both East and West Jerusalem as its united, ""eternal capital.""    It is the complex where Israeli police conducted violent raids twice in less than 24-hours last week. Videos shared on social media showed Israeli police beating screaming Muslim worshipers with batons. Police said they stormed the mosque itself after ""hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators barricaded themselves"" inside, throwing fireworks and stones at them.    The violence prompted rocket fire from southern Lebanon and Gaza that Israel blamed on Palestinian militants. Israel retaliated with airstrikes.   Two Muslim-born CNN journalists were given permission to report from the compound by the Jordanian custodians of the site.   The compound was relatively calm when CNN visited Tuesday. At the gates of Al-Aqsa mosque, the main mosque in the compound, a group of women recited the Quran ahead of afternoon prayers. It has been a tumultuous Ramadan and Tuesday brought more tensions.    ""I feel pain. True pain deep inside,"" Um Kamal Al-Kurdi, a Palestinian resident of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem told CNN on Tuesday morning. ""This is a house of God. It is for worship. Not for occupation or provocation. Even as we pray, we are provoked and monitored by the Israelis.""       As al-Kurdi spoke, a group of mostly Jewish visitors walked past, escorted by heavily armed Israeli police. One officer filmed the group of women as they began reciting the Quran louder and louder. A raised voice in recitation was their only form of protest in this brief but tense moment.      By Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced it would prohibit non-Muslims from entering the holy site for the rest of Ramadan. The decision isn't unprecedented, but his far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said in a statement that it was ""a serious mistake that will not bring peace, but may only escalate the situation.""     The compound consists of large open courtyards as well as the Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.  The mosque and dome are built on top of the site where Jews believe their first and second temples stood, and is known as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism. The Western Wall is believed to be part of the second temple complex, and sits below the courtyard. It is the site that Jew face in prayer.     Most leading Rabbis say Jews should not step foot on the site. But a growing movement of Jewish extremists has been campaigning to be allowed to perform prayers on the grounds, a call that could upend the status quo arrangement that governs the management of the site. CNN witnessed at least two Jewish worshippers praying without being stopped or removed by police.      Ben Gvir is a vocal advocate of Jewish prayer at the site. Once considered the fringe of Israeli politics, having been previously convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, his visit to the compound earlier this year drew international condemnation.    Jordan's Hashemite monarchy is the custodian of the complex, based on an agreement that dates back to 1924, and it manages the site under an Islamic trust called the Waqf. But Jordan's role is becoming increasingly symbolic, experts say, because it is Israel that controls the security checks at entry points and therefore access to the sacred grounds. Tourists can enter during visiting hours on their own, but religious Jews are often escorted by heavily armed guards.      Sheikh Azzam Khatib, the director general of the Waqf, sees these increasing visits of Jewish groups under Israeli police escort as a provocation to Palestinians and the wider Muslim word.      ""I see these visits as a raid on our holy site,"" he said. ""Israel should keep its hands off the mosque and the compound because this is a violation (of the sanctity of the site) ... and can lead to events that cannot be contained.""     The status quo itself is an unwieldly subject, fraught with debate. It is not a traditional treaty signed by the various parties during some ceremony, instead built on historical precedents dating back to the Ottoman Empire, amended and agreed upon by various bodies from the British, to the United Nations and beyond. That status quo is slowly being chipped away, says Sheikh Rani Abusibr, an Imam of nearly twenty-years at Al-Aqsa.      ""History is always written by the powerful,"" Abusibr said. ""Of course, it is expected that if there is no force to stand-up against this encroachment then our rights can easily be lost.""     Some Jewish extremist calls go beyond the demand for prayer. Far-right fringe movements want to see a third Jewish temple built at the site. On the day of CNN's visit, small groups of Jewish radicals taunted Muslims by singing ""The Temple will be built"" at the gates of the compound.      Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that he is committed to maintaining the status quo, but under his government, the most far-right in Israeli history, extremist voices are growing louder and stronger.      For the wider Arab world, al-Aqsa is seen as the last enclave of Muslim control in the heart of East Jerusalem. CNN spoke to Muslim worshippers at the site who only gave their first names citing security concerns.   ""Al-Aqsa is ours. No matter what anyone says. Al-Aqsa is ours even it was raided by a million people,"" Mohammed, a worshipper at the site, told CNN. ""It is an ideology that we carry in our minds.""      Some Palestinian worshippers must go to great lengths to reach the mosques at the complex, particularly visitors from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who generally need to obtain travel documents from Israeli authorities and can undergo lengthy waits at checkpoints and multiple security checks.      Without the status quo arrangement being enforced, there are fears that an already tumultuous region could spiral out of control. Any perceived shift in the norms can -- and has -- set-off cycles of deadly violence. But these periodic flare-ups have always fallen back on the simple understanding that has maintained some semblance of order in one of the most contentious corners of the world.      ""Of course, I don't feel safe. Everything can change in an instant, so I am always scared,"" said Noor, a worshipper inside the Dome of the Rock, the golden-domed shrine that is seen in the holy city's skyline. ""But I am here because I have faith in God.""",0

318,Fed official: Central bank should be 'cautious' in wake of banking turmoil,"The banking crisis could help the Federal Reserve's fight to bring down inflation, but the central bank needs to be ""cautious"" in its actions moving forward, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Tuesday.  Goolsbee, the newest Fed appointee, spoke before the Economic Club of Chicago and addressed the ""new, big, hairy elephant in the room"" that was the recent failure of two regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and subsequent market turmoil. ""At moments of financial stress like this, the right monetary policy is really caution and watchfulness and prudence,"" he said. ""And I don't say that because I think we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation just because markets got upset."" But instead of financial issues trumping monetary policy concerns, financial conditions should certainly be included in monetary policy discussions, Goolsbee said.  ""History has taught us that in moments of financial stress, even if they don't escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting monetary policy,"" he said.  Currently, he added, there's not conflict between monetary policy and potentially tightening credit conditions. They would work in tandem to cool inflation, he said.  Still, Goolsbee added, the Fed needs to be ""on watch"" for the possibility of tighter credit conditions. ""If the response to these banking problems leads the financial industry to tighten on its own, that monetary policy has to do less,"" he said. ""It's not clear yet, exactly how much less."" He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the recent turmoil equates to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three quarters of a point. ""Given how much uncertainty abounds when these financial headwinds are going, I think we need to be cautious,"" he said. ""We should gather further data and we should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are going for us in getting inflation down."" Goolsbee said the foremost pieces of data he'll be looking for in advance of the Fed's next meeting in early May will be about how much credit tightening is occurring.",0
319,"Leon Levine, discount store pioneer, dies at 85","Leon Levine, who built Family Dollar into a discount retail giant catering to America's lower-income and middle-class shoppers, has died at 85. The Leon Levine Foundation, the philanthropic organization Levine later founded, confirmed in an online statement he died on April 5. No cause was listed. Levine, a college dropout, was one of several retail founders who ushered in a boom of stores selling low-cost goods. Discount stores have thrived in recent decades as the income gap in the United States has widened. Three dollar store chains — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — are now the fastest-growing US retailers. Levine opened the first Family Dollar store in 1959 at age 22 in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his cousin. The store sold clothing, cleaning supplies and essentials for under $2. Family Dollar grew around the rural South and by 1969 had 50 stores. The company went public in 1970, the same year as Walmart. Levine found a niche appealing to lower-income customers in mostly rural areas. He would look for new store locations by driving around and checking supermarket parking lots. Fresh oil spots on the pavement meant the locals drove older cars and didn't have much money for repairs, the Charlotte Observer reported in 2004. Levine's Family Dollar bucked a trend in retail at the time toward building large stores in the fast-growing suburbs. Instead, the company opted for locations the size of convenience stores close to shoppers' homes. During the 1970s and 1980s, as department stores like Sears opened in malls and Walmart was beginning to build large superstores, Family Dollar built small stores in neighborhood strip malls.  Stores were typically 6,000 to 8,000 square feet and were easy for quick visits. ""We're just the opposite of a Wal-Mart,"" Family Dollar president George Mahoney told the Associated Press in 1993. ""Our customers don't want the hassle of shopping in a huge store, or they lack the funds to shop there."" By 1993, Family Dollar had 2,000 stores. A decade later, when Levine retired from Family Dollar, the company had around 4,500 stores. (Today, there are more than 8,000 Family Dollar stores. Dollar Tree bought the chain in 2015 for nearly $9 billion.) After he retired from Family Dollar, Levine became one the largest philanthropists in the South, donating hundreds of millions of dollars to universities, hospitals and Jewish organizations.",0
320,The most-wanted clothing brands at resale are probably hanging in your closet,"Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, step aside. Resale clothing shoppers are bypassing previously-owned luxury brands at discounted prices in favor of scoring secondhand mid-tier brands for less. More affordable brands, such as Madewell, Zara, Urban Outfitters, Free People, Anthropologie, Abercrombie & Fitch and Levi's are now the most popular brands with the best resale value, according to a new joint annual industry report from ThredUp, the world's largest online thrift and consignment platform, and research and analytics firm GlobalData. Re-worn clothing is a fast-growing market overall that's expected to reach $70 billion in sales by 2027, from sales of $44 billion in 2023, the report said. As many as 75% of consumers have shopped, or are open to shopping, for secondhand clothing -- and demand has only grown during the pandemic.  Among value-and-sustainability focused Gen Zers, the affinity for purchasing clothing that isn't new is particularly strong, with 83% of younger shoppers having shopped or open to buying secondhand clothing, according to the report.  James Reinhart, CEO of ThredUp, said difficult macro-economic factors, including persistent inflation in consumer goods, has helped drive more momentum in the marketplace. At the same time, he said inflation has also pushed up prices even for secondhand goods. ""Prices are up broadly just as they are everywhere else in retail,"" he said. In this environment, he said secondhand shoppers are hyper-focused on value, especially when buying clothes, and mid-tier brands are sitting in this sweetspot. Among those brands, the report showed 30% of the top 20 offer their own resale programs.  Neil Saunders, a managing director with GlobalData, said traditional retailers are responding to demand by entering the resale segment and are really the ones driving the market forward. ""We expect increased adoption in retail as secondhand becomes more of a lifestyle for consumers,"" he said. The reports said many as 88 brands launched their own dedicated resale programs last year, a 244% increase from 2021. ThredUp competitor Poshmark said mid-tier brands like Nike, Free People, Zara and J. Crew were some of the most sought-after labels in March on its platform. ""In an often luxury-filled environment, there used to be somewhat of a stigma surrounding wearing mid-tier brands, but it's now more of a flex to say your low-rise cargo pants are from J. Crew than it is to say you're wearing a Prada backpack,"" said Chloe Baffert, merchandising and curation expert at Poshmark She said affordable, mass market brands are revamping their styles and are effectively leveraging social media to show how they're staying more in tune with the latest trends.  ""It's a bragging right [for consumers] to say you're on trend and within budget,"" she said.",0
321,IMF: Banking crisis boosts risks and dims outlook for world economy,"At the start of the year, economists and corporate leaders expressed optimism that global economic growth might not slow down as much as they had feared. Positive developments included China's reopening, signs of resilience in Europe and falling energy prices. But a crisis in the banking sector that emerged last month has changed the calculus. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecasts for the global economy Tuesday, noting ""the recent increase in financial market volatility."" The IMF now expects economic growth to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. Its estimate in January had been for 2.9% growth this year. ""Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled,"" the organization said in its latest report. Fears about the economic outlook have increased following the failures in March of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, two regional US lenders, and the loss of confidence in the much-larger Credit Suisse, which was sold to rival UBS in a government-backed rescue deal. Already, the global economy was grappling with the consequences of high and persistent inflation, the rapid rise in interest rates to fight it, elevated debt levels and Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, concerns about the health of the banking industry join the list. ""These forces are now overlaid by, and interacting with, new financial stability concerns,"" the IMF said, noting that policymakers trying to tame inflation while averting a ""hard landing,"" or a painful recession, ""may face difficult trade-offs."" Global inflation, which the IMF said was proving ""much stickier than anticipated,"" is expected to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% this year and to 4.9% in 2024. Changing forecasts Investors are looking for additional pockets of vulnerability in the financial sector. Meanwhile, lenders may turn more conservative to preserve cash they may need to deal with an unpredictable environment. That would make it harder for businesses and households to access loans, weighing on economic output over time. ""Financial conditions have tightened, which is likely to entail lower lending and activity if they persist,"" said the IMF, which hosts its spring meeting alongside the World Bank this week. If another shock to the world's financial system results in a ""sharp"" deterioration in financial conditions, global growth could slow to 1% this year, the IMF warned. That would mean ""near-stagnant income per capita."" The group put the probably of this happening at about 15%. The IMF acknowledged forecasting was difficult in this climate. The ""fog around the world economic outlook has thickened,"" it said. And it warned that weak growth would likely persist for years. Looking ahead to 2028, global growth is estimated at 3%, the lowest medium-term forecast since 1990.  The IMF said this sluggishness was attributable in part to scarring from the pandemic, aging workforces and geopolitical fragmentation, pointing to Britain's decision to leave the European Union, economic tensions between the United States and China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Interest rates in advanced economies are likely to revert to their pre-pandemic levels once the current spell of high inflation has passed, the IMF also said.     The body's forecast for global growth this year is now closer to that of the World Bank. David Malpass, the outgoing World Bank president, told reporters Monday that the group now saw a 2% expansion in output in 2023, up from 1.7% predicted in January, Reuters has reported. Not 2008, but... In a separate report published Tuesday, the IMF said that while the rapid increase in interest rates was straining banks and other financial firms, there were fundamental differences from the 2008 global financial crisis.  Banks now have much more capital to be able to withstand shocks. They also have curbed risky lending due to stricter regulations.  Instead, the IMF pointed to similarities between the latest banking turmoil and the US savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, when trouble at smaller institutions hurt confidence in the broader financial system. So far, investors are ""pricing a fairly optimistic scenario,"" the IMF noted in a blog based on the report, adding that access to credit was actually greater now than it had been in October.  ""While market participants see recession probabilities as high, they also expect the depth of the recession to be modest,"" the IMF said. Yet those expectations could be quickly upended. If inflation rises further, for example, investors could judge that interest rates will stay higher for longer, the group wrote in the blog.  ""Stresses could then reemerge in the financial system,"" it noted. That bolsters the need for decisive action by policymakers, the IMF said. It called for gaps in supervision and regulation to ""be addressed at once,"" citing the need in many countries for stronger plans to wind down failed banks and for improvements to deposit insurance programs. — Olesya Dmitracova contributed to this report.",0

323,"Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other major cities could face huge water cuts in feds' proposed plan to save the Colorado River","The Biden administration on Tuesday released a highly anticipated analysis of the Colorado River crisis that paints a dire picture of what that river system's collapse would portend for the West's major cities, farmers and Native tribes.  In the draft analysis, the US Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation offers two different scenarios for how to slash water usage should the levels in Lakes Mead and Powell continue to plummet, with the immediate goal of keeping enough Colorado River flowing through the Glen Canyon and Hoover dams to supply hydroelectric power to hundreds of thousands of customers.  But the implications of the analysis go far beyond hydropower.   The Colorado River provides water and electricity to more than 40 million people in seven states: Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and California. Decades of overuse, combined with years of drought worsened by the climate crisis, have spurred a sharp drop in water levels in recent years at Lakes Mead and Powell, the nation's largest reservoirs that power Hoover and Glen Canyon and provide water for drinking and agriculture to millions.  In both of the federal government's scenarios, states, farms and tribes could be forced to cut nearly 2.1 million more acre-feet of their Colorado River usage in 2024, on top of existing water-conservation agreements struck in past years.  That is an enormous amount of water, roughly 684 billion gallons and nearly equivalent to what the entire state of Arizona was expected to use from the Colorado River this year.  The Interior Department is expected to make a final decision on the cuts -- and how and when they would be implemented -- later this summer.  After an epic winter full of record-breaking snow and flooding rainfall in the West, state water officials have said the pressure is easing to find an immediate solution to the Colorado River's woes. But Deputy Interior Sec. Tommy Beaudreau told CNN that the department didn't consider this year's historic winter in its analysis. 
            
            ""While it's encouraging, it's great, the long-term trend here has been continued drought and water shortages,"" Beaudreau said. ""But there's a chance even with a good water year that it just kind of pushes the curve out a few months and we have to continue our planning process accordingly.""  What the cuts would mean for cities, farmers and tribes As pressure mounts for the federal government to come up with a fair deal for water users, Camille Calimlim Touton, the Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner, said Tuesday in a news conference that the Colorado River ""is one community comprised of 40 million people and landscapes that need us to get this right."" Touton and other officials spoke Tuesday in front of Lake Mead's dramatic bathtub ring, showing how much the water levels there have fallen. And while the extent of the water cuts is the same in the two main scenarios, the difference lies in who would bear the brunt of the cuts.  In one, major Western cities -- including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix -- would take the vast majority of the water cuts if Lake Mead levels were to plummet further, because these cities have a lower priority claim to the water, compared to farmers and Native tribes.   And it would be a major blow to those cities; 90% of Las Vegas' water supply comes from the river, while Phoenix's water supply is about 40% Colorado River water, for example.  ""For purposes of the analysis, we show what the effect would be,"" Beaudreau told CNN, adding he hopes the stark figures help spur an agreement among seven basin states.  The other scenario examines what would happen if the water cuts are spread equally among cities, farmers and tribes alike -- an option that some high-priority water users have warned could result in a prolonged, high-stakes court battle between states and the federal government.  There is also a third scenario the feds offered: Do nothing. But that is not an option states or the federal government are seriously considering as the Colorado River continues to decline.  Beaudreau called the no-action option the ""most severe"" for the river basin, but said it was important to include to emphasize why more cuts are so critical should water levels plummet further.  The federal government is trying to paint a picture that shows what a future with less water would actually look like, Beaudreau said, in hopes that sparring states can come together with a short-term agreement on cuts.   ""There has been a lot of negotiation and conversation among the states and with the Interior Department, but a lot of it's been conceptual and abstract,"" Beaudreau told CNN. ""Putting things down on paper to give direction I think will meaningfully move the conversation.""  Arizona's top water official Tom Buschatzke said the federal plan ""presents multiple paths forward, but those paths have dire consequences."" ""In some cases, it may spur opposition or even litigation,"" Buschatzke said at Tuesday's news conference. ""Instead, let us accelerate our discussions in the basin for a collaborative consensus-based outcome.""
             California's lead negotiator in the Colorado River talks, JB Hamby, echoed that sentiment, and said Arizona, California and the other states are looking to ""develop a true, seven-state consensus in the coming months -- ideally in the next 45-day period."" The two main scenarios may also not be what is finalized later this summer, as states continue to negotiate among themselves. And a third, less-severe option could ultimately emerge based on how water levels in Lakes Mead and Powell respond to this winter's rain and snow, as well as water cuts that are already being implemented across farms and cities in the Southwest, Beaudreau said.  Administration officials are incentivizing water cuts across agriculture in exchange for federal dollars. Last week, Beaudreau and other administration officials announced the first deal it signed in a series of short-term agreements to fallow water-intensive farmland and keep more water in Lake Mead. More fallowing agreements, some of which are still being negotiated, could be coming in the next few weeks.   The result of those programs could change the landscape enough by late summer that the feds could ramp down the extent of the water cuts in their final decision.  ""It all depends on how much the shortages are,"" he said. ""If there's conservation in the system that keeps water in Lake Mead, and we have to make minimal shortage reductions on top of [existing drought guidelines], that is an accomplishment in and of itself.""  A combination of those fallowing agreements and the good winter rain and snow are expected to raise elevations in Mead and Powell in the short term, which could stave off bigger cuts. State negotiators have told CNN they hope the good winter helps take some of the immediate pressure off and gives them more time to come to an agreement on water cuts.   
            Beaudreau said that while he hopes the seven states can strike a short-term deal, he doesn't yet know whether than can be achieved. If not, he reiterated Interior is prepared to act and implement cuts itself to keep the system from crashing.   ""I think this is a step towards facilitating what I hope is some consensus coming out of the basin, but it also shows at the end of the day, the [Interior] Secretary will do what's necessary and responsible to keep the system operating,"" Beaudreau said.",0
324,What we know about the gunman who opened fire at a Louisville bank,"A 25-year-old bank employee in Louisville, Kentucky, wrote a note to loved ones before heading to his job Monday morning and opening fire -- killing five people and injuring eight others, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. The gunman, identified as Connor Sturgeon, started his attack around 8:30 a.m. at Old National Bank in downtown, authorities said. He opened fire as some employees met for a morning meeting before the bank was open to the public. Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN she watched the meeting virtually and witnessed her coworkers being slain.  Buchheit-Sims described Sturgeon as ""extremely intelligent"" and others who knew him told CNN they were shocked to see the violence, which launched a massive police response in the heart of one of America's most populated cities. But prior writings by the gunman indicate he struggled to fit in before he joined the team at Old National Bank.  Sturgeon had worked at the bank for more than a year, according to his LinkedIn profile. He livestreamed his attack on Instagram, a video that has since been removed from the platform.  A law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that the assailant had been notified that he was going to be fired from the bank. But Louisville's mayor and police chief have since said otherwise, with Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel telling CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday that that there ""was no discussion about this individual being terminated"" before the massacre. Gwinn-Villaroel said he did not have ""any prior engagement"" with police.   A search warrant was executed at Sturgeon's home Monday, Gwinn-Villaroel said in an interview with CNN Tuesday morning, noting she hopes items that were recovered will help shed light on a motive.  She did not say whether any other warrants had been executed as part of the investigation. The five victims, all between the ages of 40 and 64, were identified as Joshua Barrick, Juliana Farmer, Tommy Elliott, Deana Eckert and James Tutt, police said. Gov. Andy Beshear said Elliott, a senior vice president at the bank, was one of his closest friends.  Eight others were injured, including Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old police officer who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago. Wilt was shot in the head during a confrontation with Sturgeon on Monday morning and was taken to the hospital where he underwent brain surgery, said Gwinn-Villaroel.  Shooter wrote a note before attack Sturgeon wrote a note to his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to open fire in the bank, the law enforcement source said.  It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source. Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining full time in June 2021.  Gunman was live streaming during rampage The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has since been taken down. Police are in possession of the video, according to the law enforcement source. Earlier on Monday, Gwinn-Villaroel said police were ""hopeful"" they could get the footage from the livestream taken offline.   ""I will say this, that the suspect was live streaming. And unfortunately, that's tragic. To know that that incident was out there and captured,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said.  Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN Sturgeon had a ""monotone personality. His temperament is pretty low key. I've never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed.""  Buchheit-Sims said she didn't know anything about the shooter having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as ""extremely intelligent.""  Shooter didn't show red flags, classmate says  Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said.  Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and he was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports.  A former high school classmate of Sturgeon's who knew him and his family well said he never saw any ""sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.""  ""This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,"" said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense. I can't believe it.""  Gunman wrote about difficulty fitting in In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school.  ""My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,"" the essay read. ""As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.""  The author wrote that in college, he had ""begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,"" and that he hoped to ""be more self-aware and start becoming a 'better' person.""  The gunman's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men's basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son's high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile.   A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon's alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said his son Connor inspired him to step down from the team.  ""Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,"" the article said.  This article has been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.",0
325,ChatGPT can write sermons. Religious leaders don't know how to feel about it,"The future of artificial intelligence promises technology with a human touch. But is it human enough to deliver a convincing spiritual message? Pastors and rabbis have recently discovered that ChatGPT, an AI language learning model that can spit out passable prose with just a few prompts, is not that bad at creating sermons -- a cornerstone of worship services across many religions.  Historically, these orations are based on generations of knowledge, keen textual analysis and scholarship, combined with the unique charisma and experiences of each worship leader. Sermon writing is considered an art. A divine calling, even.  Seeing a computer approximate similar works in mere seconds has led faith leaders to wrestle with an intriguing problem: Can AI replicate a truly human, spiritual message? And if it can, is the computer just that good, or does the human message need some work?  What an AI sermon sounds like In December 2022, Rabbi Joshua Franklin gave an unusual message during a service at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, New York.  ""I'm going to plagiarize a sermon,"" he told his congregation. ""And you have to guess who wrote it."" Franklin then delved into an illumination on the Parashat Vayigash, a portion of the Torah that tells the story of a reconciliation between brothers.  ""This is a powerful lesson for all of us, as it shows the importance of being willing to draw near to others even when it's difficult, in order to build intimacy and connection,"" he went on.  At the end of the roughly two minute sermon, Franklin revealed the real author to murmurs and scattered applause: ChatGPT.  ""You're clapping,"" he said. ""But I'm terrified!"" While Franklin added that he gave the language learning model a very specific prompt, and could see details in the work that wouldn't pass muster with a seasoned scholar, the experiment was received with equal parts awe and trepidation. Could the work of a faith leader -- so intimately tied to the human experience -- eventually be eclipsed by a computer?  How AI language modeling works  Popular entertainment does little to quell our human fears of an AI-generated future, one where computers achieve consciousness, ethics, souls, and ultimately humanity. In reality, artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT are just convincing mimics.  When CNN asked how it works, ChatGPT supplied the following response:  ""ChatGPT works using a deep learning algorithm called a transformer neural network. It was trained on a massive corpus of text data from the internet, books, and other sources. During training, the model learned to identify patterns in the data and use them to generate text that resembles human language."" ""The way ChatGPT creates an original response is by using a technique called language modeling,"" it continued. ""Language modeling is a task where the model is trained to predict the probability of the next word in a sentence given the previous words.""  Ultimately, the response may sound human -- maybe even human enough to satisfy a crowd expecting religious enlightenment.  Some experts say it's still evident there's something missing.  ""It lacks a soul -- I don't know how else to say it,"" Hershael York, a pastor and theology professor in Kentucky told the Associated Press.  However, because ChatGPT is ""trained on,"" or essentially fed, innumerable pieces of text, it can do some of the work of a scholar, referencing any sacred text it's trained on in a matter of seconds.  When asked what kinds of texts it would refer to for a Christian sermon, ChatGPT was at first hesitant, stating that as an AI language model, it did not ""hold personal beliefs or religious affiliations."" With a slightly altered inquiry, it provided the following:  ""When a language model like ChatGPT is asked to create a Christian sermon, it would typically rely on its training data and knowledge of Christian theology and practice. This includes a broad range of Christian texts, such as the Bible, commentaries, theological works, and books of sermons by other preachers."" ""To create a Christian sermon, the language model would typically be given a specific topic or theme to focus on,"" it continued. ""It would then search through its vast database of knowledge to find relevant information and examples related to that topic. This might involve identifying relevant Bible passages, theological concepts, and historical or cultural contexts that are related to the topic."" How a human sermon comes together  Sermon writing is a core skill for most worship leaders. Effective sermonists follow in the footsteps of celebrated faith leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Ozjasz Thon. ""The sermon has become the climactic element in a lot of denominations' services. A sermon is not simply teaching. It sets a precedent for understanding scripture correctly. And there's also this moment of exhortation, of asking what it says about our own lives,"" says Stu Strachan, an ordained Presbyterian pastor and founder of The Pastor's Workshop, a resource for Christian sermons and teachings.  ""There's also more value added to a sermon as culture becomes more secular. If churches want to grow, they have to connect their teachings to modern life and modern problems,"" he adds. In fact, sermons are so important that there is a thriving industry to provide tools to worship leaders to make the craft a little less taxing.  ""The reality is, unless you're a pastor you have no idea what it's like to be a pastor,"" Strachan tells CNN. ""It sounds obnoxious, but it's true, and it calls upon every aspect of who you are as a person. You are always on call, and more and more roles are foisted upon pastors. They're not just studying God's word, praying, visiting the congregation, they're expected to be CEO, CFO types who cast vision, manage staff, create strategic partnerships. There is a lot of burnout."" However, some methods of lessening the burdens can stretch the ethics of the position. Sermon ghostwriters aren't uncommon, and things can get dicey when a preacher doesn't disclose where they got their brilliant ideas.  ""I think some traditions value originality more than others. That being said, if you get a ghost writer, I think most pastors would heavily frown on it,"" Strachan says. ""However, from a practical money perspective, that's not something a lot of pastors can do. The average church congregation in the US is around 100 people, and the funds simply aren't there to pay someone to do that work for you."" Where AIs -- and humans --  fall short ChatGPT is free for the public to use, so it's easy to experiment with its possibilities -- and its limitations. Basic inputs like ""Write a sermon about X topic"" return basic results with very little detail or insight. The model returns more sophisticated results when the requests include detailed themes, specific text markers and the addition of common narrative devices like personal anecdotes, cultural references and quotations.  In other words, the quality of ChatGPT's output is only as good as the prompts it receives. Even then, it has some critical shortcomings: ChatGPT and other language learning models sometimes return inaccurate, incomplete or biased information; a weakness that is stated clearly on ChatGPT's interface.  Ken Sundet Jones, a professor of theology and philosophy at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, summarized the other shortcomings he's seen in an article for the Christian nonprofit 1517.  ""Even if Pastor A.I. ChatGPT were able to move beyond the sermon as a dispensation of information, it would still miss the homiletical boat because it could only operate in the realm of a hypothetical audience,"" he writes. ""There's no particularity to what it produces and, thus, no 'for you' -ness to it."" Jones argues that the fact an AI is not human, and is not burdened at its very essence by the weight of life and death, means it cannot predict nor create something to soothe the human soul.  However, spiritual nourishment is the result of preaching at its best. Surely, like any other rhetorical art, sermon writing can be a lazy, inauthentic, and impersonal pursuit even when it's also done by a human.  A Twitter user illustrated this to amusing effect when she asked ChatGPT for a devotional loaded up with Christian-ish buzzwords like ""daddy God,"" ""covet your prayers,"" ""hedge of protection,"" and ""instruments of God."" The result was chaotic salad of platitudes and vague advice.  ""I know AI is dangerous because this reads like something I absolutely would've heard from a Christian influencer this week,"" someone jokingly replied. Exercises like these have led some faith experts through another line of logic: AI sermons lack an essential humanity. If they can produce something that can pass for someone's actual message, perhaps it, too, lacks an essential humanity.  ""Creativity requires independence, insight and imagination, all abilities that ChatGPT lacks,"" writes Chaim Steinmetz of the Jewish Journal.  ""But ChatGPT is not alone in pushing platitudes and humbug; many humans do so as well. If we find that our own opinions sound a lot like ChatGPT, that is not a flaw in it. Rather, it is the product of our own failings. Like a parrot, ChatGPT forces us to hear what we actually sound like."" Regardless of what it can create, there is one more element of strong religious rhetoric that artificial intelligence knows it will always lack: an actual human to deliver the message.  ""It's worth noting that while a language model like ChatGPT can provide an approximation of a sermon, it cannot replicate the full experience of a live sermon delivered by a human preacher,"" ChatGPT said during a conversation about how it produces sermons. ""The human element of preaching, including voice inflection, emotional expression, and audience interaction, is an important part of the preaching experience that a language model cannot replicate.""",0
326,Reinstated Tennessee lawmaker Justin Jones says he'll continue to call for gun reform,"After being sworn back into the Tennessee House of Representatives, a lawmaker who was expelled just days ago over a gun control demonstration on the chamber floor said he'll continue to call for gun reform. ""The first thing I do when I walk into this building as a representative is to continue that call for commonsense gun legislation,"" Democrat Justin Jones said as he stood on the steps of the Capitol after his reinstatement Monday. Jones and another Black Democrat, Justin J. Pearson, were forced out of the Republican-controlled legislature last week, after a protest on the chamber floor spurred by the mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead.  A third Democrat who had joined them in protest, Rep. Gloria Johnson, avoided expulsion. She is White. The Nashville Metropolitan Council voted 36-0 Monday to reappoint Jones to the House of Representatives, making him once again the representative of House District 52 -- but this time in the interim. State law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held.  ""Today we are sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence,"" Jones said to a cheering crowd Monday after marching back to the Capitol. Now technically a new member, Jones said he can file 15 bills. He'll be working on gun reform legislation as soon as he returns Tuesday, he told CNN on Monday evening. Each of those bills would have to do with gun reform, he said, because ""that's what these young people are begging us to do."" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, announced Tuesday he would ask the General Assembly to strengthen the state's gun laws this session, with legislation instituting an ""order of protection law,"" which would allow officials to strip access to weapons from ""individuals who are a threat to themselves or our society.""  Regarding Jones' reinstatement, the Tennessee House Republicans released a statement on Monday, saying, ""Tennessee's constitution provides a pathway back from expulsion. Should any expelled member be reappointed, we will welcome them. Like everyone else, they are expected to follow the rules of the House as well as state law."" Jones' return ""just felt right,"" Johnson told ""CNN This Morning"" Tuesday, underscoring the need for ""young, passionate voices"" like Jones' and Pearson's who are willing to fight for their constituents.  ""It was so good to have him back in the body,"" she said, ""overwhelmingly supported by not only his district but every district in Davidson County."" Meanwhile, Pearson's still vacant District 86 seat is set to be addressed Wednesday during a Shelby County Board of Commissioners meeting in Memphis, announced Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery, who said Pearson's expulsion was ""conducted in a hasty manner without consideration of other corrective action methods."" ""To anyone who has doubted the South, anyone who's doubted the power of Tennesseans to advocate for an end to gun violence, anybody who's doubted the movement to end assault weapons -- anybody who's doubted the movement, here's your answer: The movement still lives,"" said Pearson as he stood on the steps of the Capitol alongside Jones on Monday. Pearson told CNN's John Berman that while Monday brought celebration of Jones' reinstatement, it was also another tragic day marked by a mass shooting in Louisville, Kentucky -- less than a month after the school shooting in Tennessee that prompted the lawmakers' protest. The shooting in Louisville points to a ""sobering reality that we are in that we are not doing enough to prevent gun violence,"" Pearson added. ""It's also a painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like (Speaker of the House) Cameron Sexton and the Republican party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all of the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,"" Pearson told CNN.  What happens next? Since there are more than 12 months until the next general election in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats, according to the Tennessee Constitution. No date has been set for a special election, but state law says the governor should schedule them within 55 to 60 days. It appears both Jones and Pearson qualify to run for their seats again in the special election. In the meantime, ""the legislative body of the replaced legislator's county of residence at the time of his or her election may elect an interim successor,"" the state Constitution says. Sexton, the Speaker of the House, indicated earlier Monday that he would not stand in the way of the appointments if the local governing bodies choose to send Jones and Pearson back to the chamber. ""The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats,"" a spokesperson for the speaker's office told CNN on Monday. ""Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires."" On Monday, Jones called for Sexton's resignation.  ""He is an enemy of democracy, and he doesn't deserve to be in that office of a speaker of the House any longer,"" Jones told CNN.  Johnson agreed, accusing Sexton of limiting debate on the House floor until last week, when the nation's eyes turned to watch the proceedings against Jones, Johnson and Pearson.  ""Before the hearings, we had more healthy debate on bills than I think we've ever had in three or four years on the House floor,"" she told CNN on Tuesday, ""because people were watching.""  CNN has reached out to Sexton for comment. In expelling Jones and Pearson last week, Republicans held a party-line vote to oust them, accusing them of ""knowingly and intentionally"" bringing ""disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives"" without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. While the state Constitution says members can be expelled for disorderly behavior with a two-thirds majority vote, they cannot be expelled ""a second time for the same offense.""  Expulsions were 'unconstitutional,' attorneys say Attorneys for the ousted representatives -- among them former US Attorney General Eric Holder -- sent a letter to Sexton Monday, calling their removals ""unconstitutional.""  ""Their partisan expulsion was extraordinary, illegal and without any historical or legal precedent,"" the attorneys said. Holder and attorney Scott J. Crosby -- who are representing Jones and Pearson, respectively -- urged the House to not ""compound its errors by taking any further retributive actions."" ""Any partisan retributive action, such as the discriminatory treatment of elected officials, or threats or actions to withhold funding for government programs, would constitute further unconstitutional action that would require redress,"" the letter says. The Congressional Black Caucus released a statement Monday after Jones was reinstated to his seat. ""While this is what the residents of Nashville deserve, we must recognize that Rep. Jones was reappointed to his position not because the Republican majority did the right thing, but because Rep. Jones' constituents in Nashville, joined by supporters from all over our country, peacefully voiced their concerns about the prevalence of gun violence in our communities and the ongoing assault by Republicans on our democracy,"" the statement read.",0
327,Mother of 6-year-old student who shot teacher charged with child neglect,"The mother of a 6-year-old who shot his first-grade teacher in Newport News, Virginia, in January has been indicted on charges of felony child neglect, and one count of recklessly leaving a firearm to endanger a child, a news release from the office of the Commonwealth's Attorney said Monday. The child will not be criminally charged, Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney Howard Gwynn said last month. Deja Taylor's son shot his teacher Abigail Zwerner, 25, on January 6 at Richneck Elementary School, leaving her in the hospital with gunshot wounds to her hand and chest, investigators said. The gun was purchased by Taylor and was kept on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, secured by a trigger lock, an attorney representing the family told CNN in January. The child brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said. The indictment comes after a ""thorough investigation"" from the police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's office, according to the news release. James Ellenson, one of the attorneys for the family, said in a statement Tuesday that Taylor, 26, ""has cooperated from the first day of the incident,"" and intends to turn herself in by the end of the week. ""As always, first and foremost is the continued health and wellbeing of all persons involved in the incident at Richneck Elementary School, to include both the teacher and Deja's son,"" the statement said.   The boy has an ""acute disability"" and was under a care plan which required a parent to attend school with him, though he was unaccompanied on the day of the shooting, the family has said in a statement. ""We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,"" the statement read. A lawsuit brought this month by Zwerner alleges school administrators and the school board were aware of the student's ""history of random violence"" and did not act proactively amid concerns over a firearm in the boy's possession the day of the shooting. Ellenson said last week the allegations in the lawsuit against the child and the family ""should be taken with a large grain of salt."" ""We of course continue to pray for Ms. Zwerner's complete recovery,"" Ellenson said without commenting further on the lawsuit.  In the lawsuit, which seeks $40 million in compensatory damages, an attorney for Zwerner alleges school staff and administrators at Richneck Elementary School were aware the child was violent at home and his parents refused to place him in special education classrooms. According to the court document, during the first half of the school year, the 6-year-old was required to be accompanied by a parent during the school day ""because of his violent tendencies."" But that day, school administrators ""allowed him to remain unaccompanied without a one-on-one companion during the school day,"" the complaint says. The suit also alleges the school's then-assistant principal ignored concerns and warning signs flagged by several teachers and staff members, including that the 6-year-old may have had a firearm in his possession in the hours leading up to the January 6 shooting. A guidance counselor and administrator at the elementary school said assistant principal Ebony Parker also ""forbade"" teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his ""mother would be arriving soon to pick him up,"" the complaint says. Diane Toscano, an attorney for Zwerner, said Monday the lawsuit makes it clear ""we believe the school division violated state law."" ""There were failures in accountability at multiple levels that led to Abby being shot and almost killed. Today's announcement addresses but one of those failures,"" Toscano said in an email. ""It has been three months of investigation and still so many unanswered questions remain."" The fallout from the incident was swift, drawing harsh criticism from parents and leading the school board to vote to oust Superintendent George Parker III. Ebony Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal, Briana Foster Newton, was reassigned to another school, though the district did not say where. CNN requested comment from Parker about the lawsuit but has not heard back. The circuit court has also asked to impanel a special grand jury to continue the investigation, according to the Commonwealth's Attorney's news release. ""The Special Grand Jury will investigate to determine whether additional charges against additional persons are justified by the facts and the law,"" Gwynn said in the release. ""If the Special Grand Jury determines that additional persons are criminally responsible under the law, it can return additional indictments."" In her first interview since the shooting, Zwerner told NBC in March she can't forget the look on the child's face as he aimed the gun at her. ""I remember him pointing the gun at me, I remember the look on his face,"" Zwerner said. ""I remember the gun going off."" Asked about her recovery, Zwerner said, ""I've been doing OK. It's been challenging."" ""Some days are not-so-good days where I can't get up out of bed,"" she told NBC. ""Some days are better than others where I'm able to get out of bed and make it to my appointments. But from going through what I've gone through, I try to stay positive.""",0

329,Japan to develop long-range missiles as tensions with China rise,"Japan on Tuesday announced plans to develop and build an array of advanced long-range missiles as it bolsters its defenses amid increasing tensions with neighboring China. The Japanese Defense Ministry said it had signed contracts with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) to develop and mass produce the weapons under a plan extending to 2027.  The deals, worth more than $2.8 billion, follow Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's announcement in December that he planned to boost defense spending and enable Japan to possess ""counterstrike capabilities,"" the ability to directly attack another country's territory in the event of an emergency and under specific circumstances.  In taking the new defense initiatives, Japan is bending the interpretation of its post-World War II constitution, which put constraints on its Self-Defense Forces in that they can only be used for what their name implies, defending the Japanese homeland. Under the deals, MHI will begin mass production this year on two types of already developed missiles -- ground-launched Type 12 guided missiles designed to target ships at sea and hypersonic glide missiles designed for island defense, the ministry said. Deployment of those weapons is scheduled for 2026 and 2027, it said. The Defense Ministry news release did not say how many of each missile would be acquired. Meanwhile, MHI will this year begin development of advanced versions of the Type 12 that can also be launched by aircraft and ships. Defense industry news site Janes reported that the updgraded Type 12 will have a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), five times the reach of the current version. At the same time, MHI will begin development of submarine-launched missiles that could be fired by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's fleet of conventionally powered boats. In December, Kishida instructed his defense and finance ministers to secure funds to increase Japan's defense budget to 2% of current GDP in 2027. Along with the development of Japan's own missiles, Kishida said in February the country planned to buy as many as 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States. Tomahawks can hit targets as far as 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) away. Japan's military buildup comes amid increasing tensions with China, which has been growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan while claiming the Senkaku Islands, an uninhabited Japanese-controlled chain in the East China Sea, as its sovereign territory. Meanwhile, China has been upping its military pressure on Taiwan, the self-ruled island whose security Japanese leaders have said is vital to that of Japan. Just this week, Japan scrambled fighter jets as a Chinese aircraft carrier group came within 230 kilometers (143 miles) of the southern Japanese island of Miyako while it simulated strikes on Taiwan. Chinese military exercises around Taiwan last August including the launching of ballistic missiles, some of which landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.",0

332,Some customers are complaining the new olive oil-infused Starbucks drink is making them run to the bathroom,"Starbucks is betting big on olive oil infused coffee, hoping customers will be enticed by the anomaly and the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil.  ""It is one of the biggest launches we've had in decades,"" Brady Brewer, Starbucks' chief marketing officer, told CNN. Former CEO Howard Schultz added in an interview with Poppy Harlow that it will ""transform the coffee industry,"" and be ""a very profitable new addition to the company."" But what the company may not have taken into account: Some customers say it's making them have to run to the bathroom.  ""Half the team tried it yesterday and a few ended up... needing to use the restroom, if ya know what I mean,"" a barista on the Starbucks Reddit page posted. CNN has reached out to the Redditor for comment.  It might be the sheen from the oil. Or it could be the aftertaste. Social media was swift with condemning the drink -- and the after effects. ""That oleato drink from starbs makin my stomach speak,"" one user tweeted.  Those with sensitive stomachs are already wary.  ""IBD patient here. I wouldn't touch these drinks with a ten-foot pole,"" one Redditor said.  The new platform, Oleato, rolled out in Italy in February. Each beverage -- an oat milk latte, ice shaken espresso with oat milk and a golden foam cold brew -- are made with a spoonful of oil, adding 120 calories to a drink. Select Starbucks stores in Seattle and Los Angeles and Reserves in Chicago, Seattle and New York are now serving the platform of beverages.  CNN has reached out to Starbucks for comment.  Science behind the pain Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean culture and some drink bits of olive oil in the region daily.  But the Starbucks drink has a potentially fragile combination: caffeine, which is a stimulant, and olive oil, which is a relaxant.  A 16-ounce drink has as much as 34 grams of fat, which is more than what many find in a meal, registered dietitian nutritionist Erin Palinski-Wade said. And olive oil can help soften the stool, making it easier to go the bathroom. ""If you combined high fat in a meal or in a beverage along with coffee, which already stimulates the bowels,"" Palinski-Wade said, ""that combination can cause cramping. It can cause increased mobility in the colon and therefore have that laxative effect."" Some customers said the speed at which they had to use the restroom after having the drink caught them off guard. But high fat meals take longer to digest than liquid olive oil, which will hit the digestive track faster, Palinski-Wade said. And most people in the US are drinking coffee on the go and aren't pairing the drink with any carbohydrates and fibers to negate the impact.  The benefits of olive oil are widely circulated, linked to lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease to lowering blood pressure (though the positive health outcomes could be because the Mediterranean diet replaces unhealthy fats like butter with olive oil, The New York Times reported.) ""(The drink) is not going to make somebody physically ill from the standpoint of having a negative impact on health,"" Palinski-Wade said. ""But more of that uncomfortable feeling of having to go in the bathroom or potentially cramping."" In the Mediterranean, taking a spoonful of olive oil a day is part of a daily routine. Former CEO Howard Schultz picked up this habit himself from olive oil producer Tommaso Asaro while in Sicily, Italy. ""When we got together and started doing this ritual I said to [Asaro], I know you think I'm going to be crazy, but have you ever thought of infusing a tablespoon of olive oil with Starbucks coffee?"" Schultz told CNN's Poppy Harlow. ""He thought it was a little strange."" Asaro is the chairman of United Olive Oil, through which Starbucks is sourcing its olive oil.  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly categorized olive oil.",0
333,See the Chipotle of the future,"The distinctive gas grills in Chipotle restaurants might be a thing of the past. On Tuesday, the fast casual Mexican chain unveiled an all-electric restaurant design that is completely powered by renewable energy, such as solar and wind. That means the gas grills that have become the focal point for walk-in customers are being replaced by electric systems, which are intended to help the chain achieve its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.  Noticeable changes in this new store format include rooftop solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations and biodegradable flatware and bowls. Other changes include cactus-leather chairs and artwork made from recycled rice husks. Chipotle will tweak the design based on feedback from customers and employees, the company said.  So far, two of these new locations have opened in Gloucester, Virginia and Jacksonville, Florida, with a third opening this summer in Castle Rock, Colorado. The goal is to have 100 new locations operating entirely on electricity next year, which is a small percentage of the long-sought goal of operating 7,000 locations across North America over the next several years.  The chain currently owns and operates 3,200 restaurants in the United States. Sustainability has long been a focus for Chipotle, which, along with other fast food chains, has been criticized for not being environmentally friendly. The chain is also increasing the amount of produce bought locally to cut down on fuel used during the transportation process, and is developing more vegan and vegetarian menu items. Chipotle is constantly tweaking its store designs. It's currently experimenting with designs that are smaller than its typical footprint and focuses on digital ordering so it can build new locations in urban areas where real estate is pricier.",0
334,Former Twitter executives sue company to recover over $1 million in legal fees,"Former senior executives of Twitter have sued the company in an attempt to recover more than $1 million in legal expenses incurred by responding to shareholder lawsuits, federal investigations and a congressional hearing, according to a complaint filed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court.  The lawsuit by former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, former chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde and former chief financial officer Ned Segal alleges that Twitter has failed to reimburse them for lawyers' fees in accordance with prior agreements with the company. Elon Musk fired the executives immediately after completing his acquisition of the company.   Twitter, which cut much of its public relations team last year, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The complaint was first reported by The New York Times.  According to exhibits filed with the complaint, Gadde alone spent more than $1 million preparing for her testimony in February before the House Oversight Committee, when the panel held a hearing focused on allegations that Twitter censored conservative speech. The complaint also describes legal fees linked to probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, though without disclosing many specifics of the investigations. The references to federal investigations underscore the continuing legal risk for Twitter under Musk, who is simultaneously struggling to shore up company finances while pushing a skeleton crew to make significant changes to the product. The SEC has previously probed Musk's investment in and deal to buy Twitter, including his apparent delay in disclosing his large ownership stake in the social media company. And last month, the Federal Trade Commission acknowledged a wide-ranging investigation into Twitter's privacy practices. The Justice Department has not previously confirmed any investigation into the company. The lawsuit outlines some details about the DOJ and SEC probes. It claims that Agrawal and Segal first began receiving requests from US officials around July of last year. Agrawal continued to field requests through the fall and after he stepped down from Twitter, according to the complaint. And late last year, it said, the Justice Department contacted Agrawal and Segal's attorneys about multiple investigations into Twitter.  Letters to Twitter seeking reimbursement for the legal expenses were ignored for months, according to the complaint. In March, the company allegedly responded by acknowledging the requests for reimbursement, but took no action to pay. As of Monday, the executives still have not recovered the fees, the complaint said.",0

Three other employees have been suspended ""pending further investigation into a number of ongoing allegations.""  ""We apologize to the victims of this organizational failure, including those impacted by the revulsion we have all felt at hearing their stories,"" the CBI said. ""We wish to thank all those who have had the courage to speak out, through internal or external channels, and encourage them to keep doing so.""  Danker, who stepped aside in early March while the investigation took place, had previously apologized ""profusely,"" saying that any ""offense"" he caused was unintentional. On Tuesday, he reiterated his apology on Twitter and said he was ""shocked"" to hear of his dismissal ""instead of being invited to put my position forward as was originally confirmed.""   The CBI did not specify what wrongdoing it had found but stressed that Danker was ""not the subject of any of the more recent allegations"" of misconduct at the organization.  Danker will be replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the former chief economist of the CBI. The CBI, which was founded in 1965, represents about 190,000 UK businesses.

336,Dalai Lama apologizes after video asking child to 'suck' his tongue sparks outcry,"The Dalai Lama has apologized after a video emerged showing the spiritual leader kissing a child on the lips and then asking him to ""suck my tongue"" at an event in northern India. In a statement Monday, the office for the Dalai Lama said he ""wishes to apologize to the boy and his family, as well as his many friends across the world, for the hurt his words may have caused,"" adding he ""regrets"" the incident.  ""His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras,"" the statement said.  His apology comes after a video of the exchange, which took place during an event in the hillside city of Dharamshala in February, went viral on social media with many users criticizing the Dalai Lama's actions. In the video, the young boy can be seen approaching the Nobel Peace Prize winner before asking, ""Can I hug you?""  The 87-year-old spiritual leader then invites the boy on stage and points to his cheek and says, ""first here,"" prompting the boy to give him a hug and a kiss.  The Dalai Lama then points to his lips, and says: ""then I think finally here also."" He then pulls the boy's chin and kisses him on the mouth. ""And suck my tongue,"" he says after a few seconds, poking his tongue out.  The identity of the boy is not known. He was at an event with the M3M Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Indian real estate company M3M Group, based in Dharamshala, where the Dalai Lama lives in permanent exile. CNN has reached out to the M3M Foundation for comment.  In response to the incident, prominent Delhi-based child rights group, Haq: Center for Child Rights, told CNN in a statement it condemns ""all form of child abuse."" It added: ""Some news refers to Tibetan culture about showing tongue, but this video is certainly not about any cultural expression and even if it is, such cultural expressions are not acceptable."" Some of the Dalai Lama's supporters have decried the criticism, however, arguing the leader's actions have been misinterpreted under a Western lens.  ""Expression of emotions and manners today has been melted together and become vividly westernized,"" Namdol Lhagyari, a Tibetan activist in exile, wrote on Twitter. ""Bringing in narrative of other cultures, customs and social influence on gender and sexuality to interpret Tibetan way of expression is heinous.""  Sticking out one's tongue is a sign of respect or agreement and was often used as a greeting in traditional Tibetan culture, according to the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the world's best-known living Buddhist figure.  The principal spiritual leader of the ""Yellow Hat"" school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama is revered by millions as the reincarnation of his 13 predecessors.  The spiritual leader has been based in India since 1959, following an unsuccessful Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupation. He later established a government-in-exile in the northern Indian city of Dharamshala, leading thousands of Tibetans who followed him there. February's incident isn't the first time the octogenarian has sparked controversy in recent years.  He apologized after a 2019 interview with the BBC, during which he said if a female Dalai Lama should succeed him, she ""should be more attractive.""  The previous year, he suggested Europe should be kept for Europeans, when speaking about the rising level of African refugees entering the continent.  ""The whole Europe (will) eventually become Muslim country? Impossible. Or African country? Also impossible,"" he said, adding that it's better to ""keep Europe for Europeans.""",0
337,Shelter-in-place order lifted for neighborhoods near a burning fishing vessel in Washington,"A shelter-in-place order has been lifted for neighborhoods near a burning fishing vessel in the Hylebos Waterway in Tacoma, Washington, officials said.  The vessel -- which was still burning Monday and believed to be carrying 55,000 gallons of diesel and 19,000 pounds of freon -- caught fire early Saturday morning while moored in the waterway, the US Coast Guard said in a news release. The shelter-in-place order was issued after a ""significant explosion"" took place and fire conditions worsened, officials said.  By Monday, smoke conditions had improved. The US Environmental Protection Agency was still monitoring air quality, the Coast Guard said.  Crews were still trying to ""cool the haul, as the fire burns itself out"" with high-powered streams of water, the Tacoma Fire Department said Monday. ""While it appears that most of the flammable material onboard has burned, it is likely that smoke will continue to be visible throughout the day,"" the department said.  The explosion was linked to a heated compressed gas cylinder on the vessel, Port of Tacoma officials said Sunday night, citing fire officials. ""We were very fortunate that the fire was quickly spotted and reported and the crew onboard was able to safely evacuate,"" US Coast Guard Lt. Stephen Nolan told CNN affiliate KING-TV Sunday. By Sunday, the fire had spread throughout the vessel and was about 100 feet from the ship's freon tanks, according to the Coast Guard. Freon is a trademark name typically used to refer to several different refrigerants, including chlorofluorocarbons, according to the EPA. As the fire continues to burn, the heat from the flames can build pressure in the freon tanks, which have built-in heat-activated pressure relief valves designed to release pressure from the tanks in an emergency, according to the Coast Guard. ""While freon can be toxic if inhaled in large quantities or in a confined space, the release of freon into the atmosphere is not expected to pose any health and safety risks to the public,"" the Coast Guard said. Still, the Tacoma Fire Department asked residents of the Northeast Tacoma, Browns Point and Dash Point neighborhoods to ""remain indoors and limit exposures to smoke."" ""Residents concerned about smoky conditions can provide additional protections by keeping doors closed and shutting outside air vents. Residents may also want to avoid any strenuous activity or exercise outdoors,"" the mayor tweeted. The EPA has been monitoring the air in the surrounding areas, and first responders have deployed floating barriers around the vessel to contain any spills, according to the Coast Guard's news release.  The Coast Guard has also closed the Hylebos Waterway for all commercial and recreational vessel traffic.  As of Sunday night, no injuries had been reported and there were no signs of maritime pollution, the Coast Guard said. As crews continue to battle the fire with cooling spray, it remains unclear what ignited the blaze. Authorities said the cause of the fire remains under investigation.",0

Andy Beshear Monday evening about the shooting at a Louisville bank that left four people dead, the White House said. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. He said Congress needs to act on things like requiring safe storage of guns and background checks. A survivor of workplace gun violence himself, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he lost a very close friend, Thomas Elliot, in the Old National Bank shooting.  Greenberg said he was with Elliot's wife at the hospital earlier Monday morning. Elliot, a senior vice president at the bank, was also a close friend of Gov. Andy Beshear.   “It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,” he said speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well.” The mayor said he also visited Louisville Metro Police Officer Nickolas Wilt at the University of Louisville hospital saying he “made it through surgery and he's in serious condition at the hospital right now, but he is in great hands.”  Greenberg said he handed Wilt his graduation diploma from the police academy just a week and a half ago.  “I paid a visit to his academy class that was there at the hospital offering to support him, offering the support to he and his family today.” Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager with Old National Bank, told CNN she virtually witnessed the shooting Monday through her computer during a Microsoft Teams meeting.  “Shortly after the meeting started, the gunman, which is an employee, started shooting up the conference room,” Buchheit-Sims said. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that.”  “I’m just as much in shock and disbelief and was in disbelief as I watched it unravel,” she said of the incident, which she said “happened very quickly.”  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.  She described Sturgeon as someone with “just kind of a monotone personality.""  “His temperament is pretty low-key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed,"" she said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t know anything about Sturgeon having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as “extremely intelligent.”    At least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department. 
            Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
            Investigation: Police did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are ""hopeful"" that they can get the footage taken offline.
            Victims: The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according to updated information from the police department. Nine people were taken to the hospital, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Health. Three people have since been discharged, he said. Three others are in critical condition, including a recently graduated police officer who was shot in the head and had to have brain surgery, Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also injured.
            Reaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and State Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov. Andy Beshear said one of the victims, Tommy Elliot, was ""one of my closest friends"" and that the community will also mourn and miss all of the other victims. ##Catch Up## The city of Louisville will set up a family assistance center, in cooperation with the Red Cross, to help those affected by Monday’s bank shooting “deal with the trauma of this moment,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Monday afternoon.  “To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,” Greenberg said, adding that he is a survivor of a workplace shooting himself. “I’m a survivor of a workplace shooting. To the people who survived, whether you were physically hurt or not, I know that you’re hurting too. We are here for you as well,” Greenberg said.  In a statement Monday, Greenberg called the shooting at Old National Bank “another horrific tragedy” and asked for prayers for the “recovery of those who are receiving medical care, the families of those who lost a loved one, and those who are scared and heartbroken by what has happened this morning.” “Our deepest gratitude to the heroic efforts of first responders, who arrived within minutes of being called, and who risked their lives to save others. We will continue to provide updates throughout the day,” Greenberg said. CNN’s Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday repeatedly called on Congress to take actions to address gun violence, refusing to explicitly say whether President Joe Biden has exhausted all legal efforts to further combat the issue through executive action.  When asked during the White House press briefing if the president is at the end of his ability to do more on gun violence prevention, Jean-Pierre said, “So, there [are] actions that we have taken. The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”  The comments came hours after four people were killed in a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.  Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.  Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”  She said Biden has ""done a historic amount of work recently"" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.  She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all. We were just being mindful to the incoming information that was currently coming in from Louisville.”  Louisville shooter Connor Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be terminated from Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.  Sturgeon wrote a note for his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to shoot at the bank, the source said.  It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source.  The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has been taken down. Police are in possession of the video, according to the source. Connor Sturgeon, the 25-year-old identified by police as the gunman in Monday's mass shooting in Louisville, had worked for more than a year at the bank where he allegedly shot 13 people, killing at least four. At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age to 25 later in the day.)  Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” “This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,” said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. “I can’t even say how much this doesn’t make sense. I can’t believe it.” In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile. A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said. All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday.   “We are one commonwealth — united with the city, united with these families,” Beshear said at a news conference. Police said at least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital. Three of them remain in critical condition, the hospital said. The Louisville Police Department did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the man who is accused of killing at least four people at a bank Monday morning. Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department, said they are still working to learn more about the gunman. The shooter was killed by police shortly after he opened fire, police said. The gunman was shot and killed by police officers who were responding to the scene, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department. She said police got a call that there was a shooting at 8:35 a.m. ET and arrived at the bank three minutes later. Gwinn-Villaroel said officers ""responded in a timely, quick fashion, and we stopped the threat so that no additional loss of life could be taken."" Police previously said the gunman was dead, but did not confirm if he was shot by police or a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter was live streaming the attack on a Kentucky bank Monday morning, the interim chief of the Louisville police department said during a press conference. ""I will say this, that the suspect was live streaming. And unfortunately, that's tragic. To know that that incident was out there and captured,"" LMPD interim chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. Gwinn-Villaroel said that police are ""hopeful"" that they can get the footage taken offline. She didn't specify on what platform the suspect was live-streaming the shooting. Police released the names Monday of the four people who died following a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank. Here are the victims: Tommy Elliott, 63
            Jim Tutt, 64
            Josh Barrick, 40
            Juliana Farmer, 45  The post has been updated with the latest information from the police department on the victims' ages. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that one of those killed in the mass shooting Monday morning in Louisville was ""one of my closest friends."" Beshear said that Tommy Elliott, ""helped me build my law career. Help me become governor. Gave me advice on being a good dad.""  “He’s one of the people I talked to most in the world and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend,” the governor said. Elliott was the senior vice president of the bank, according to his LinkedIn. The governor said he received incorrect information earlier when he stated in a news conference that a second friend had been killed.  The governor also called the other deceased victims of the shooting ""amazing people"" whose communities will ""mourn"" and ""miss them."" CNN’s Celina Tebor contributed reporting to this post A Louisville Metro Police Department officer was shot in the head during a confrontation with the gunman Monday morning, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department. Nickolas Wilt, 26, was taken to the hospital and had brain surgery, she said during a news conference following the mass shooting that left four people dead. ""He is in critical but stable condition,"" she said. Wilt was new to the department, having graduated from the police academy at the end of March, she said. ""This will be a long complex investigation involving local, state and our federal partners,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also shot in the elbow, she said. Police identified the suspected shooter that killed at least four people at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, as Connor Sturgeon, a 25-year-old male.  He was employed at the bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel.  The shooter's ""weapon of choice"" was a rifle, Gwinn-Villaroel said.  The shooter died after officers exchanged gunfire with him, police added.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect age for the shooter based on information from police. He was 25. Kentucky officials are giving an update on the death of at least four people in a mass shooting at a bank in Louisville on Monday morning. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Gov. Andy Beshear are expected to give remarks. Police have said they believe there was only one shooter and that the gunman was a former employee of the bank. A local hospital received nine patients, two of them were police officers, according to officials. Three of them have been discharged, the hospital said. Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been briefed on the shooting that killed at least four people in Louisville, Kentucky, according to DHS spokesperson Marsha Espinosa. The secretary has been in contact with officials in the state, Espinosa said. Other federal officials have also been briefed on the shooting, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and President Joe Biden, the Justice Department and the White House said earlier. An officer hospitalized following the shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank is in critical condition, University of Louisville Hospital officials told CNN. Louisville police previously said at a news conference the officer was undergoing surgery. Two police officers were among nine people hospitalized following the shooting, hospital officials said. The University of Louisville Hospital received nine patients following a shooting at Old National Bank on Monday, hospital officials told CNN. Three of those nine patients have been discharged from the hospital, a spokesperson from the hospital said. Hospital officials will hold a press briefing with the Louisville mayor and Louisville Metro Police Department at 3 p.m. Monday. The manager at a brewery less than a block away from Old National Bank where at least four people were killed in a shooting Monday said the incident hits ""close to home."" Jason Smith, the operations manager at Against the Grain, a brewery in Louisville, said he was just arriving to work when he saw all first responders coming to the scene of the shooting at Old National Bank. The brewery is less than 500 feet away from the bank and both businesses are on the same street.  “Although we didn’t need to shelter in place, it kind of took a few minutes to figure out what was going on and assess the situation,” Smith told CNN affiliate WDRB.  Smith said the brewery has opened its doors to first responders, the mayor’s and governor’s teams, some chaplains, and said some of the employees from the bank have also come to the brewery. “I mean, these are our neighbors, you know, so we’re here to support and take care of them. We’re thinking about them,” Smith said.   President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting Monday at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, where four people were killed and nine others were injured. “Once again, our nation mourns after a senseless act of gun violence – Jill and I pray for the lives lost and impacted by today's shooting. Too many Americans are paying for the price of inaction with their lives. When will Republicans in Congress act to protect our communities?” Biden said in a tweet marking his first reaction to the shooting.  The current reality of a divided Congress makes additional legislative action highly unlikely.  In a second statement on the shooting, the president again called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. Biden said a ""strong majority of Americans"" want some kind of gun safety reform. He called for things like requiring safe storage of guns, background checks and changes to when gun manufacturers can be found liable. “Instead, from Florida to North Carolina to the U.S. House of Representatives, we’ve watched Republican officials double down on dangerous bills that make our schools, places of worship, and communities less safe. It’s unconscionable, it’s reckless, and too many Americans are paying with their lives,"" the president said. ##Reactions## Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on the fatal Louisville bank shooting, a Justice Department spokesperson said. Earlier today, the White House said President Joe Biden was informed of the shooting and the administration will have more to share later on.  Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville, Kentucky, called for action on gun violence in the wake of the shooting in his district today.  “Our community is one of far too many impacted by gun violence,” McGarvey said in a statement on Twitter. He said the shooting ""serves as a stark reminder that we need to address gun violence at the national level so no other family loses a son, a daughter, and a loved one.” He also thanked first responders for their quick action.  Read McGarvery's full statement: Kentucky state lawmakers are also calling for gun reform. State Sen. Karen Berg, who represents District 26 which includes parts of Louisville, said it's ""past time for action."" Berg said in a tweet that it is ""time to address common sense gun legislation,"" pointing out specific areas she wants to see change, including discussing red flag laws. State Rep. Lamin Swann, who represents a district near Lexington, tweeted, ""Common sense gun legislation NOW!"" Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed McGarvery's calls for ""stronger gun safety legislation"" in the other chamber of Congress. He said in a tweet the country grieves for those killed and their families, but noted that ""this cannot continue."" He said that lawmakers need to continue working for gun reform legislation. After a shooting at an elementary school in Nashville at the end of March, Schumer would not say whether he would put legislation to ban assault weapons on the Senate floor for a vote.  ##Reactions## The city of Louisville, Kentucky, has set up a family assistance center to help anyone looking to reunite with people involved in the bank shooting that killed at least four on Monday. The center is located at the Kentucky International Convention Center, Mayor Craig Greenberg said on Twitter. Read the tweet: The gun used in the Louisville bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source tells CNN.

341,"April 11, 2023 - Russia-Ukraine news","Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below. Two videos emerged on social media this past week that appear to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. The videos appear to be of separate events. One of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other — from the amount of foliage seen on the ground — looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker’s identification. “[The armoured vehicle] got f**ked by a mine,” the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.”  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. Shortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: “There will be an accountability for everything.”  An official Ukrainian government Telegram channel said the tweet was a direct reference to “another execution video published by Russians.”  Monday, the Institute for the Study of War said that Wagner was “reportedly continuing to commit war crimes by beheading Ukrainian servicemen in Bakhmut,” referencing a photo shared on pro-Russian social media sites showing what appeared to be a severed head mounted on a spike, which they claimed belonged to a Ukrainian soldier. The ISW has reported similar incidents in Popasna, in the Luhansk region, where Wagner troops were also operating earlier in the war. Some pro-Russian social media accounts have suggested Ukrainian forces were responsible for the beheadings in an effort to conceal identification. This echoes a similar claim made by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in January after his fighters apparently found bodies with severed hands and heads near Bakhmut. The CIA assesses that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “not serious about negotiations at this stage” of the war in Ukraine and it is “Ukrainian progress on the battlefield that is most likely to shape prospects for diplomacy” to end the ongoing conflict, CIA Director Bill Burns said on Tuesday. Speaking publicly for the first time, at Rice University, since leaked classified US military documents appeared online, Burns stressed the importance of Ukraine’s planned offensive, saying “a great deal is at stake in the coming months.” “Instead of backing down, he has doubled down,” Burns said about Putin, adding the Russian president believes he can grind down Ukraine and the West.  The CIA director specifically mentioned that Ukraine continues to defend the Donbas region, which one of the leaked intelligence documents says is likely heading for a stalemate.  ""Russia's grinding campaign of attrition in the Donbas region is likely heading toward a stalemate, thwarting Moscow's goal to capture the entire region in 2023,"" states one of the classified documents.  “Real countries fight back,” Burns said on Tuesday, adding that Ukraine and its president have done just that. “Putin was profoundly mistaken” in his assumptions about Ukraine before the war, Burns added. Burns emphasized the importance of continued US support for Ukraine, including through intelligence sharing, at a time when the leaked classified documents are raising questions about the administration’s view of the conflict. The CIA director made these statements at Rice University, where he's discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s aggressive posturing, Iran’s nuclear enrichment and other pressing foreign policy issues at school’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, according to the school's website. CIA Director Bill Burns said Tuesday he expects more nuclear saber rattling from Russia as its war in Ukraine continues, but his agency does not “see evidence of preparations for any potential use of nuclear weapons.” Burns said the CIA does not see any “significant change in nuclear deployments by Russian leadership."" He also said the leak of classified military documents represents an urgent problem for the US that is “as intense as anything” in the current moment.  Burns — stressing the importance of balancing both short-term and long-term issues —  specifically pointed to the leak as an immediate problem the US intelligence agencies are grappling with. The CIA director noted that the Justice Department is currently investigating the leak and declined to elaborate further on his understanding of the issue. Burns made these statements at Rice University Tuesday, where he's discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s aggressive posturing, Iran’s nuclear enrichment and other pressing foreign policy issues at school’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, according to the school's website. ##Pentagon Docs## The highly classified leaked Pentagon documents posted to social media offer a pessimistic US view of the war's progress in Ukraine.  The documents highlight flaws in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses and predict a stalemate in the war for months to come. The documents, which appear to date from February and March, detail many of Ukraine's perceived military shortfalls as Kyiv prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  Several of the classified documents warn Ukraine's medium-range air defenses to protect front-line troops will be ""completely reduced by May 23,"" suggesting Russia could soon have aerial superiority and Ukraine could lose the ability to amass ground forces in a counteroffensive.  The documents also underscore lingering problems with Russia's own military offensive, predicting that the result will be a stalemate between the two sides for the foreseeable future. Officials familiar with the situation tell CNN the documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing deck prepared for the Pentagon's senior leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.  The leaking of the documents — many of which are marked top secret — represents a major national security breach, and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security.  In addition to the assessment of the Ukraine war, the documents include intelligence gathered on allies and adversaries alike. Here are the latest headlines:  UN says nearly 8,500 civilian deaths confirmed in Ukraine since invasion: The  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine. between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration. 
            Ukraine's top national security official downplays leaked intelligence documents: Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to Oleksii Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council. ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod, of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov.
            Americans detained by Russia: Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with the parents of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal correspondent detained in Russia, Tuesday. It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist.
            Russia conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile: Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the defense ministry reports.  ##Catch Up## Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the defense ministry reports.  ""On April 11, 2023, a Strategic Missile Forces combat crew conducted a successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Kapustin Yar state central joint forces test range in the Astrakhan region,"" the statement said. The launch helped confirm the correctness of schematic and structural and technical solutions used in developing new strategic missile systems the defense ministry said. The missile's test warhead hit the target at the Sary Shagan firing range (Republic of Kazakhstan) with the target accuracy, according to the statement.  “The objectives of the launch were fulfilled in full,"" the statement read.  Back in February, Russia carried out a test of an ICBM that appears to have failed around the time President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that ""such testing is routine."" Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s failure to grant consular access to wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich “puts it, once again, in violation of international commitments it’s made."" “I think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access, never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes, is going to do even more damage to Russia's standing around the world — a standing that has been in free-fall, particularly since its rei-nvasion of Ukraine last year,” Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. “I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there, lest they be arbitrarily detained,” he said. Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist. Blinken did say what measures are being taken  to free Gershkovich, only saying that the US is “engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan’s release.” There was no physical damage to Canadian energy infrastructure after leaked US intelligence documents appeared to show that Russian hackers were attempting to cause damage to pipelines earlier this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Tuesday. “In regards to the reports of cyberattacks against Canadian energy infrastructure, I can confirm that there was no physical damage to any Canadian energy infrastructure following cyberattacks,” Trudeau said. Trudeau is hosting Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, in Toronto for an official visit where Canada announced more military and humanitarian aid for the country.  Trudeau also confirmed that his government website was down after a denial of service attack Tuesday morning. The website appeared to be functioning normally by 2:30 p.m. ET after being down for several hours.  “It’s not uncommon for Russian hackers to target countries as they are showing their steadfast support for Ukraine as they are welcoming Ukrainian delegations or leadership to visit, so the timing isn't surprising,” said Trudeau during a news conference alongside his Ukrainian counterpart, adding that “Russia being able to bring down an official government of Canada webpage for a few hours is in no way going to dissuade us from our unshakable support of Ukraine."" In February, Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which oversees Canada’s foreign intelligence and cybersecurity, issued an alert warning.  “Canadian organizations (need) to be vigilant and prepared for potential malicious cyber activity following the one-year mark of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Cyber Centre would like to specifically warn Canadian organizations and critical infrastructure  operators to be prepared for the possible disruption, defacement, and attempted exploitation of Canadian network assets by cyber threat actors aligned with Russian interests,” the statement reads. CSE said it would not confirm or deny any specific cyberattacks for security reasons. Canada pledged another $2.4 billion (CDN) loan to Ukraine to support essential services, such as pension payments, purchasing fuel and restoring damaged energy infrastructure. This funding will be distributed through an IMF facility and brings Canada’s total contribution in this regard to about $8 billion (CDN). Canada also signed a major nuclear supply contract to provide for Ukraine’s uranium needs to fuel its nuclear generators until 2035. ##Pentagon Docs## The United States has “engaged with allies and partners at high levels” in the days since the leak of classified documents came to light “to reassure them about our own committed to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Blinken noted that he had spoken Tuesday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and emphasized: “our enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty, its independence, reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries.” The top US diplomat said he would not comment specifically on the “purported documents” when asked about a report that documents showed Ukraine had engaged in attacks outside of its territory. However, Blinken noted that “Ukraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that's been seized from it.” “We give our advice as appropriate. We provide the support, that is well known, but Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory,” he said. The leak of classified Pentagon documents is being taken very seriously, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday. “I can't say much more while the Justice Department's investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously,” Austin said in his first public remarks about the leak. “And we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.”  Austin added that the Defense Department will “turn over every rock until we find the source” of the leaked intelligence documents.  “They were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don’t know, we simply don’t know at this point,” he said during a news conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior Philippine officials.  Austin said the documents they are aware of are dating February 28 and March 1, and that they do not know if there are “other documents” that had been posted.  “Again,” he said, “we will continue to investigate in and try to determine the full scope of the activity.” Austin said that he was first briefed on the “unauthorized disclosure” of documents on April 6 and has been convening senior leaders daily since then. More background: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi and Mostafa Salem contributed to this report.  ##Pentagon Docs## The White House says it has no indication Egypt is providing Russia with deadly arms for its war in Ukraine.  A leaked US intelligence document obtained by the Washington Post indicated Egypt’s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia. It said that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West."" ""We've seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council.  Kirby said Egypt remained “a significant security partner” and would remain so. “The United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years,” he said, speaking to reporters on board Air Force One.  The February-dated “top secret document” purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials referencing plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, and to keep the plans a secret, the Washington Post said. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is not able to confirm its authenticity. An Egyptian official, unnamed by state-affiliated media, called the Washington Post report “informational absurdity” and said that Egypt follows a “balanced policy” with all international parties, Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet said. The statement was carried by several Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Kirby refused to confirm the validity of the document and declined to detail any diplomatic conversations between Washington and Cairo.  ##Pentagon Docs## The family of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in Russia, released a statement on Tuesday calling for his release. “We are encouraged that the State Department has officially designated Evan as wrongfully detained. We appreciate President Biden’s call to us today, assuring us that the U.S. government is doing everything in its power to bring him home as quickly as possible,"" the statement said. The statement continued:  ""In addition to being a distinguished journalist, Evan is a beloved son and brother. There is a hole in our hearts and in our family that won’t be filled until we are reunited. We are grateful for the outpouring of support from his colleagues, friends and everyone standing with Evan and advocating for his immediate release.” The United Arab Emirates rejected reports suggesting that Russian intelligence was touting deepened ties with the Emirati government and planned to work against the United States and the United Kingdom, as reported by the Associated Press — citing an apparent intelligence document from the US.  The purported intelligence document which was posted online and viewed by the AP cited research reportedly from March 9 with the title “Russia/UAE: Intelligence Relationship Deepening,” that said US spies caught Russian intelligence officers boasting that they had convinced the UAE to “work together against US and UK intelligence agencies.”  CNN has not seen the document cited by AP, and both have been unable to confirm its authenticity.    “UAE officials have not seen any of the referenced materials, and any purported claims referenced in the Associated Press regarding the FSB enquiries are categorically false,” an official from the UAE told CNN in a statement on Tuesday. “We refute any allegation regarding an agreement to deepen cooperation between the UAE and other countries’ security services against another country,” the official said. “The UAE has deep and distinguished relations with all countries … and is committed to adherence to international law and respect for the sovereignty of states,” the official said.  The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing longstanding norms around the government's communications with the media.

It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. Biden told reporters, before boarding Air Force One, that he planned to speak with Gershkovich's parents. He connected with them aboard the plane as he flew to Northern Ireland, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.  ""The president made it clear that his national security team has been and will remain focused on securing Evan’s release as well as that of Paul Whelan,"" she said, referring to a second American who has been detained in Russia for several years. She said the charges of espionage against Gershkovich were baseless and said ""he should be released immediately."" The apparent leak of US classified information ""has demonstrated a serious level of inaccuracy,"" the UK's Ministry of Defence said Tuesday.  ""Readers should be cautious about taking at face value allegations that have the potential to spread disinformation,"" the ministry said in a brief statement posted on its official Twitter feed.  Ukraine's response: Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said on his Telegram channel Friday that he believes the documents that have been disseminated are inauthentic, have “nothing to do with Ukraine’s real plans” and are based on “a large amount of fictitious information” spread by Russia. But while Ukrainian officials brushed off the leak, Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of it, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. What's in the documents: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. They contain a wide range of highly classified information – providing a rare window into how the US spies on allies and adversaries alike. US allies are doing damage assessments, scrambling to determine whether any of their own sources and methods have been compromised by the leak. “We expect the US to share a damage assessment with us in the coming days, but we cannot wait for their assessment. Right now, we are doing our own,” said an official from a country that is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement with the US, which includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

CNN's Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post. ##Pentagon Docs## The US government investigations into a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents — which includes intelligence on the war in Ukraine — are starting to take shape, with the Pentagon examining how the leak impacts US national security and the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into who may have been behind the breach. The interagency probe is being led by the Pentagon’s Office of Intelligence and Security, according to three US officials, and could take months to complete. It will chiefly examine whether any sources and methods have been compromised since the documents, many of which are marked ""top secret,"" were posted on a social media platform earlier this year. Milancy Harris, the deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, will be in charge of the effort on the Pentagon side, officials said. The investigation will also try to determine the scope of the leak, since officials do not yet know whether it has been contained or whether there are more classified documents still circulating online. The Pentagon effort is not focused on the source of the leak, one senior Pentagon official said. But the Defense Department will be examining how it distributes highly classified information and whether it needs to change who receives it on a daily basis. “Way too many people have access to very sensitive information,” a senior US official told CNN, noting that “thousands” of people likely saw these documents before they hit the internet. The leaked materials appear to be photos of documents that were crumpled up and wrinkled, as though they had been folded and stuffed in a pocket. While many officials tend to take classified information home, one senior US official said, the fact that the paper was folded up “tells me this person did not have that authority.” Read more about the investigations here.  Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on Tuesday that Russian forces now control much of the embattled eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.  “We are fully concentrated on Bakhmut, continuing to carry out combat missions. In Bakhmut, most of it — that is, more than 80% — is under our control, including the entire administrative center, plants, factories, the city administration,” Prigozhin said. “What is left is part of the multi-story residential areas, where fortification districts were made. There are tunnels under these high-rise buildings.” Ukrainian officials have denied Prigozhin’s claim. ""This statement by Prigozhin is not true,” Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told CNN on Tuesday. “I've just been in touch with the commander of one of the brigades that are defending the city. I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut."" ""Prigozhin needs to show at least some victory in the city, which they have been trying to capture for nine months in a row, so he makes such statements,"" Cherevatyi added.  The Wagner founder has been known to make incorrect claims about his forces’ advance on the ground in Ukraine. Last week, he posted a grainy video raising a flag at dawn, saying Bakhmut had ""been taken,"" despite ongoing fighting in and around the city. His claim was seen as a ""pretty desperate"" attempt, Western officials said. What Western officials are saying: The officials conceded Russia had been able to make some progress in Bakhmut, but added it could be ""measured in meters."" ""The Russians at the moment, despite trying for six months, with huge numbers of personnel and huge numbers of losses, have been unable to take the town, and at the moment have made very, very slow progress,” the officials said at a briefing last Wednesday.  In the video this Tuesday, Prigozhin said Wagner fighters had relinquished control of some areas around Bakhmut to the Russian military.  “We handed over the flanks to the Ministry of Defence. Units of the Ministry of Defence, including the airborne troops, have today taken over both the right and left flanks,” he said. “That is why Zaliznyanskoye, Nikolaevka, and other settlements, which were stormed by units of the Wagner PMC in previous months, are in the area of responsibility of the airborne troops and other units of the Ministry of Defence.” CNN’s Max Foster contributed to this post.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reassured Ukraine of the United States’ support following a leak of classified Pentagon documents, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. During a call on Tuesday, Blinken “reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. support and vehemently rejected any attempts to cast doubt on Ukraine’s capacity to win on the battlefield,” Kuleba wrote Tuesday on Twitter, adding that the US ""remains Ukraine's trustworthy partner.""  The comments come after a number of highly classified Pentagon documents were released online in recent weeks. Some divulge key weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces gear up to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians – and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed reporting to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs## US President Joe Biden told reporters that he planned to speak to the family of jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich during his flight to Northern Ireland today.  The US State Department formally designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia, and Biden said that he tried to speak to Gershkovich’s family on Monday but would attempt again today. “We’re making it real clear that it’s totally illegal what’s happening. And we declared it, so changes the dynamic,” he said. A senior Egyptian official denied that Egypt’s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia, following a report from The Washington Post citing a leaked US intelligence document, Egyptian state-affiliated media said. A leaked US intelligence document obtained by The Washington Post said Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West.""

The statement was also carried by several other Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Egypt is one of the world’s top recipients of US military aid, receiving $1.3 billion in military financing annually. What Russia says: Russia’s Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the information a ""hoax."" ""It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now. This is how you should treat such publications,"" Peskov said in response to a question from a journalist on the report. CNN has reached out to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. Remember: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. ##Pentagon Docs## A spokesperson for US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN that Schumer has requested a classified briefing for all senators on the leaked classified US documents that appear to contain information about the war in Ukraine. Investigations and impact: The US Justice Department is investigating how the trove of highly sensitive documents ended up on social media sites.  The Defense Department is still reviewing the matter and has taken steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, officials said, which are normally available on any given day to hundreds of people across the government. While the Pentagon has stood up an “interagency effort” to assess the impact of the leak, US officials and close allies already fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships.

The Kremlin said Tuesday the amendments to military conscription legislation are not connected to mobilization, dismissing rumors of a new wave of enlistment in Russia. Asked during a regular call with reporters if the Kremlin is concerned that the proposed law, if passed, would trigger another wave of a mass exodus of Russians, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, ""Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with mobilization; it has to do with military registration.""  ""There is no second wave,"" Peskov said after being pressed further to respond to the rumors of an upcoming second wave of mobilization. The State Duma published the bill on Tuesday. According to the document, electronic summonses for military service will be equated to paper summons. Currently, conscription documents in Russia must be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer. A person will be considered notified even if they have not seen the call-up papers or email and from the moment of receipt of the summons. Those liable for military service will be banned from traveling abroad. Remember: Russia’s ""partial mobilization"" for its war in Ukraine, which was announced in September, resulted in a significant number of citizens fleeing Russia, as CNN previously reported. The Kremlin acknowledged mistakes were made in its military draft process, but maintains there is no discussion of a new wave of mobilization.   Nearly 8,500 civilians are confirmed to have been killed since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a statement Monday. The OHCHR said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022 until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration.  Most confirmed civilian deaths occurred in Ukrainian government-controlled territory that is under attack by Russia, according to the OHCHR, with 3,927 killed in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which have seen some of the bloodiest battles in the war so far. At least 1,894 civilians have been killed in territory occupied by the Russian Federation when the casualties occurred, the OHCHR said.  Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a man on suspicion of treason, state news agency TASS reported Tuesday. He is accused of transferring money to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The man was detained in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia’s southeast, after making “transfers of personal funds for the purchase of weapons, ammunition and uniforms by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the FSB said, according to TASS. He faces a prison sentence of 12 to 20 years and a possible additional fine of up to 500,000 rubles (around $6,000) if found guilty of treason, TASS reported. Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council.  ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Oleksii Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov. ""The data for conducting certain operations, the size of the units, who is involved and in what direction - this information is absolutely secret. If someone thinks he has it, I can only congratulate him. But I don't know where he could have them from,"" he said. “For the other part of the information - if it was indeed secret - the agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom will know exactly where it came from. And why it surfaced at this particular time,"" added Danilov. The start of Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive will be decided by the staff of the Commander-in-Chief at the very last moment, stressed Danilov.  ""If someone believes that we have only one option, it does not correspond to reality. Even three options would not be much,"" Danilov said in the interview. ""Intelligence agencies need to be more vigilant when it comes to classified documents,"" he added.  Some context: Ukraine has had to alter some of its military plans after the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskytold CNN. However, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, has said he believes the documents have “nothing to do with Ukraine’s real plans” and are based on “a large amount of fictitious information” disseminated by Russia. ##Pentagon Docs## Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. ""The Ministry of Defense did come to IK-17 to recruit prisoners to become war criminals like the rest of the Russian military. But Paul and some other prisoners were sequestered within IK-17, not transferred out,"" he said.  ""The prison administration claims that the phones have been out of order from March 30 through to April 9th or 10th. Russia's infrastructure appears so brittle it could be true, or the prison could just be playing silly buggers again,"" David Whelan said. David Whelan said it seemed his brother has become aware of the case of another wrongfully detained American — Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. ""Paul's fear of being left behind a third time was apparently palpable in his conversation with our parents yesterday,"" David Whelan said. ""We have asked our parents to express to Paul that Elizabeth and I can't conceive a scenario where the U.S. government conceded anything to the Kremlin for an American's release that did not include Paul. It would be an unconscionable betrayal."" The Biden administration has urged the Russians to immediately release both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. South Korea has claimed that a ""considerable amount"" of the material leaked from the Pentagon was fabricated, as US officials scramble to contain the effects of the leak. Elsewhere, Ukrainian refugees continue to cross the border into Poland, with 400,000 new arrivals in the past week taking the total number to 11 million since the start of the invasion. Here are the latest headlines: Ukrainian adviser pushes for more weapons: Ukraine needs more long-range weapons and “less contemplation on leaks,” said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, referring to the recent leak of classified Pentagon documents.
            South Korea claims leaked material was fabricated: South Korea's presidential office claims the defense ministers of South Korea and the United States have agreed that a “considerable amount” of information in the leaked Pentagon documents was fabricated, after the leak revealed a conversation among Korean officials on the war in Ukraine. 
            Ukraine PM in Canada: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has arrived in Canada ahead of a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau. In an interview with Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Shmyhal said he would request ammunition and heavily armored vehicles. 
            Refugees continue to flee to Poland: More than 11 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to Poland’s EU representation, with nearly 400,000 people crossing the border in the last week. 
            Kremlin says US journalist broke law: Detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich  ""was caught red-handed and violated the relevant laws of the Russian Federation,"" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday, in response to the US State Department designating him wrongfully detained.
            Long sentence for arson protest in Russia: A military court has sentenced two Russian men to 19 years in jail for setting a fire at a local administration building where a military registration desk was located, state media reported Monday. One of the men said the incident was a protest against the war in Ukraine. ##Catch Up## Detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich violated Russian law, the Kremlin maintained Tuesday, in response to the US State Department having designated him as being wrongfully detained. “The United States could and should protect the rights of its citizen, who was caught red-handed and violated the relevant laws of the Russian Federation. That is what he is suspected of. That is all I can say,” Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists during a regular conference call. Russian investigators formally charged Gershkovich with espionage, Russian state media reported, adding he denied the accusations. A Moscow court on April 18 will hear an appeal filed by Gershkovich’s lawyers against his arrest, Russian state media said citing the court. The correspondent is currently held in the notorious Leftereovo pre-detention center until May 29. What the US is saying: CNN reported on Monday that the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich’s release. CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post.  Ukraine needs more long-range weapons and “less contemplation on leaks,” said Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, referring to the recent leak of classified Pentagon documents. “If we had time, we could watch the RF [the Russian Federation] fall apart & its ‘elites’ devour each other. But we don't have it, as our people are dying,"" tweeted Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on Tuesday  “We need less contemplation on ‘leaks’ and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war and make the RF face the reality.”  Some context: Ukraine has pushed for long range weapons in order to be able to strike ammunition depots and logistics hubs that Russian forces have moved out of range of existing systems. In January, Ukrainian officials asked for longer range missiles that can reach inside Russia. But Western allies have so far been careful not to provide Ukraine with systems that can reach Russia in order to reduce the risk of escalating the conflict. CNN's Tim Lister and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs## A military court has sentenced two Russian men to 19 years in jail for setting a fire at a local administration building where a military registration desk was located, state media reported Monday. On October 11, 2022, Roman Nasryev and Alexey Nuriev threw a Molotov cocktail into the window of the government building in the town of Bakal, in Russia’s Chelyabinsk region, according to investigators cited by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The two men were found guilty of committing “a terrorist act by a group of persons by prior conspiracy” and of “training for carrying out terrorist activities.” Nuriev was reportedly the commander of the fire and rescue service of the Ministry of Emergencies, and Nasryev was a driver for the National Guard (Rosgvardia), local news website 74.ru said. The verdict marks the most severe sentence to date for anti-war arson, according to the human rights group Solidarity Zone, which believes the lengthy sentence could be because both men were working for government institutions. In March, Solidarity Zone reported that Nasryev told the court he “decided to take a similar action, because I did not agree with the mobilization, the ‘special military operation’ and the war in general.” “This way I wanted to convey my position of disagreement, I wanted my voice to be heard,” Nasryev added. Some context: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""partial mobilization"" in September 2022, meaning citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription. More recently, Russian officials have consistently denied rumors of a second mobilization. More than 11 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia invaded in February 2022, Poland’s EU representation tweeted on Tuesday.     Around 87% of those crossing the border are woman and children, it added. At the beginning of April, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that just over 10.6 million people had crossed the border.  This means that nearly 400,000 people have travelled from Ukraine to Poland in the last week.  There are currently more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees living in Poland and more than 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees settled in other European countries, the UNHCR reports. ""All those fleeing the war will find shelter and all the help they need in Poland,” Poland’s EU representation added.   Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has arrived in Canada ahead of a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, according to his official Twitter account. Shmyhal said Canada was among the first countries to “stand with Ukraine,” and the two governments are “preparing new agreements and deals to strengthen the macro-financial and economic stability of Ukraine."" In an interview with Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Shmyhal said he would request ammunition and heavily armored vehicles.  “It’s crucially important for the organization of our counteroffensive,"" he told the Globe. South Korea's presidential office claims the defense ministers of South Korea and the United States have agreed that a “considerable amount” of information in the leaked Pentagon documents was fabricated, after the leak revealed a conversation among Korean officials on the war in Ukraine. ""On the US government’s alleged wiretapping, the defense ministers of the two countries agreed that ‘a considerable amount of the documents were fabricated,’” the presidential office said in a statement without providing further details.  The statement did not specify whether they believe that only the parts about South Korea is fabricated, or the documents in general.  CNN has asked the presidential office why they believe some of the information has been fabricated. CNN cannot independently confirm if any of the documents have been altered or fabricated. The leaked conversation: The leaked documents described a conversation between two senior South Korean national security officials over a US request for ammunition.   The officials worried that supplying the ammunition, which the US would then send to Ukraine, would violate South Korea’s policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war. According to the document, one of the officials then suggested a way of getting around the policy without actually changing it – by selling the ammunition to Poland. In previous CNN reporting, a US official said the leaked documents ""look real."" Seoul's response: South Korea said its Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup had held a phone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning, at Austin's request. On the call, Austin explained recent media coverage of the leak and said the US would ""closely communicate and fully cooperate"" with Seoul on this issue, according to South Korea’s Defense Ministry. CNN has not a received a readout of the call from the office of the US Secretary of Defense. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense for comment, and for a readout of the call, but has not yet received a response. Here's what we know about the leak. ##Pentagon Docs## In his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky celebrated the release of some Ukrainian prisoners of war, vowing to ""return everyone."" Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners in their latest swap, with 80 men and 20 women returning to Ukraine.  ""These are a hundred families who got real joy on the eve of Easter. And, of course, we keep working to return all our people from Russian captivity,"" Zelensky said. ""We remember everyone! And we will return everyone!"" Diplomatic efforts: He also outlined ongoing foreign policy and diplomacy efforts; on Monday, he met prominent British entrepreneur Richard Branson, spoke with the Greek prime minister and struck an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister. Zelensky added that Germany continues to provide defense assistance, including armored vehicles, ammunition, medicine and more. Boosting Ukraine's defense capabilities ""protects everyone in the partner countries, everyone in Europe, everyone in the world,"" he added. ""The term 'defeat' should become a companion to the term 'aggressor', and it is only the Ukrainian victory that will ensure this,"" Zelensky said.  Russia is using ""scorched Earth"" tactics as it tries to take the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine's top land commander. Across the country's east, Ukraine is continuing to repel Russian attacks, the military says.  A prisoner swap saw 200 servicemen exchanged; meanwhile, the fallout from the Pentagon leak of classified documents continues, with the Kremlin denying any involvement. Here are the latest headlines: Russia devastating Bakhmut: Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy Bakhmut, in what one commander has called ""scorched Earth"" tactics. Meanwhile, Ukraine is working to repel Russian forces in the country's east, with more than 20 attacks repelled within 24 hours, according to Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces.
            Detained reporter: The US State Department officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was ""wrongfully detained."" Gershkovich is being held in Russia, and this designation will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.
            Prisoner swap: Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners of war in their latest swap. Moscow's Defense Ministry said it received 106 Russian servicemen, while Ukraine's presidential office head said 100 Ukrainians were returned home — including troops who had fought to defend Mariupol, Hostomel and Azovstal.
            Ukraine on the Pentagon leak: A Ukrainian Defense Ministry representative on intelligence accused Russia of using altered versions of the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online to spread disinformation. ""In recent decades, Russia's most successful intelligence operations have been carried out in Photoshop,"" said Andrii Yusov.
            Moscow's response: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed accusations that Moscow may have been involved in the leak. “The tendency to always blame Russia for everything and blame everything on Russia is now a common disease,” he said. ##Catch Up## The recent leak of classified US military documents, if authentic, could have deadly consequences for the Ukrainians in the war with Russia, said the top Democrat on the US House intelligence committee.  “It won’t be hard for the Russians to cut off [intelligence] collection avenues that might have been saving lives every day,” Rep. Jim Himes said on Monday.   “Anything that points to sources and methods carries the very real risk that those sources and methods go away,” Himes said. “And that can mean people being killed, that can mean technologies being shut down. And that translates into bad outcomes on the battlefield.”  Himes emphasized that he had not been briefed on the documents and could not independently corroborate their authenticity. But US officials have told CNN that the documents appear real. The fallout: US allies are doing damage assessments, scrambling to determine whether any of their own sources and methods have been compromised by the leak.  Himes said he worried that the closest of US allies — the so-called ""Five Eyes"" intelligence partnership that includes Australia Canada, New Zealand and the UK — “might think twice about sharing their most sensitive intelligence” because of the leak. The leak has also led the Pentagon to take steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, US officials have said. ##Pentagon Docs## Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who is being held in Russia, has been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department.   “Today, Secretary Blinken made a determination that Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained by Russia,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement Monday. The designation underscores the United States government’s statements that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless, and it will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.  Gershkovich’s case will now be handled at the State Department through the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.   Both of the Americans who have been recently brought home from Russia — Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner — had been designated as wrongfully detained, and were freed in prisoner swaps.  Paul Whelan, who remains imprisoned in Russia, also has been declared wrongfully detained.  In his statement, Patel said the “U.S. government will provide all appropriate support to Mr. Gershkovich and his family.” “We call for the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr. Gershkovich,” he said. “We also call on Russia to release wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.” US State Department Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has been tapped to lead the diplomatic response to the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, according to a US official familiar with the matter. US government officials “are engaging with allies and partners at high levels over this including to reassure them of our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and the fidelity of securing our partnerships” following the mass leak of highly classified documents, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Monday. Patel would not go into details about which countries they had engaged, saying “that work is ongoing.” Asked by CNN if the State Department is taking the lead on those conversation, Patel said that “as the main diplomatic branch and agency of this administration, of course the Department of State would have a role in communicating with our allies and partners, but these conversations are happening across the administration.” “US officials are engaging with allies and partners at the highest level over this,” he said.  Patel would not say if any steps had been taken to restrict access to classified information at the State Department as a result of the leak, saying he did not want to discuss policy decisions.  CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  International response: Patel would not speak on specific comments from South Korean and Israeli officials reacting to leaked documents. South Korea’s presidential office said it will hold “necessary discussions with the US” regarding the document leak, which comes as the relationship between Seoul and Washington is already strained due to South Korean anger over the Inflation Reduction Act harming South Korea’s electronic vehicle industry and concerns related to the US CHIPS Act.  “There is a lot of frustration towards the Yoon administration for being too committed to the US alliance so every aspect of the US-South Korea relationship is under the microscope,” said a former US Ambassador to South Korea.   The South Korean president is scheduled to visit the White House later this month, making the timing around this incident particularly unfortunate the former diplomat said.   “Does Yoon have to raise this during the State Visit? We don’t know yet,” the diplomat said More broadly, one diplomat from a NATO country told CNN that they do not believe Moscow was overly surprised by the most of the intel that was revealed in the leaked documents, noting Russia has robust intelligence gathering operations.  They also said that they were not frustrated that there was US intelligence that was not widely shared with allies. This diplomat said most nations do not share everything with their allies nor is there an expectation that they do so.  “That’s not the way it works,” the diplomat said. ##Pentagon Docs## The Pentagon is still working to determine the scale of a leak of classified information that has occurred in recent weeks, Chris Meagher, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said Monday.  CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  “The Department of Defense is working around the clock to look at the scope and scale of the distribution, the assessed impact, and our mitigation measures,” Meagher said. “We're still investigating how this happened, as well as the scope of the issue. There have been steps to take a closer look at how this type of information is distributed and to whom. We’re also still trying to assess what might be out there.”  Meagher said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was first briefed on the leak on April 6 and began “convening senior leaders on a daily basis” the next day.  Over the weekend, US officials engaged with allies and partners — some of whom were also implicated in the document leak, Meagher said.  The Pentagon team is also working to determine if the leak of classified material includes the Defense Department’s legislative affairs, public affairs, policy, general counsel, intelligence and security, and joint staff offices, Meagher said.  Meagher said the team is a “coordinated effort amongst several different components of DOD” who were all working to “get our arms around everything that has to do with” the leak. Meagher declined to say who specifically was in charge of that team and overseeing those efforts. ##Pentagon Docs##",0

343,Lawmakers seek details on 'unusually cozy' ties between tech executives and SVB,"Democratic lawmakers sent letters to 14 of the largest depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, seeking details about the lender's ""unusually cozy"" relationships with its well-heeled clients.  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sent the letters Sunday to executives at Roku, Roblox, Circle and BlockFi, among others, raising questions about their ""white glove"" treatment by SVB. Silicon Valley Bank was known to cater to the tech startup world. But Warren and Ocasio-Cortez, citing media reports, raised concerns about whether the bank's relationships went beyond industry standards and potentially hastened its collapse last month.  SVB reportedly provided lower-interest-rate mortgages for tech start-up founders whom other banks wouldn't lend to, according to the New York Times, while sponsoring industry ski trips, conferences, and fancy dinners, the lawmakers wrote. ""Silicon Valley Bank's unusually cozy relationship with its clients increased the threat of contagion when the bank went under,"" said Senator Warren in a statement. ""The American people deserve to know how these mutual backscratching arrangements developed, who benefited from them, and what role they played in Silicon Valley Bank's failure."" SVB became the second-largest bank failure in US history a month ago. State and federal regulators stepped in to shut the bank down a day after panicked depositors yanked their funds, drawing down $42 billion in the span of a single day.  The vast majority of the bank's deposits were uninsured, which makes the bank more vulnerable to a run. Depositors with less than $250,000 limit set by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are far less likely to draw down their money at the first sign of trouble.",0
344,"Consumers feel credit is getting harder to come by, Fed survey shows","US consumers are starting to feel that credit is getting harder to come by, according to survey results released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Consumer perceptions of credit access and availability declined in March, with the share of respondents reporting it's harder to obtain credit than one year ago climbing to the highest since the New York Fed started conducting its Survey of Consumer Expectations in 2013. In March, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank roiled the banking sector, escalating fears of a credit crisis. While action taken by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department appears to have allayed concerns of further collapses, economists anticipate that a further tightening of credit standards may follow, further pressuring businesses and consumers in this environment of high interest rates and moderating inflation. For the first time since October, US consumers' year-ahead inflation expectations increased. Near-term inflation expectations increased 0.52 percentage points to 4.7%, according to the New York Fed's March 2023 Survey of Consumer Expectations. It's the largest jump in one-year inflation expectations since March of last year. Consumers' uncertainty about future inflation outcomes also increased for the one-year horizon. However, longer-term inflation expectations decreased when looking three and five years out, according to the report. The Fed closely watches measurements of inflation expectations. If those expectations are higher, the concern is that it could lead to more workers bargaining for higher wages to counteract losses in purchasing power and businesses passing along higher expenses in the form of price increases. Looking beyond inflation, consumers' expectations of higher unemployment increased by 1.3 percentage point to 40.7%, driven by consumers between the ages of 40 and 60 years old and those with household incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 a year. Still, the mean perceived probability of losing a job declined, and fewer people anticipated they would leave their job.",0
345,How long should you support your adult children? Parents — and their kids — weigh in,"Parents invest so much of themselves, emotionally and financially, in raising their children — but the time comes when a parent has to stop subsidizing their adult children's everyday expenses. Think housing, health insurance, car payments, cell phones, credit cards, subscription services, student loans and travel.  And, as it turns out, kids and parents don't agree on just when exactly that time should be.  A new survey from Bankrate found that Gen Z adults (between the ages of 18 and 26) think parents should slow their roll on when to stop paying for them. Take housing. Gen Z adults said they shouldn't have to start paying rent until age 23 on average. Baby Boomer and Gen X parents beg to differ, saying their kids should pony up starting at age 21. When it comes to cell phones and credit card bills, Gen Z thinks they should start paying for them by age 21. Their parents say age 19 would be better.  The Bankrate survey doesn't specify how many respondents are living with their parents or, conversely, their adult children. But it's a fair bet the percentage could be significant. In July 2022, the Pew Research Center found that half of adults ages 18 to 29 were living with at least one parent. The risk for parents of subsidizing adult children Of course, how a parent feels about the need for their child to pay their own bills and what a parent does may be two very different things. Nearly 7 in 10 parents with children 18 or older said they have made a financial sacrifice to help their grown-up kids, according to the survey. Thirty-one percent characterized that sacrifice as ""significant,"" while 37% said it was ""somewhat significant."" Sacrifice meant: Reducing their emergency savings (51%), impairing their ability to pay off their own debt (49%) or save for retirement (43%); and making it hard to reach some other financial milestone (55%). Low-income parents — defined as those making $50,000 or less a year — were most likely to say they have made financial sacrifices to help their adult children.  For instance, 58% of the lowest earners said they sacrificed their emergency savings compared to 46% of the highest earning households — defined as earning $100,000 or more a year. While it can be hard to say no to your adult offspring if they ask for, or simply expect, a financial assist, parents do themselves no favors if they subsidize them at the expense of their own financial security.  After all, not everyone is likely to backstop a parent who falls behind on housing payments, fails to create a sufficient financial cushion for retirement or who finds they can't afford medical care. ""Make sure the assistance [you give] works within your budget and be clear about the parameters,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior analyst at Bankrate. ""Helping out shouldn't be seen as a blank check or an indefinite handout. It might help to attach a specific dollar amount or time frame."" Bankrate's survey, conducted from March 14 to March 16, included responses from a nationally representative sampling of 2,346 US adults, of whom 773 were parents with children age 18 or older.",0

349,Webb telescope captures 'green monster' inside a young supernova,"The James Webb Space Telescope has spied colorful, never-before-seen details in one of the most well-observed remnants of an exploded star. The glowing gas and dust of Cassiopeia A is all that remains of a star that exploded in a supernova, and its light reached Earth for the first time 340 years ago. It's the youngest known supernova remnant in our galaxy, which is why the celestial object has been studied by a multitude of ground and space-based telescopes.  Cassiopeia A is located 11,000 light-years away in the Cassiopeia constellation, and the remnant stretches for 10 light-years. Insights from Cas A, as the remnant is also known, allow scientists to learn more about how stellar explosions occur.  Astronomers turned the Webb telescope and its instruments in the direction of Cas A to see if the observatory's infrared capabilities could pick up anything other telescopes have missed. Infrared light is invisible to the human eye, allowing Webb to spy otherwise invisible aspects of the universe. ""Cas A represents our best opportunity to look at the debris field of an exploded star and run a kind of stellar autopsy to understand what type of star was there beforehand and how that star exploded,"" said Danny Milisavljevic, assistant professor at Purdue University and principal investigator of the Webb program that captured the new observations, in a statement. ""Compared to previous infrared images, we see incredible detail that we haven't been able to access before,"" said co-investigator Tea Temim, research astronomer at Princeton University, in a statement. Webb's new infrared image of Cas A has been translated into visible light so the human eye can see the remnant's colors. Red and orange light on the remnant's exterior indicates warm dust, where material ejected from the star before it exploded is colliding with surrounding gas and dust. Inside the bubble-like structure of the remnant, bright pink light can be seen, along with features that resemble clumps and knots. This material came from the exploded star and includes glowing heavy elements like argon, neon and oxygen. A bright green loop along the right side of the bubble has also captured the interest of researchers. ""We've nicknamed it the Green Monster in honor of Fenway Park in Boston. If you look closely, you'll notice that it's pockmarked with what look like mini-bubbles,"" said Milisavljevic. ""The shape and complexity are unexpected and challenging to understand."" The team is still trying to understand the sources behind all of the different colors in the image. Studying remnants like Cas A can help scientists understand cosmic dust, a building block for stars and planets, and how exploded stars release elements crucial for life. ""By understanding the process of exploding stars, we're reading our own origin story,"" Milisavljevic said. ""I'm going to spend the rest of my career trying to understand what's in this data set.""",0
350,South Korea claims 'considerable amount' of information in leaked Pentagon documents is fabricated,"South Korea said on Tuesday that information contained in the leaked classified Pentagon documents that appeared to be based on sensitive conversations between top South Korean security officials is ""fabricated,"" without providing further details.  The documents have become a domestic issue in South Korea amid accusations they expose the extent of United States eavesdropping on key regional allies.  The fallout comes as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is scheduled to make an official state visit to the US on April 26 where he will be hosted by US President Joe Biden. The two countries will celebrate the 70th anniversary of their joint security alliance during the visit. One document released in the leak suggests South Korean officials were concerned ammunition sold to the US could be diverted to Ukraine, potentially violating the country's policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries engaged in conflict.  Another document cites information relating to South Korea as coming from a ""signals intelligence report,"" or intelligence gathered through the interception of communication signals. In a statement, the office of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said allegations the US had penetrated the country's official communication channels were ""an absurd false suspicion.""  The statement said South Korean defense chief Lee Jong-sup held phone talks with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin Tuesday morning, during which they agreed that ""a considerable amount of the documents were fabricated.""  The statement did not specify whether the two sides believe that only the parts about South Korea are fabricated, or the documents in general.  South Korea's Defense Ministry said the call took place at the request of Austin. During the call, the US Secretary of Defense explained recent media coverage of the leak and said the US would closely communicate with South Korea on this issue, according to the statement. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense for comment, and for a readout of the call. A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that the call happened but would not offer any additional details, saying only that a US readout would be released soon.   CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents.  Asked about the validity of the documents, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told reporters at a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, ""we know that some of them have been doctored,"" but that he didn't want to ""speak to the validity of all the documents."" ""We're still working through the validity of all the documents that we know are out there,"" Kirby said. Pressed on if the US believes that some of the documents are valid, Kirby said the administration ""cannot speak to the veracity and the validity of any of those documents at this point."" Kirby added later there was, ""no excuse for these kinds of documents to be in the public domain. They don't deserve to be in the public domain. They deserve to be protected. So, we're going to get to the bottom of this,"" but he said, ""we need to be careful speculating right now."" 'Absurd false suspicion' The revelations have led South Korean opposition lawmakers to suggest the US had wiretapped the South Korean presidential office, which had moved from the Blue House to the Yongsan Presidential Office in Seoul last May.  The claims of wiretapping were denied by the South Korean presidential office. ""We clearly state that the suspicion of wiretapping the Yongsan Presidential Office is an absurd false suspicion,"" the statement said.  ""Unlike the Blue House where the president's office, secretary's office and security office were scattered, currently we are maintaining 'iron security' through an integrated security system and dedicated personnel,"" the statement added. South Korea is a major arms exporter and President Yoon announced last year plans to become one of the world's top four weapons suppliers. In July, the country signed a deal to supply Poland with almost 1,000 K2 tanks, more than 600 pieces of artillery and dozens of fighter jets. And in November, a US defense official told CNN that Washington intends to buy 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition from South Korean arms manufacturers to provide to Ukraine. On Monday, the presidential office said South Korea's policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war remains unchanged.",0

352,"April 10, 2023 - One of ousted Tennessee lawmakers heading back to House","""Today was a powerful day and a testament to people power,"" reinstated Rep. Justin Jones said Monday. Jones, along with former Rep. Justin Pearson, was expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on Thursday after the two of them and fellow Democrat, Rep. Gloria Johnson, staged a demonstration on the floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. On Monday, he returned to the legislature after a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council. Tennessee law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held. Jones said being expelled and reinstated made him understand that ""we need more representatives who are willing to risk a title to be with the people, to stand with the people. We need bold leadership.""  Now that he's back in office, Jones was told he can file 15 bills – as he's now technically a new member – which he said he plans to do by the end of the week. “Every one of those bills are going to have to do with common sense guns laws,"" he said. ""Every single one of those bills going to have to do with that, because that's what these young people are begging us to do."" Jones added, noting he's 27 years old: ""It’s time for a new generation of voices to step into their power here,"" describing it as a movement to transform the community and the nation with “a new vision of a multicultural democracy."" The Congressional Black Caucus released a statement Monday after Rep. Justin Jones was reinstated to his seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives.  ""We applaud the Nashville City Council for unanimously reappointing Rep. Jones to give voice back to the constituents that sent him to the Legislature. While this is what the residents of Nashville deserve, we must recognize that Rep. Jones was reappointed to his position not because the Republican majority did the right thing, but because Rep. Jones’ constituents in Nashville, joined by supporters from all over our country, peacefully voiced their concerns about the prevalence of gun violence in our communities and the ongoing assault by Republicans on our democracy,"" the statement read. The caucus called for both Reps. Jones and Justin Pearson to be reinstated after the two of them were expelled Thursday after they and Rep. Gloria Johnson — who was not expelled — staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn.  “Rep. Justin Jones’ reappointment is a victory only because the residents of Nashville would not be disenfranchised and cast aside because Republicans would rather put politics over public safety,"" the statement read. Former Rep. Justin Pearson told CNN's John Berman he celebrated the fact that his colleague, Rep. Justin Jones, was reinstated Monday while also understanding another mass shooting had just taken place in Kentucky, not even a month after six people were gunned down in Nashville.  “It is multiple emotions — celebration and of the determination of the people who want to see justice happen with Rep. Jones being reseated and there’s also a painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like (Speaker of the House) Cameron Sexton and the Republican party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,” Pearson said Monday. Pearson and Jones were expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on Thursday after the two of them and Rep. Gloria Johnson staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. The chairman of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners has called a special meeting for Wednesday to consider reappointing Pearson to his former seat.  If reinstated, Pearson didn't directly answer if he'd break the rules of decorum again. Instead, he responded: ""Sometimes rules have to be broken for people who have been pushed to the periphery to be brought to the center of the conversation.""  “I believe that our actions were wholly justified in that even though we broke a rule of decorum, we stood up and we spoke for people who needed us to speak for them. … I believe what we did was right and it was for right,” Pearson added. Former Rep. Justin Pearson stood on the steps of the Capitol with Justin Jones Monday, following the city council’s unanimous decision to reinstate Jones as an elected official, and told supporters “the movement lives.” “It's never a good idea to give up on the movement led by people that look like this who are committed to the ideals, but not just committed in heart but in body and spirit, and they'll show up for the movement,” Pearson said. “The movement lives.”  Pearson said that House members were wrong when they thought they could expel Justin Jones and the voice of the people. “They thought that if they could expel the voice of the people, that the people would not rise. They thought that if they could kick out Rep. Justin Jones, that he would never again be representative Justin Jones. But they were wrong,” he said.   Pearson told supporters that having a voice and a vision in the state House matters. “You might try and silence it. You might try and expel it, but the people's power will not be stopped. The people’s power will not be stopped,” he said. “Because this is what democracy looks like.” Rep. Justin Jones welcomed ""the people back to the people's house"" while speaking on the House floor for the first time since being reappointed to his seat as an interim representative. Jones and another Democratic lawmaker Rep. Justin Pearson were expelled from the state House last week over a demonstration for gun control. Jones and Pearson are both Black. A third lawmaker, Rep. Gloria Johnson,  a White woman and Democrat who also participated in the demonstration, survived the vote and held on to her seat in the GOP-dominated chamber. “Today we stand as witness to the resurrection of a movement of a multi-racial democracy, that no unjust decision will stand,"" Jones said Monday. “The people of District 52, all 78,000 people have a voice in this chamber once again."" State Rep. Justin Jones was sworn back into his House District 52 seat as an interim representative Monday. He took the oath on the steps of the state capitol in Nashville surrounded by a crowd of people. The GOP-dominated House voted to expel the state representative last week after he and two other Democrats called for gun reform on the chamber floor.  The vote by Nashville Metropolitan Council on Monday to appoint Jones passed unanimously. Walking arm-in-arm with a crowd of what he described as thousands of people, Rep. Justin Jones walked back to the Tennessee state capital after the Nashville Metropolitan Council voted unanimously to reappoint him to the state House. The council decided to send the ousted lawmaker back to occupy the House District 52 seat as an interim representative on Monday after he was expelled from his seat last week. “Today we’re sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence,"" Jones said to the crowd on the steps of the capital building a few minutes after the vote. He said he hopes this sends a message to Republican leadership and state House Speaker Cameron Sexton that “the people will not let his crimes against democracy happen without challenge."" He called for Sexton to resign as the speaker. Jones and Rep. Justin Pearson, who represents a district in another part of the state, were expelled over their gun control demonstration on the chamber floor following the deadly Nashville school shooting.  Jones said the first thing he plans to do when he gets back in the House is to continue to fight for gun reform. He said people spoke through their elected local council members and that this is bigger than one person or position, that it's a movement “to restore the soul and heart of what this building should represent and that is democracy,” he said pointing to the state capital building. The Nashville Metropolitan Council on Monday voted to reappoint Justin Jones to Tennessee House of Representatives, sending the ousted lawmaker back to occupy the House District 52 seat as an interim representative.   The decision to return Jones to his seat came after the council voted to suspend a procedural rule that prevents an individual from being nominated and appointed to the seat in the same meeting.  The GOP-dominated House voted to expel the state representative last week after he and two other Democrats called for gun reform on the chamber floor The vote to appoint Jones passed 36-0 with no one abstaining.   Minutes before the Nashville Metropolitan City Council were to decide on whether or not to suspend rules and vote former Rep. Justin Jones as an interim member of the House of Representatives, Councilman Brett Withers urged his colleagues to place Jones back in his seat after the lawmaker was expelled Thursday along with former Rep. Justin Pearson. “I implore my colleagues not to play political games, to listen to the will of all of the voters and to place Justin Jones back in his rightful place in the General Assembly this evening,” Withers told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Withers told Tapper he believes there will be enough votes to place Jones back in his seat and that the council is hearing from supporters throughout the state. “So I believe that not only do we have the votes to confirm Justin this afternoon at 4:30, I would strongly encourage any of my colleagues to avoid objecting to the suspension of the rules,"" Withers said. Withers said there are many in the community who want Jones back in his seat. “There are just so many people who are hurting right now and are angry – justifiably angry – and this is not an appropriate time to play political games like that. We need to get Justin Jones back to his rightful place representing House District 52 in the General Assembly,” he said. Withers told Tapper he believes that racism played a role in the expulsion and has been an issue in the General Assembly. “I think that we have seen so much racism, frankly, from our General Assembly – that definitely plays a role,” Withers said. “But nevertheless, the results speak for themselves and really speak to the level of racism that we've seen from our general assembly for quite a long while now and seemingly getting worse and worse every year.” Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton will not prevent ousted representatives Justin Jones or Justin Pearson from being seated if their local governing bodies appoint them to serve as interim representatives in their former districts, a spokesperson for the Republican Speaker's office tells CNN.  “The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats. Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires,” Doug Kufner, Sexton's communications director, said in a statement provided to CNN on Monday.  The Metropolitan Council in Nashville is expected to vote this afternoon during a called special meeting at 4: 30 p.m. local time (5:30 p.m.ET).  The chairman of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners has also called a special meeting to consider reappointing Justin Pearson to his former seat as the District 86 State Representative.  The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, at 1:30 p.m. local time (2:30 p.m. ET).    The Nashville mayor's office has quietly been encouraging council members to vote to reinstate Justin Jones into his former seat as an interim successor, according to a metro official with knowledge of events happening. At a special meeting called for Monday afternoon, the Metropolitan Council will officially announce the vacancy of the District 52 seat, then vote to nominate Justin Jones to fill the seat.  Then, council members will vote to suspend the rule prohibiting an individual from being nominated and appointed within the same meeting allowing the council to vote to formally appoint Jones to the Tennessee House as soon as Monday afternoon.  The special meeting is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. local time (5:30 p.m. ET).    The expulsion of Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson from the Tennessee House was a rare move. The House has only expelled two state representatives in the last 157 years.  The first expulsion, in 1980, was of a representative found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office, and the most recent came in 2016 when another member was expelled over allegations of sexual harassment. Democratic Rep. Joe Towns called the move a “nuclear option.” “You never use a sledgehammer to kill a gnat,” Towns said. “We should not go to the extreme of expelling our members for fighting for what many of the citizens want to happen, whether you agree with it or not.” The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Kathy Sinback, called the move in a statement a “targeted expulsion of two Black legislators without due process.” “It raises questions about the disparate treatment of Black representatives, while continuing the shameful legacy of disenfranchising and silencing the voices of marginalized communities and the Black lawmakers they elect,” Sinback added. Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were kicked out of the legislature by their colleagues in a vote Thursday. A third member also up for expulsion, Rep. Gloria Johnson, survived the vote, which required two-thirds majority support in the Republican-dominated chamber. Jones' and Pearson's pictures and profiles had already been removed from the state’s General Assembly website, a symbol of the vacant seats that now need to be filled. All three had been accused by Republicans of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives” after they led a gun control protest on the House floor last month without being recognized, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. In the wake of a deadly shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, which killed three 9-year-olds and three adults, Jones said he and other lawmakers were blocked from raising the issue of gun violence on the House floor, with their microphones being cut off whenever they raised the topic, according to WSMV. According to the expulsion resolutions, Jones, Pearson and Johnson “began shouting without recognition” during their protest and “proceeded to disrupt the proceedings of the House Representatives.” Video showed the trio using a bullhorn. Republican leaders in the chamber condemned the lawmakers’ actions and moved quickly to remove their committee assignments and schedule a vote for their expulsion. Jones, Pearson and Johnson decried the Republicans’ actions as oppressive, vindictive and racially motivated. Jones and Pearson are both young, Black men while Johnson is a White woman. Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton called their actions “unacceptable” and argued that they broke “several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor.” During Monday's special meeting of the Metropolitan Council in Nashville, Delishia Porterfield, the person who ran against Justin Jones for the District 52 seat in the primary election and lost, is expected to nominate him to serve on an interim basis, Vice Mayor Jim Shulman told CNN’s Isabel Rosales. If the council successfully suspends the rule prohibiting nominating and appointing an interim representative during same meeting, they will likely vote ""on the board,"" Shulman said. After the votes are counted, the results will be visible on the screen. A simple majority — 21 of the 40 members — is required to appoint Jones. As local leaders in Nashville prepare to potentially send an ousted lawmaker back to the Tennessee House of Representatives, a member told CNN Sunday that he is unaware of any threats of political retribution for their decision. On Saturday, Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Hendrell Remus said Memphis and Shelby counties received threats that they could lose funding if they reinstate the other ousted state representative, Justin Pearson, until holding a special election. “I don't know that, here in Nashville, that we received such threats about nominating Justin Jones back to his seat. But that kind of rhetoric, that kind of threat is very troubling. We need to have good relations between the state and the local municipalities,” Nashville Metropolitan Councilmember Jeff Syracuse said. “If that is the case, they need to stop with those kinds of threats. We need to ensure stability here amongst relations from the state and local municipalities,” Syracuse added. How the vote will work: During Monday’s meeting, the council will vote on whether suspend the rules which typically do not allow a member to be nominated and appointed in the same meeting, Syracuse told CNN. If two or more members oppose that process, the measure will fail. If that happens, it would be at least four weeks until the council could vote to appoint Jones back to his seat, Syracuse said. Syracuse said he did not believe Jones deserved to be kicked out of the legislature. “Justin has a very important voice on this topic ... which is gun control and school safety. So we need him back there. There's an understanding that decorum was broken for sure. But it was an egregious act to actually expel him and Justin Pearson from the legislation. That action did not meet the transgression that, that occurred,” Syracuse said. Justin Pearson, one of two state lawmakers recently ousted from the Tennessee House of Representatives for a gun control protest on the House floor, spoke in an Easter Sunday service at Church of the River in Memphis, thanking the congregation and the community for its support.     ""To District 86 I thank you for believing in me, for entrusting me and expecting me to serve as best as I possibly can,"" Pearson said, during the Sunday service.   ""The Republican-led supermajority of the Tennessee General Assembly sought to have a political lynching of three of its members because we spoke out of turn against the status quo of the government after the tragic death of six people in the shooting of the Covenant school in Nashville,"" he said. Pearson referenced Martin Luther King Jr., noting the civil rights leader was killed on April 4, 1968, in Memphis.    ""Fifty-five years ago this week, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by gun violence. I tell you what: His words, from what he spoke just days before he was assassinated, are still true. The movement lives or dies in Memphis.""      Pearson repeated the phrase, ""The movement lives or dies in Memphis,"" as applause erupted throughout the church.    Jason Pearson, the Memphis lawmakers' father serves as pastor of the Community of Faith Christian Church. Before his son spoke, he led the congregation in prayer, and told the crowd: ""There have been some hard days and some difficult moments.""    ""When somebody is crucifying your baby, it's hard to be silent,"" Jason said.   ""I got to use my voice in this moment because that's all I've got,"" he added. ""I don't have any power. I don't have any other way to stop them from crucifying my baby but I'm going to say and let him that his family is standing with him.""  The Tennessee House had only expelled two other representatives in the last 157 years, and the move required a two-thirds majority vote of the total membership. Just hours after the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Democratic lawmakers, their pictures and profiles had already been removed from the state’s General Assembly website, a symbol of the vacant seats that now need to be filled. Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were kicked out of the legislature by their colleagues in a vote Thursday. Focus in Tennessee is now on filling those two new vacancies.  Special election to come: According to the Tennessee Constitution, since there are more than 12 months until the next general election in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats. No date has been set for a special election but state law says the governor should schedule them within 55 to 60 days. Temporary appointments: In the time between when a seat becomes vacant and when a special election can be held, “the legislative body of the replaced legislator’s county of residence at the time of his or her election may elect an interim successor,” the state Constitution says. For Jones’ District 52 seat, the local legislative body is Nashville and Davidson County's Metropolitan Council. The council has scheduled a special meeting on Monday afternoon to address the vacancy and possibly vote on an interim successor. Nashville Mayor John Cooper has expressed his support for Jones and said on Twitter he believes the council will send him “right back to continue serving his constituents.” Jones told CNN’s Don Lemon on Friday that if he’s appointed by the council, he will serve. “I have no regrets. I will continue to stand up for my constituents,” he said. For Pearson’s District 86 seat, the local legislative body is the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in Memphis. Commission chairman Mickell Lowery plans to call a special meeting regarding Pearson’s expulsion, CNN affiliate WMC reported, but the timing of the meeting isn’t yet known. Pearson said he hopes to “get reappointed to serve in the state legislature."" Referring to the Shelby County commissioners, he said: “A lot of them, I know, are upset about the anti-democratic behavior of this White supremacist-led state legislature.” Former Tennessee State Rep. Justin Jones said he would ""most definitely"" serve his district again if appointed to do so. It comes after he and another Black lawmaker were expelled from their seats in the majority-GOP legislature Thursday for peacefully protesting gun violence alongside their constituents.  Jones and the other ousted lawmaker, Rep. Justin Pearson, called for protesters to return to the Capitol when the House is back in session on Monday. ""That's what we were asking for — the most very basic thing was to ban assault weapons so we can stop these mass shootings, instead they responded by assaulting democracy,"" Jones said Friday. ""I think what happened was a travesty of democracy because they expelled the two youngest Black lawmakers, which is no coincidence from the Tennessee state legislature because we are outspoken, because we fight for our district and I will, you know, want to continue to do that whether I'm inside the chamber or outside the chamber,"" Jones said. A third representative on the chopping block, Rep. Gloria Johnson, a White woman, avoided expulsion by one vote. ""They retaliated not because of that one incident of us going to the well and joining those young people protesting gun violence, but because they got tired and did not feel like young Black men have a right to be at the same dais as them,"" Jones said. Nashville's Metropolitan Council will vote next week to appoint an interim representative for Jones' district, a role which Jones said he would happily step back into if he's re-appointed.  ""We will fight for a multi-racial democracy, and so this extreme tactic to expel us and to try to humiliate us has only put a spotlight of the world on Tennessee,"" he said. ""I would go back because … I'm fighting for the future that I want to live in, that I want my children to live in. It's worth whatever sacrifices that we have to give.""  Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were voted out of the Tennessee House after advocating for gun reform without being recognized. The lawmakers' protests followed the recent deadly shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, which killed three 9-year-olds and three adults. Jones, Pearson, and a third Democratic lawmaker — Rep. Gloria Johnson, who did not lose her seat — were accused by Republicans of breaking “several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor,"" Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton said. Tennessee Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison told CNN that the caucus believed the issue did not need to be considered by an ethics committee and accused Jones and Pearson of having a “history” of disrupting floor proceedings. “It’s not possible for us to move forward with the way they were behaving in committee and on the House floor,” Faison said. “There’s got to be some peace.” The chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, Hendrell Remus, called the move a “direct political attack” on the party. “Their expulsion sets a dangerous new precedent for political retribution,” a statement from the party said. “The day that a majority can simply expel a member of the opposing party without legitimate cause threatens the fabric of democracy in our state and creates a reckless roadmap for GOP controlled state legislatures across the nation.” Rep. Sam McKenzie, chair of the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, said the expulsion of Jones and Pearson overshadowed the issue they were protesting. “This was not about that kangaroo court that happened yesterday. This was about those three young children and those three guardians, those three adults, whose lives were taken away senselessly,” McKenzie said. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Nashville Friday to advocate gun control and meet with Democratic state lawmakers, including Jones, Pearson and Johnson, as well as other local advocates. She gave a fiery speech, saying the three lawmakers had led with courage and were reflecting the ""cries,"" ""pleas"" and ""demands"" of their constituents. “We understand when we took an oath to represent the people who elected us that we speak on behalf of them,” she said. ""It wasn’t about the three of these leaders. It was about who they were representing. It’s about whose voices they were channeling. Understand that – and is that not what a democracy allows?” President Joe Biden called the lawmakers' expulsion “shocking, undemocratic and without precedent” and criticized Republicans for not taking greater action on gun reform, according to a statement Thursday. “Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee,” the president said.",0
353,"Italian Coast Guard escorting 1,200 migrants on boats in Mediterranean Sea","The Italian Coast Guard was on Tuesday escorting two boats carrying 1,200 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, as part of a major operation in a region that has seen migrant arrivals spike in the past year.  Emergency workers were racing to rescue a barge with 400 migrants onboard that had ran out of fuel, according to the volunteer-run service Alarm Phone. The Coast Guard told CNN later Monday that it is also escorting another vessel carrying 800 migrants. ""Due to the prohibitive sea conditions, the Peluso ship, the Diciotti ship and the Coast Guard patrol boats are escorting the two units, in difficulty since yesterday, with migrants on board,"" the Coast Guard said on Twitter. ""The ships, carrying 400 and 800 migrants, got into trouble in rough seas on Monday."" Alarm Phone said in a tweet earlier that it had spoken to passengers at 10.56 a.m. local time (4.56 a.m. ET), describing the situation on board as ""dramatic,"" with the boat starting to leak. ""They report several medical emergencies, water filling the vessel and no fuel left. We have informed the authorities,"" Alarm phone said.  The coast guard is traveling next to the boat en route to Italy because an escort is ""safer"" than attempting to rescue those on board in poor weather, said Felix Weiss, a spokesman for Sea-Watch International, a German organization that runs search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.    The migrants had been stranded along an immigration route between Italy and Malta that NGOs have warned is perilously dangerous. The boat with 400 migrants departed from Tobruk, Libya, and had been at risk of capsizing with water in the hull, according to Alarm Phone. The service also said many on board required medical attention, including a child, a pregnant woman and a disabled person.  The Italian Coast Guard also said Monday that more than 1,700 migrants had arrived on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa in the last 48 hours. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, is a major destination for migrants seeking to enter European Union countries. Every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution and poverty risk the treacherous route in search of safety and better economic prospects. In many cases, their vessels are overcrowded and unfit for the journey, and the need to rescue migrants on board often leads to disputes between countries about who should take them in. More than 28,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, according to the country's Interior Ministry -- a significant surge compared to recent years. The number of migrants arriving in Italy this year are the highest seen in the country since 2017, according to figures by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Most arrivals have journeyed from the Ivory Coast, Guinea, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Pakistan.",0
354,"2 Wisconsin police officers and another person were killed in a gunfire exchange during a traffic stop, authorities say","Two police officers and another person were killed in an exchange of gunfire during a traffic stop in northwestern Wisconsin on Saturday, authorities said. The gunfire erupted after an officer from the Chetek Police Department conducted a traffic stop in Cameron around 3:38 p.m. local time, according to a news release from the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Notified of ""concerning behavior,"" the officers were conducting the stop based on a warrant and to check the welfare of the driver, 50-year-old Glenn Douglas Perry. The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday identified the two officers as Chetek Police Officer Emily Breidenbach, 32, and Cameron Police Officer Hunter Scheel, 23. Perry was taken to a hospital and was later also pronounced dead, the news release said. The Wisconsin Department of Justice earlier said it is investigating the incident.  The department's Division of Criminal Investigation ""is continuing to review evidence and determine the facts of this incident and will turn over investigative reports to the Barron County District Attorney when the investigation concludes,"" the news release said.

356,Man accused of stabbing imam at New Jersey mosque pleads not guilty to attempted murder charge,"The 32-year-old man accused of stabbing an imam at a mosque Sunday in New Jersey pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder charge in court Monday afternoon. Serif Zorba was arrested for allegedly stabbing Imam Sayed Elnakib of the Omar Mosque in Paterson. Elnakib, who is in stable condition, was stabbed during the first prayer of the day around 5:30 a.m. while the congregation was kneeling, mosque spokesperson Abdul Hamdan told CNN. Surveillance video of the incident shows a group of worshippers at the mosque positioned in five long rows. As they knelt down in prayer, a person wearing a hoodie in the third row moved to the front of the room, stepping over other worshippers, and then thrust his right hand into the back of the kneeling imam, the video shows. The congregation then rose together, and the assailant tried to push through the crowd and flee out of the back of the mosque, the video shows. Zorba was charged with first-degree attempted murder, third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, according to a news release from the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. Zorba, a native of Istanbul, also pleaded not guilty to the unlawful weapon possession charges. His plea was entered Monday by a public defender on Zorba's behalf.  The suspect appeared in court before Paterson Municipal Court Judge Vincenzo Stampone wearing an orange jumpsuit, with his long hair mostly covering his face. Zorba communicated with court officials through a Turkish translator.  When Stampone asked Zorba about his current address, Zorba indicated that he lived in Paterson but did not offer a proper address.  Zorba is being held on pretrial detention. His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday.   The prosecutor's office said they could not provide any further details on Zorba's possible motive, citing the ongoing investigation.  The maximum sentence for his alleged crimes is around 26 years, according to the release.",0

358,Shark bite leaves surfer in Hawaii in serious condition,"A surfer has been hospitalized in serious condition following an encounter with a shark off the south shore of Oahu in Hawaii, according to a spokesperson for Honolulu Emergency Services. Shayne Enright told CNN on Sunday morning, a 58-year-old man was bitten by a shark while surfing in Kewalo Basin. Enright credited other surfers around the victim with helping to save his life. She said they were able to tourniquet his right leg while still in the water and help him to shore. First responders transported the man to a hospital in serious condition. Enright said he stayed awake and conscious throughout treatment and transport. The shark is believed to be about an eight-foot tiger shark based on witness accounts, she said. Following the incident, lifeguards posted signs throughout the south shore warning of a shark in the area and set up jet-ski patrols in the water to monitor for additional shark activity, according to Enright. An incident list on the Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Aquatic Resources page indicates it is the fourth shark encounter in Hawaii this year. It's only the second incident in the Kewalo area since 2002.",0

361,What markets are watching after digesting the US jobs data,"In an unusual coincidence, the US jobs report was released on a holiday Friday — meaning stock markets were closed when the closely-watched economic data came out.  It was the first monthly payroll report since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It also marked a full year of jobs data since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in March 2022. While inflation has come down and other economic data point to a cooling economy, the labor market has remained remarkably resilient.  Investors have had a long weekend to chew over the details of the report and will likely skip the typical gut-reaction to headline numbers.  What happened: The US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, showing that hiring remained robust though the pace was slower than in previous months. The unemployment rate currently stands at 3.5%. Wages increased by 0.3% on the month and 4.2% from a year ago. The three-month wage growth average has dropped to 3.8%. That's moving closer to what Fed policymakers ""believe to be in line with stable wage and inflation expectations,"" wrote Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in a note.  ""That wage data tends to suggest that the risk of a wage price spiral is easing and that will create space in the near term for the Federal Reserve to engage in a strategic pause in its efforts to restore price stability,"" he added. The March jobs report was the last before the Fed's next policy meeting and announcement in early May. The labor market is cooling but not rapidly or significantly, and further rate hikes can't be ruled out.  At the same time Wall Street is beginning to see bad news as bad news. A slowing economy could mean a recession is forthcoming. Markets are still largely expecting the Fed to raise rates by another quarter point. So how will they react to Friday's report? Before the Bell spoke with Michael Arone, State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist, to find out.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Before the Bell: How do you expect markets to react to this report on Monday? Michael Arone: I think that this has been a nice counterbalance to the weaker labor data earlier last week and all the recession fears. This data suggests that the economy is still in pretty good shape, 10-year Treasury yields increased on Friday indicating there's less fear about an imminent recession.  There's this delicate balance between slower job growth and a weaker labor market without economic devastation. I think this report helps that.  As it relates to the stock market, I would expect the cyclical sectors to do well — your industrials, your materials, your energy companies. If interest rates are rising, that's going to weigh on growth stocks — technology and communication services sectors, for example. Less recession fears will mean investors won't be as defensively positioned in classic staples like healthcare and utilities.  Could this lead to a reverse in the current trend where tech companies are bolstering markets? Yes, exactly. It's difficult to make too much out of any singular data point, but I think this report will hopefully lead to broader participation in the stock market. If those recession fears begin to abate somewhat, and investors recognize that recession isn't imminent, there will be more investment.  What else are investors looking at in this report? We've seen weakness in the interest rate sensitive parts of the market — areas that are typically the first to weaken as the economy slows down. So things like manufacturing, things like construction. That's where the weakness in this jobs report is. And the services areas continue to remain strong. That's where the shortage of qualified skilled workers remains. I think that you're seeing continued job strength in those areas.  What does this mean for this week's inflation reports? It seems like the jobs report just pushed the tension forward.  it did. I expect that inflation figures will continue to decelerate — or grow at a slower rate. But I do think that the sticky part of inflation continues to be on the wage front. And so I think, if anything, this helps alleviate some of those inflation pressures, but we'll see how it flows through into the CPI report next week. And also the PPI report. Is the Federal Reserve addressing real structural changes to the labor market?  The Fed was confused in February 2020 when we were in full employment and there was no inflation. They're equally confused today, after raising rates from zero to 5%, that we haven't had more job losses. I'm not sure why, but from my perspective, the Fed hasn't taken into consideration the structural changes in the labor force, and they're still confused by it. I think the risk here is that they'll continue to focus on raising rates to stabilize prices, perhaps underestimating the kind of structural changes in the labor economy that haven't resulted in the type of weakness that they've been anticipating. I think that's a risk for the economy and markets. More trouble for commercial real estate  A few weeks ago, Before the Bell wrote about big problems brewing in the $20 trillion commercial real estate industry.  After decades of thriving growth bolstered by low interest rates and easy credit, commercial real estate has hit a wall. Office and retail property valuations have been falling since the pandemic brought about lower occupancy rates and changes in where people work and how they shop. The Fed's efforts to fight inflation by raising interest rates have also hurt the credit-dependent industry. Recent banking stress will likely add to those woes. Lending to commercial real estate developers and managers largely comes from small and mid-sized banks, where the pressure on liquidity has been most severe. About 80% of all bank loans for commercial properties come from regional banks, according to Goldman Sachs economists. Since then, things have gotten worse, CNN's Julia Horowitz reports.  In a worst-case scenario, anxiety about bank lending to commercial real estate could spiral, prompting customers to yank their deposits. A bank run is what toppled Silicon Valley Bank last month, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a recession. ""We're watching it pretty closely,"" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, a wealth manager. While he doesn't expect office loans to become a problem for all banks, ""one or two"" institutions could find themselves ""caught offside."" Signs of strain are increasing. The proportion of commercial office mortgages where borrowers are behind with payments is rising, according to Trepp, which provides data on commercial real estate. High-profile defaults are making headlines. Earlier this year, a landlord owned by asset manager PIMCO defaulted on nearly $2 billion in debt for seven office buildings in San Francisco, New York City, Boston and Jersey City. Dig into Julia's story here.  What will become of tech earnings? Tech stocks led market losses in 2022, but seemed to rebound quickly at the start of this year. So as we enter earnings season, what should we expect from Big Tech? Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, says that he has high hopes.  ""Tech stocks have held up very well so far in 2023 and comfortably outpaced the overall market as we believe the tech sector has become the new 'safety trade' in this overall uncertain market,"" he wrote in a note on Sunday evening.  Even the recent spate of layoffs in Big Tech has upside, he wrote.  ""Significant cost cutting underway in the Valley led by Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and others, conservative guidance already given in the January earnings season 'rip the band- aid off moment', and tech fundamentals that are holding up in a shaky macro [environment] are setting up for a green light for tech stocks.""",0
362,American offices are half-empty. That could be the next big risk for banks,"From Dallas and Minneapolis to New York and Los Angeles, offices sit vacant or underused, showing the staying power of the work-from-home era. But clear desks and quiet break rooms aren't just a headache for bosses eager to gather teams in person.  Investors and regulators, on high alert for signs of trouble in the financial system following recent bank failures, are now homing in on the downturn in the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market. Just as lenders to the sector grapple with turmoil triggered by rapidly rising interest rates, the value of buildings such as offices is crashing. That could add to pain for banks and raises concerns about damaging ripple effects.  ""Although this is not yet a systemic problem for the banking sector, there are legitimate concerns about contagion,"" said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. In the worst-case scenario, anxiety about bank lending to commercial real estate could spiral, prompting customers to yank their deposits. A bank run is what toppled Silicon Valley Bank last month, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a recession in the United States. Asked about the danger posed by commercial real estate, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last month that banks remained ""strong"" and ""resilient."" But attention is growing on the links between US lenders and the property sector.  ""We're watching it pretty closely,"" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, a wealth manager. While he doesn't expect office loans to become a problem for all banks, ""one or two"" institutions could find themselves ""caught offside.""  America's top banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, told CNN Thursday that he couldn't be sure whether more banks will fail this year. Yet he was quick to point out that the current situation was very different to the 2008 global financial crisis, when there were ""hundreds of institutions around the world with far too much leverage."" The US market looks most vulnerable. Yet the European Central Bank and Bank of England have also recently warned of risks tied to commercial real estate as the outlook for prices deteriorates. Work-from-home bill comes due Commercial real estate — which spans offices, apartment complexes, warehouses and malls — has come under substantial pressure in recent months. Prices in the United States were down 15% in March from their recent peak, according to data provider Green Street. The rapid increase in interest rates over the past year has been painful, since purchases of commercial buildings are typically financed with large loans. Office properties have been getting hammered the hardest. Hybrid work remains popular, affecting the rents many building owners can charge. Average occupancy of offices in the United States is still less than half March 2020 levels, according to data from security provider Kastle.  ""You have fundamentals under pressure from work from home at a time when lending is less available than [it has been] over the last decade,"" said Rich Hill, head of real estate strategy at Cohen & Steers. ""Those two factors will lead to a pretty significant decline in valuations."" Trouble may build as the economy slows. Hill thinks US commercial property valuations could fall roughly 20% to 25% this year. For offices, declines could be even steeper, topping 30%. ""I'm more concerned than I've been in a long time,"" said Matt Anderson, managing director at Trepp, which provides data on commercial real estate. Signs of strain are increasing. The proportion of commercial office mortgages where borrowers are behind with payments is rising, according to Trepp, and high-profile defaults are making headlines. Earlier this year, a landlord owned by asset manager PIMCO defaulted on nearly $2 billion in debt for seven office buildings in San Francisco, New York City, Boston and Jersey City. What it means for banks This is a potential problem for banks given their extensive lending to the sector. Goldman Sachs estimates that 55% of US office loans sit on bank balance sheets. Regional and community banks — already under pressure after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March — account for 23% of the total. Signature Bank had the tenth biggest portfolio of commercial real estate loans in the United States at the start of the year, according to Trepp. First Republic, which received a $30 billion lifeline last month from JPMorgan Chase and other major banks, had the ninth largest. But both had a much a greater share of their assets tied up in real estate than bigger rivals such as Wells Fargo, the leading US lender to the sector. The rise in commercial property prices over the past decade has provided developers and their bankers with a measure of protection. But pain could increase in the coming months.  About $270 billion in commercial real estate loans held by banks will come due in 2023, according to Trepp. Roughly $80 billion, nearly a third, are on office properties. Plummeting valuations will make refinancing tougher for property owners, who are likely to face requests from banks to put up more equity. Some owners — especially of older, less desirable office buildings — might decide it's not worth the expense given the market climate and simply hand back the keys. Banks may prefer that option to kickstarting drawn-out, expensive foreclosure processes. But it puts them in the difficult position of owning depreciating properties. ""That is a scenario we will see now very often,"" Christian Ulbrich, chief executive of global commercial real estate services giant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), told CNN. The question, he continued, is what lenders will do in that situation, and whether banks are sitting on such sizable loan portfolios that they need to take ""significant losses."" Keeping watch Banks have less capacity to stomach financial blows these days. Smaller institutions are grappling with outflows of deposits to larger peers and money-market funds offering better returns. Plus, bank investments in government bonds, once considered low-risk, are notching up losses as interest rates climb. The worst outcome, according to Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, is that a ""doom loop"" develops. Questions about the health of banks with sizable exposures to commercial real estate loans cause customers to pull deposits. That forces lenders to demand repayment — exacerbating the sector's downturn and further damaging the banks' financial position. That triggers more deposit outflows in a ""vicious cycle."" That is not the central expectation right now. Since the 2008 financial crisis, banks have tightened lending standards and diversified their clientele. Loans for offices account for less than 5% of US banks' total, according to UBS. And Ulbrich of JLL said that while the speed at which borrowing costs have risen has put significant pressure on the commercial real estate industry, it has lived with rates at this level for ""most of its history."" ""There's always a risk for self-fulfilling prophecies here, but I would still be fairly optimistic things will play out in a digestible way,"" Ulbrich said. The likeliest outcome is thought to be an uptick in defaults and reduced access to funding for the commercial real estate industry. Banks, it's predicted, will weather the storm, though their earnings may take a beating. That doesn't mean, however, there won't be spillovers. ""Distress of this type has historically not only hurt the landlords and the bankers who lend to them,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note to clients this month. Non-bank lenders, related businesses and investors may also be hurt, she said.",0
363,India's endangered tiger population is rebounding in triumph for conservationists,"Tigers once roamed across Asia, their numbers as high as 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, before the species plummeted to the brink of extinction. By 2006, their population in India -- home to the majority of the world's remaining wild tigers -- hit a record low of just 1,411 individuals. But decades of conservation efforts appear to have finally paid off. India's tigers have more than doubled since then, reaching 3,167 last year, according to the latest tiger census released Sunday. That's about 70% of the world's wild tiger population, which stands at around 4,500, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The resurgence of Indian tigers represents a triumph for conservationists, and a ray of hope for other countries struggling to boost wildlife numbers. The report was released alongside celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of Project Tiger, the government's conservation program launched in 1973. ""We have thousands of years of history related to tigers ... The tiger is considered our brother in many tribes,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address on Sunday. ""A better future for humanity is only possible when our environments are protected and our biodiversity continues to expand."" Modi also visited two tiger reserves on Sunday, with photos showing the leader decked in a safari hat and camouflage clothing. Tigers in decline Tiger numbers began falling steeply in the 1940s as human populations boomed. Agricultural expansion, deforestation, and infrastructure have fragmented tiger habitats, according to the WWF -- particularly devastating given tigers are solitary animals who require large territories to roam and hunt.  Today, tigers exist on just 7% of the land they used to occupy, according to the WWF. This dwindling space has meant a rise in human-tiger conflict, with multiple incidents in the past few decades of tigers attacking humans and entering villages in search of food. And they're not alone -- India's endangered elephants, too, frequently wander into farmlands and devour crops. Though environmental degradation is a problem facing countries worldwide, India's exploding population poses a unique challenge. In 1971, the country had 547 million people; it now has 1.4 billion, and is set to overtake China to become the world's most populous country this year. Unregulated poaching in the 1980s further accelerated the decline in tiger numbers. Tigers were hunted for sport, status and consumption, with their bone and other parts often used in traditional Chinese medicine. India officially banned tiger hunting in 1972, but it remains a major threat, with illegal poaching blamed for the complete extinction of tigers within an Indian reserve in 2005. Success story Efforts to reverse the trend has seen India develop 53 tiger reserves covering nearly 75,800 square kilometers (about 7.5 million hectares), up from just nine reserves at the start of Project Tiger.  Authorities have relocated and paid entire villages to make space for tigers, and created wildlife corridors to link their fragmented habitats.  The government has also invested in technology like drones, camera traps and software systems to keep track of tiger populations, movements and behaviors. There are plenty of challenges ahead, the WWF cautioned. The worsening climate crisis spells trouble for vulnerable habitats. Many tiger reserves and protected areas are ""small islands in a vast sea of ecologically unsustainable land use,"" with human activity encroaching on tiger environments. And illegal poaching continues despite strict laws. Still, the return of the tiger population is encouraging -- and India is beginning to share its conservation practices with other countries with declining tiger numbers. In recent years, Delhi has signed bilateral agreements and launched initiatives including conservation workshops with Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Bhutan. And, as Modi pointed out in his Sunday address, similar successes are being seen with other species; India welcomed its first newborn cheetahs in March more than 70 years after the big cats were declared officially extinct in the country. The cubs were born to two rehabilitated cheetahs brought from Namibia to India, as part of a government plan to re-home 50 individuals over the next five years.",0

366,Tesla is opening a Megafactory for huge batteries in China,"Tesla will open a Megapack battery factory in Shanghai, it said on Sunday, as it doubles down on its investment in China even as political tension rises between Beijing and Washington. The news was announced just days after Airbus unveiled plans for a second final-assembly line in the country's north, with officials publicly rolling out the welcome wagon for foreign investors. The Tesla factory will be able to produce 10,000 Megapacks, which are very large batteries used to store huge amounts of electricity, the company said in a tweet. It announced the new factory with a picture of a signing ceremony in China.  ""Tesla opening Megapack factory in Shanghai to supplement output of Megapack factory in California,"" Elon Musk said on Twitter. Megapacks are meant to be used as massive batteries to help stabilize energy grids. Each unit can store enough energy to power an average of 3,600 homes for one hour, the company says. They are designed for utilities and large-scale commercial projects, not vehicles. Chinese state media outlet Xinhua was the first to report the news, saying the electric automaker will break ground in this year's third quarter and begin production in the second quarter of 2024. The Shanghai facility would have the same level of production capacity as Tesla's Megafactory in Lathrop, California — equivalent to 40 gigawatt-hours of energy storage. ""We believe this announcement is a potential game changer for Tesla on the battery front,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""In this EV [electric vehicle] arms race Tesla is further building its lead in battery technology with the new Megapack factory in China another flex the muscle moment for Musk."" Last month, Apple's Tim Cook visited Beijing in show of support for the country as a market and manufacturing base amid escalating political rhetoric between the United States and China. Second Shanghai factory  The Megafactory will be located in Lingang, an enormous free trade zone on the outskirts of Shanghai, where Tesla's electric-vehicle Gigafactory broke ground in 2019. That facility was built within 10 months, at 65% of the cost of the Model 3 production plant in the United States. Within a few years, it became the biggest EV production plant on the planet. The Shanghai facility is Tesla's main export hub, supplying vehicles to most markets outside of North America. Tesla is also making inroads among Chinese drivers. Last week, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said the company sold 88,869 units of Shanghai-made EVs in March. According to Reuters, that figure was 35% higher than a year ago.  Tesla is the second largest EV maker in the country behind market leader BYD, which sold 206,089 units last month.  In January, Tesla slashed prices in China for the second time in less than three months, in an effort to boost sales as amid slowing demand in the world's largest car market. The cuts came days after Beijing ended a 13-year-long subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, a move that is expected to put further pressure on car demand. The Chinese government had planned to phase out its costly EV subsidy program by the end of 2020, but extended it during the pandemic to avert a sharp economic slowdown. For 2023, the CPCA estimates sales of ""new energy cars,"" which are mostly EVs, to reach 8.5 million units, which will account for 36% of total car sales, according to the official China Securities Journal. Total passenger cars sales in China hit 20.5 million units in 2022, up just 1.9% from the year before, the association was quoted as saying, as the country dealt with the impact of strict Zero-covid controls that were relaxed only late in the year.  — Chris Isidore and Laura He contributed to this article.",0

368,See where abortions are banned and legal — and where it's still in limbo,"Following the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, more than a dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to the procedure.  Nine states, including Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri, have banned abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Mississippi's near-total ban has an exception for rape but not incest. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity. Health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced. In South Carolina, the state's Supreme Court overturned a six-week ban in January 2023, concluding in a 3-2 decision that the law violated the state constitution's privacy protections. Georgia's six-week ban was blocked in November by a state court, but days later, Georgia's Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect while an appeal by the state plays out. The state's Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case in March, and a ruling is expected in the next six months. A district judge in Wyoming also temporarily blocked the state's new abortion ban days after it went into effect in March, meaning abortion remains legal until viability for now. As these legal challenges make their way through the courts, patients seeking access to the procedure must navigate a complicated patchwork of legislation, often requiring them to travel hundreds of miles.

370,Record warmth in areas with a record snowpack may cause hazardous flooding this week,"This week will be draining in a literal sense, due to rapid snowmelt. A great thaw is set to begin, which will bring the potential for flooding across at least 10 states. From the West Coast to the Great Lakes, concern is growing about the significant warmup forecast this week and what impact it will have on the near-record snowpack for many regions. ""Between 5,000 feet and 7,000 feet snowpack is currently near to above record levels, with 8 to 15 inches of water contained within this snow,"" the National Weather Service office in Billings explained. Record highs are possible across the Northern Plains and Midwest this week, as temperatures climb into the 60s and 70s. The sudden warmth combined with heavy rain from an approaching cold front could lead to rapid snowmelt, causing rivers and creeks to flood quickly; something forecasters have been expecting with this year's blockbuster winter snowpack. ""Minneapolis had their third-snowiest winter on record, so a lot of it was sitting around waiting to melt,"" Eric Ahasic, a weather service meteorologist in Twin Cities, said. ""We didn't really add a ton of heavy rain on top of the snowpack while that snow was melting, so that kind of allowed it to progress fairly orderly, but we're going to have some minor flooding in a lot of rivers."" He explained the perfect ingredients will exist this week for a rapid melt: warm temperatures, humid air, windy conditions and a strong sun angle. Ahasic fears areas to his north will have a much more difficult time with all this melting snow. North Dakota and Minnesota could see more significant flooding where the rivers flow to the north. ""As that water flows into the Red River, and then flows north up into Canada, it's going to run into colder weather and even some ice farther north,"" Ahasic explained. ""That's why you usually get some really bad flooding up across that part of the United States and Canada, because the water that's flowing is running into usually some sort of ice blockage."" The blockages are often referred to as ice jams, which happen when huge chunks of ice clump together and block the flow of the river, which many times results in rapid flooding. In portions of the Northern Plains, temperatures could climb to 80 degrees this week, possibly setting records. Any snow left on the ground will melt quickly with temperatures running at least 15 degrees above normal. ""With the ground mainly frozen in the foothills, this water will not be able to soak in and will run off,"" the weather service in Billings said. ""Water flowing downhill and accumulating in low-lying areas may result in localized flooding."" The weather service urges people to stay up to date with the flooding situation over the next few weeks, in case any rivers begin to rapidly rise. In portions of the southern Sierra, the rate of melting snow will also begin to rapidly increase this week, causing rivers to rise and run more swiftly. The weather service warns people to stay vigilant in the lower elevations and campsites, because of the potential for flash flooding. ""Due to their swift currents and very cold-water temperatures, creeks and streams pose life-threatening dangers,"" the weather service office in Las Vegas warned. While the snow is beginning to melt more quickly this week, it will be something to follow for the next several weeks and even months.",0
371,Sandstorm hits Beijing and northern China for the fourth time in a month,"A severe sandstorm has cloaked Beijing and China's northeastern regions for the fourth time in a month forcing some residents to stay indoors to protect themselves from dense air pollution. Images showed the Chinese capital engulfed in a cloud of orange haze on Monday which hung thick in the air into Tuesday, though conditions have begun to ease. Beijing authorities told children and the elderly to stay indoors, and healthy adults were advised to refrain from outdoor activity. Residents were also reminded to keep their windows shut and wear masks and face shields. On Monday, the air quality index soared to ""severely polluted"" levels, according to Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.  Concentrations of PM10 particles exceeded 1,321 micrograms per cubic meter at 9 p.m. on Monday, according to the center -- almost 30 times the daily average guideline of 45 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.  PM10 are particles of pollution that are less than 10 micrometers in diameter and can irritate your eyes and nose and travel to your lungs.  Even smaller particles referred to as PM2.5 can travel deeper into your lungs and potentially enter your bloodstream. Levels of PM2.5 have been ""hazardous"" in Beijing for some of the past 48 hours, according to the Air Quality Index, which monitors real-time air quality in major cities worldwide. Beijing is regularly hit with sandstorms in the spring with the smog made worse by rising industrial activity and rapid deforestation throughout northern China. The latest sandstorm is the fourth to hit the country since March 10, and the eighth since the start of the year, state media reported. The most severe sandstorm so far this year occurred on March 22, when PM10 particles hit 1,667 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.   This time, the affected areas stretched as far south as Shanghai to parts of Heilongjiang, the country's northernmost province, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. Other areas affected included Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia,  Shanxi, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and Hubei, according to the national observatory.  China's National and Grassland Administration said sand and dust from the southern part of Mongolia and the western part of Inner Mongolia were carried southeast by air currents, triggering the present storm.  One Chinese internet user on Weibo, China's heavily censored equivalent of Twitter, complained about the pungent smell.  ""It smells very earthy,"" she said.  Another user compared the storm to the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner"" and urged others to ""just wear protection"" when going out.",0
372,An Alaska man receives a heart transplant after missing his first opportunity due to severe weather,"More than three months after Patrick Holland's first shot at getting a heart transplant was ruined by winter weather that upended his travel and prevented him from getting to the Washington state hospital in time, the Alaska man has been given a second chance.  The father of seven is among the thousands of people in the Pacific Northwest whose flights were canceled or redirected in December as severe storms swept through the region. But even after his airline jumped through hoops to reschedule Holland on subsequent flights, they were all canceled. The heart transplant was given to somebody else.  Determined to not miss his next opportunity, Holland temporarily relocated from his home near Fairbanks to live near the transplant hospital in Seattle so he could be available at a moment's notice. There, he was staying with a family who heard about his story on the news.  In the passing months, a few hearts became available for Holland, who has congestive heart failure, but none of them was viable.  Finally, a fifth call came last week alerting Holland to a potential transplant, and everything fell into place. ""It really didn't feel real until he told me, 'They told me I have like 20 minutes to say goodbye because we're going in for intubation,' and then a nurse came into the room, and he had to hang up,"" Holland's wife, Haley Holland, told CNN. When her husband called back, the couple had just seconds to speak before he had to go again. ""I barely had time to tell him that I loved him,"" said Holland, who has been documenting the family's transplant journey on Facebook. She and her children flew to Seattle to be with Patrick after the surgery last Friday. Haley Holland has been giving each potential donor, whose names are not typically shared with their organ recipients, an imagined name of her own.  Her husband is now recovering at the University of Washington Medical Center with a heart transplant from the donor she has dubbed ""Andrew.""  ""Number five --  Andrew, as we affectionately call this donor unless we become blessed enough to find out his true name -- was the perfect one,"" Haley Holland wrote in a Facebook post. In the days since the transplant, Haley Holland has felt and listened to her husband's new heartbeat. ""It feels like a miracle,"" she told CNN, adding that with the help of a nurse, she first felt her husband's new heartbeat through a pulse on his foot. On Saturday, she used a stethoscope to hear the beating.  ""It just makes you cry because this isn't the heart that he was born with. It's not the heart that he spent 57 years with. This is someone else's heart. And so it's very touching and it's miraculous that Patrick now has this new heart that he'll be able to enjoy life with."" Though the surgery was successful, Patrick Holland's recovery is just beginning. In a Tuesday Facebook update, his wife said he has been able to stand but still has uncomfortable IV ports and extreme he nausea that is making eating difficult. By Thursday, Holland was progressing in his recovery, according to Dr. Claudius Mahr, his cardiologist at the UW Medicine Heart Institute. ""He's pretty much progressing as one would expect,"" Mahr told CNN. ""There's always a few bumps in the road with surgeries like this, but he's generally trending in the right direction.""   Mahr said Alaska is one of several states without a heart transplant program, and patients often come to Washington for care. Doctors at the UW Medicine perform among the highest volume of heart transplants in the country, according to the hospital's website.  Following the surgery, Haley Holland created a GoFundMe to support the family's expenses. Her thoughts have also been with his heart donor. ""Remembering that this is Andrew's heart and that someone had to pay the ultimate price,"" she said. ""Someone had to wmake an enormous sacrifice in order for this miracle to happen. So, it's a very emotional thing, feeling the pulse or listening to the heart."" Patrick Holland told CNN in December that he had a ""massive heart attack at 29"" followed by a series of heart-related complications. He said he dreamed of keeping up with his children, who then ranged in age from 3 to 36.  Following the transplant, Haley Holland said her husband is thankful. ""Even in the worst times he will look at me and he'll say, 'It was worth it,'"" she said. As of January, 3,365 patients were on the waiting list for a heart nationwide, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. Mahr urged people to become organ donors. ""You can save multiple people's lives.""  Correction: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the volume of heart transplants UW Medicine performs. It is among the highest in the US.",0
373,"New Jersey imam in stable condition after being stabbed during morning prayer service, local officials say","An imam is in stable condition after being stabbed during a Sunday morning prayer service at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, according to local officials. Imam Sayed Elnakib was stabbed during the first prayer of the day, around 5:30 a.m., at Omar Mosque in south Paterson while the congregation was kneeling for prayer, mosque spokesperson Abdul Hamdan told CNN.  The suspect, who was unknown to congregants prior to Sunday's incident, was performing prayers and ""lunged forward with a knife and stabbed Imam Sayed multiple times -- at least twice,"" Hamdan said. After the incident, the suspect attempted to flee from the mosque but congregants ""were able to bring him down and apprehend him and hold him"" until police arrived and arrested him, he said. There were more than 200 congregants in the mosque at the time of the stabbing, Hamdan said. The spokesperson said he strongly believes that this was an isolated incident and assured all congregants ""that the mosque is safe and to practice their faith, it is open."" Mayor Andre Sayegh said he visited Imam Sayed Elnakib in the hospital soon after the incident. The mayor said the imam is in stable condition at St. Joseph's University Medical Center.  CNN has contacted the medical center and did not receive an immediate response. Sayegh said Elnakib was ""in better spirits than before"" Sunday afternoon and is being treated for a punctured lung. The mayor said a suspect was detained, but their motive is not clear. The stabbing occurred during Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2023, it runs from March 22 to April 20.  In a news conference Sunday, Sayegh commended the efforts of worshipers who apprehended the attacker and announced that there would be increased police presence at Paterson mosques. ""We appreciate the efforts of those here who were able to apprehend the assailant and we also want to reassure the family, the congregation at the mosque, that there will be extra police attention,"" the mayor said.  ""This is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar year and we want to make sure that the safety of those that are just coming to pray is a priority for us and that we take this situation very seriously,"" he continued. ""We want to let anyone who is coming to worship know that they can do this in peace without any fear of being attacked."" The Paterson Police Department was taken over by the state attorney general's office in late March, due to a ""crisis of confidence"" in the city's law enforcement, the office said at the time. The attorney general's office told CNN the stabbing is being investigated by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for further details. Councilman Al Abdel-aziz, who represents the area where the attack happened, said in a Facebook update that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the stabbing. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by this tragic event,"" he said. ""While it is unclear what motivated the attacker, there is no justification for violence of any kind, especially in a sacred space."" ""I am relieved to hear that Imam Sayed Elnakib is in stable condition, and wish him a full and speedy recovery,"" the councilman added. ""Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time. As a community, it is important that we come together to support one another and denounce all forms of hate and violence."" A day earlier, the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for a hate crime investigation after a separate incident in Paterson. The chapter said a sign at the Dr. Hani Awadallah public school in Paterson was defaced. In a statement Saturday, the chapter's executive director. Selaedin Maksut, said, ""While the circumstances surrounding the incident remain unknown, the smearing of the word 'Allah' in Dr. Awadallah's name is apparently intentional, with the remainder of the sign left untouched, making an immediate hate crime investigation into this incident necessary."" ""In 2022, we've recorded the highest number of complaints of anti-Muslim prejudices, at 152,"" Maksut said. ""Over the years, our records have shown that complaints increase around and during Ramadan, in part because Muslims are more visible and take up more space -- physically and metaphorically.""  During the month of Ramadan, worshipers eat and hydrate before sunrise and fast until sunset. Worshipers also engage in other forms of practice including increased prayer, giving more to charity, volunteering and participating in communal meals. Paterson is a city with a population of more than 150,000, according to the US Census Bureau, about 15 miles north of Newark.  The city is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the state of New Jersey and that New Jersey has more Muslims per capita than any other state in the nation, according to Maksut. Later Sunday, Hamdan performed the second prayer of the day at Omar Mosque, he said, along with 300 to 400 other worshipers. Prayers will continue throughout Sunday and moving forward, the spokesperson added. ""We urge everyone to allow this incident to even get them closer to their religion, to God, to visit the congregation more often and not allow this to bring them away,"" Hamdan said. ""This is a time of unity and peace, and this incident should not in any way take that away from us. We feel safe here at the mosque.""",0

375,WWE apologizes for using footage of Auschwitz in promotional spot,"World Wrestling Entertainment apologized Friday after using footage of Auschwitz, the infamous Nazi concentration and extermination camp, in a promotional spot for a hyped father-son match.  On Twitter, the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum said it was hard to call it an ""editing mistake."" ""Exploiting the site that became a symbol of enormous human tragedy is shameless and insults the memory of all victims of Auschwitz,"" the organization tweeted.  The promotional video for WrestleMania 39 featured WWE wrestler Dominik Mysterio, who has an ongoing rivalry with his father, Rey Mysterio, and was ""arrested"" in December for pushing him. ""You think this is a game to me. I served hard time. And I survived,"" the younger Mysterio said. The ad then cuts to photos of prisons, one of which was Auschwitz, where Nazis murdered over 1 million people. ""We had no knowledge of what was depicted,"" the WWE said in a statement to CNN. ""As soon as we learned, it was removed immediately. We apologize for this error.""  The gaffe quickly caught the attention of social media users.  In later airings and reruns of the first night of WrestleMania, the footage showed an image of barbed wire. WWE is known for its outlandish storylines. In this father-son rivalry, Dominik eventually turned on Rey, culminating in an altercation on Christmas Eve. The gag was that though Dominik only spent a few hours in prison, he took on a hardened criminal persona.  Rey beat Dominik on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles to ""teach him a lesson about respect.""  WWE said WrestleMania 39 was the most successful and highest-grossing event in company history, with over 500 million views and 11 million hours of video consumed over the two days.",0
376,The latest on hybrid work: Who is WFH and who isn't,"As the economy slows, are employers starting to regain the upper hand in negotiations with employees and job seekers? Pay is always an issue, of course, but in the wake of the pandemic, so too is how much time employers want people to work on site versus how much they are willing to let employees work remotely.  Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 27.5% of private-sector businesses reported that their employees worked from home or another remote location some or all of the time between August 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022.  In other words, 72.5% of private-sector organizations — up from 60% in the July-to-September 2021 period — said they did not have employees working remotely. That percentage struck work-from-home researchers and observers as surprisingly high, given what other studies and surveys have found. (More on those in a minute.) Private sector businesses employ a majority of US workers and, according to the Pew Research Center, 61% of workers do not have jobs that can be done remotely. But it's worth noting that the BLS findings did not measure teleworking arrangements at federal, state and local government employers, at nonprofit organizations or among the self-employed. The BLS survey also interpreted respondents' answers as referring to a company's formal telework policies, not whether some employees informally work remotely on occasion, such as responding to work emails from home.  ""To the extent that 'work from home' would include an individual who checks their email after hours, we purposefully did not want to capture that type of informal work activity in the estimates as this would likely be included in the 'rarely or never' category,"" a BLS spokesperson said in an email to CNN.  What others have found  Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom said he finds it hard to infer much from the BLS's 72.5% finding, because he contends respondents must have misread the survey's very first question, which said, ""Do any employees at this location currently telework in any amount?"" In his view, ""any amount"" includes answering work emails or taking a work call from home.  Semantic concerns aside, however, the confusion and surprise over the BLS finding is a reminder that there is still no standard or easy way to measure the full extent of remote work in a post-pandemic world. Other surveys and studies of people who work for all employers — not just those in the private sector — suggest telework for those whose jobs can be done remotely remains common in this post-pandemic period.  The Pew Research Center, for instance, found in a nationally representative survey of US full-time working adults conducted in February that 41% of workers with jobs that can be done from home are now working a hybrid schedule. That is up from 35% in January of last year. Among hybrid workers who are not self-employed, 63% said their employer requires them to come into the workplace with some regularity; 59% say they typically work from home three or more days a week.  That suggests the push by top employers — such as Disney, Amazon, Apple, as well as several Wall Street banks — to get employees back into the office three or more days a week may not have moved the needle much.  Meanwhile, Kastle Systems, which operates card-swipe security machines in office buildings across the United States, said that the weekly average office occupancy rate at the end of March in the most populous U.S. cities was 49% of pre-pandemic levels. While that's much higher than the occupancy rates recorded during the height of the pandemic, it's still a very long way from occupancy rates recorded back in February 2020 just before the pandemic hit. The latest results from the monthly Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA), which Bloom and other researchers have conducted since May 2020, found that the overall average number of paid days worked from home in 2023 so far is 1.4 per week (or 28% of the workweek). That's based on responses from Americans aged 20 to 64 who earned $10,000 or more the prior year.  The same survey respondents said their employers plan to allow employees to work remotely 2.2 days a week, for those who can. That's up from the 1.6 days expected back in August 2020, although below the expected 2.4 days recorded in June 2022. SWAA found that working from home is most prevalent in cities and in sectors like technology and information, finance and insurance, and professional and business services. That is somewhat similar to the BLS finding that telework is most common in the following industries: information, professional and business services, educational services and wholesale trade.  Hybrid is here to stay, but fully remote work is declining Remote work experts strongly assert hybrid schedules will remain a permanent feature of work in the United States for a host of reasons — including better worker engagement and retention — even if the parameters and kinks are still being worked out in real time. ""Companies are still trying to figure it out,"" said Sara Sutton, CEO of remote-work jobs platform FlexJobs, which she founded 16 years ago. But, Sutton added, ""Hybrid is where things will settle."" When it comes to the overall average of how often employers are likely to let employees work from home, Bloom believes it will be 25% of the week. ""I have talked to hundreds of organizations about WFH [working from home] over the past three weeks, and this is now clearly stabilizing to a post-pandemic norm,"" he said in an email. Fully remote jobs, meanwhile, will remain but may become less prevalent than they have been of late. In Pew's February survey, 35% of people who could work remotely were doing so full time, down from 55% in October 2020, but still well above the 7% of people working remotely full-time before the pandemic.",0
377,The city without TikTok offers a window to America's potential future,"Across the United States, more than 150 million people are being faced with the possibility of a new reality: life without TikTok. The wildly popular short-form video app has been at the center of an ongoing battle, with lawmakers calling for an outright ban, and the company portraying itself as a critical community space, educational platform and just plain fun.  In Hong Kong, there's no need to imagine that reality: TikTok discontinued its services there in 2020. Its abrupt departure was met with mixed reactions: disappointment from some users and content creators, but also relief from others who say life is better without the app's infinite scroll. At the time of its exit, TikTok had a relatively modest presence in the city and was not ubiquitous like it is in the US today. But the varied reactions to its departure, and the way users have pivoted to other platforms or even real-life offline communities, offer Americans a glimpse into their potential TikTok-less future. Lost opportunities TikTok announced its exit from Hong Kong in July 2020, a week after China imposed a controversial national security law in the city. The decision came as the app tried to distance itself from China and its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, in the face of growing pressure in the US under the Trump administration. But it meant a jarring halt for creators like Shivani Dukhande, who had roughly 45,000 followers at the time the app left Hong Kong. Dukhande, 25, saw her account take off in early 2020 during the pandemic, with lifestyle content such as cooking and wellness videos flourishing on the platform. ""There were a lot of new creators emerging,"" she said. ""We used to all collaborate together, we had a [group] chat where we would all speak and share ideas and it created a community."" Momentum began to build. Companies started reaching out to Dukhande, paying for sponsored content and collaborating on ad campaigns. Brands began partnering with creators on trending ""challenges"" in a bid to attract young new consumers. ""More people were joining and it was becoming such a fun thing to do,"" she said. ""Then, it just kind of went away one morning."" ""If it continued, then I probably could have made enough to have quit my 9 to 5,"" she said. ""If I had the chance to grow, it could have been a potential career path."" This is one of the main arguments TikTok has made in recent weeks in the US. In March, as the company's CEO prepared to testify before Congress, TikTok produced a docuseries highlighting American small business owners who rely on the platform for their livelihoods. The platform is used by nearly five million businesses in the US, TikTok said in March. And it's set to surpass rivals: London-based research firm Omdia projected in November that TikTok's advertising revenues will exceed the combined video ad revenues of Meta -- home of Facebook and Instagram -- and YouTube by 2027. This is partly because people are spending more time on TikTok. In the second quarter of 2022, TikTok users globally spent an average of 95 minutes per day on the app, according to data analytics firm SensorTower -- nearly twice as much time as users spent on Facebook and Instagram. But in Hong Kong, other platforms have jumped in to fill the gap. Reels, Instagram's short-form video product, with similar features as TikTok such as an endless scroll, is growing quickly -- and Dukhande has gotten on board.  She had to rebuild her audience from scratch, and now has 12,500 Instagram followers, but she feels optimistic about its growth. Still, the loss of TikTok was a ""missed opportunity,"" she said, and the burgeoning community of creators has largely faded from sight. ""The amount of jobs, the amount of content creation, the amount of marketing opportunities that were there with TikTok -- we sort of missed out on that whole chunk of it."" Are the kids alright? But for some people, TikTok's departure was a welcome change. Poppy Anderson, 16, has been using TikTok since its launch in 2018. And, like many others in her generation, she would spend hours ""scrolling and scrolling"" -- even when feeling unfulfilled. ""It was very easy to kind of find exactly what you like on there, because the [algorithm-run] For You page kept you there,"" she said. ""And it's entertaining, but you don't really get anything from it."" She described TikTok as often being a toxic environment that breeds narrow thinking, herd mentality, a misguided ""cancel culture"" and inappropriate online behavior such as critiquing the bodies of girls and women. Even people she knew in real life began acting differently after joining the app, which strained friendships, she said. Martin Poon, 15, also grew weary of TikTok, but it was hard to quit.  ""Everyone was using it, so I feel like there was a sense that you have to use it, you have to be on top of things, you have to know what's going on. And I think that was stressful to me,"" he said.  Misinformation and misogyny ran rampant on TikTok, with accounts like those of  Andrew Tate, the self-styled ""alpha male"" recently detained in Romania on allegations of human trafficking and rape, gaining popularity among boys at Poon's school.  ""It's just concerning how [these accounts] have so much impact on the youth, and it has so much grip on what we think and how it affects our behavior,"" said Poon -- though he added that misinformation is a major problem on all social media platforms, not just TikTok. Experts have long worried about the impact of TikTok on young people's mental health, with one study claiming the app may surface potentially harmful content related to suicide and eating disorders to teenagers within minutes of them creating an account. In response to growing pressure, TikTok recently announced a one-hour daily screentime limit for users under 18, though users will be able to turn off this default setting. Anderson acknowledged some positives about TikTok, like open conversations about mental health. Still, she was glad when the app became inaccessible. Falling asleep became easier without the lure of TikTok. ""I didn't have the self control to get off it on my own,"" she said. Exploring passions For Poon and his friend Ava Chan, also 15, TikTok's disappearance sparked new beginnings. When the app left in 2020, they were doing online classes, isolated from friends and bored at home. At the time, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts had yet to arrive in Hong Kong. ""We had to figure out how to use our time other than being on TikTok,"" said Chan. ""For us, that was exploring our passions more."" For both, that came in advocating for the neurodiverse community. They launched a club at school that spreads education and awareness about neurodiversity, as well as participating in volunteer activities with neurodiverse people. Both said it lent them a sense of purpose, and as time went on, they saw other benefits. Their friends, who would previously spend time filming and watching TikToks together, began having more face-to-face conversations. They noticed peers begin exercising outdoors more, which was made easier as Covid restrictions lifted. Their mental health improved. Of course, being teenagers, they're not off social media entirely and use it as a tool to promote their club -- but it's far from the previous hours of scrolling. And while they occasionally wonder what's happening on TikTok outside Hong Kong, the allure of it is lost when nobody else around them uses it either. ""A lot of people, they've just kind of forgotten about it,"" said Anderson. ""People move to different platforms -- or just move on.""",0

379,"Snoop Dogg, his ape and a question of celebrity hype","The question of whether Snoop Dogg deeply and sincerely liked some cartoon apes has become key in a federal lawsuit between the crypto empire Yuga Labs and the trollish artist Ryder Ripps.   Yuga Labs v. Ripps is a fight over trademarks, but legal filings in the case are pulling back the curtain on the year of mania around the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of cartoon apes.  The Bored Apes became some of the most famous NFTs after a series of celebrities said they got one. Snoop — not a plaintiff or defendant in the case — was one of the most famous and vocal owners of an ape. But Ripps' team says Snoop's love of the apes was not genuine, but bought and paid for by Yuga Labs — and federal regulations require celebs to disclose paid endorsements. Court documents filed by Ripps' lawyers claim Snoop was paid ""around $1 million"" to perform as a Bored Ape at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2022. The rapper did not disclose the payment in conjunction with his performance. Representatives for MTV did not respond to CNN's questions about Snoop's compensation for the appearance.  Celebrity-paid promos were part of the success of the broader crypto industry too, as revealed in the fallout from the collapse of FTX in November. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged eight celebrities for not disclosing they were paid to promote cryptocurrencies. Further, Snoop — along with several other celebrities and crypto firms — is facing a class action lawsuit filed in December that alleges he was part of a scheme to artificially inflate the price of Bored Apes with inauthentic celebrity hype.   The rapper's representatives did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  He told CNBC in an interview published in June last year that his interest in crypto focused on the intellectual property rights (IP) that came with it. ""Being able to own and control the whole IP and not be used as a face or marketing tool or, you know, someone as an ambassador, but to actually be the owner, the CEO,"" he replied when asked why he got into crypto.   The Bored Ape craze Bored Apes were already a craze — with many sports and entertainment stars using them for social media profile pics and more — when Ripps copied them last year. He sold his versions as RR/BAYC with an accompanying website that detailed claims the Bored Apes contained references to racist memes on 4chan, a troll website.  Yuga Labs sued Ripps not for defamation, but for trademark infringement.  Yuga didn't have registered trademarks, so it had to argue in court that consumers associate the company with its logos and apes. It did that, in part, by pointing to the many celebrities who publicly talked about Bored Apes.   Ripps' lawyers counter that the celebrities were paid to promote the apes without disclosing it, and therefore Yuga has ""unclean hands"" — a legal principle meaning that if the apes got their fame improperly, it can't be used to assert trademark rights.  Court documents recently filed by Ripps' lawyers state, ""Snoop Dogg created a music video featuring a BAYC image and performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in a performance using a BAYC image."" The filing further alleges: ""Yuga did not disclose its cash payment to Snoop Dogg for the endorsements, nor did it disclose that Snoop Dogg was a Yuga investor"" in connection with the performance. Yuga Labs previously told CNN that the celebrities were not paid to promote the Bored Apes.  Guy Oseary, a Hollywood agent who sits on Yuga's board and invested in the company, also told CNN the celebrities were not paid. But the Ripps filings say Oseary stated in a deposition ""he believes Snoop Dogg was paid around $1 million for 'financial support to do the video and performance...'""  Oseary did not respond to a request for comment on this subject. Oseary's deposition in the Ripps case has been sealed, at the request of Yuga Labs. A few hours after the filings were posted, Ripps' lawyers said they'd made an error in failing to redact the documents. A lawyer for Ripps told CNN he could not comment on the issue.   Yuga Labs initially declined to comment to CNN. After publication, a spokesperson sent the following statement: ""Defendants Ripps and [Jeremy] Cahen included verifiably false information in their court documents based on a twisted interpretation of the facts. Yuga Labs is proud of the investors and partners who share our vision for web3. The fact is that Yuga has never paid anyone to join or promote the club, and despite all the false allegations, Yuga has never given Apes to celebrities. When our seed round took place, we publicly and proudly announced our investors — including Snoop Dogg. Our involvement in his and Eminem's performance at the MTV VMA was well known and publicized before, during and after the show."" In a court filing posted Monday, Yuga said the description of Oseary's statements was ""incomplete and misleading,"" though it did not offer contradictory statements from his deposition. Yuga also said the Snoop information poses a danger of ""unfair prejudice and confusing the issues.""  John Jasnoch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the separate class action lawsuit, has been watching the Ripps case closely. ""The recent filings in the Ripps case provide a unique insight into the web of interconnected financial interests between the entertainment industry and predatory crypto venture capital,"" Jasnoch said.  Jasnoch pointed out that the sum Snoop allegedly received — around $1 million — is much more than the money paid to other celebrities who got busted for undisclosed crypto promo. Kim Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax; the SEC fined her $1.26 million for not disclosing it last October. Lindsay Lohan was allegedly paid $10,000 to tweet about Tronix crypto tokens; the SEC charged her with illegally touting it without disclosure in March and ordered her to pay more than $40,000. Former NBA player Paul Pierce was paid $244,000 to promote EthereumMax; in February he agreed to pay $1.4 million for not disclosing it.  Failure to disclose In the press release about the Pierce fine, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, ""This case is yet another reminder to celebrities: The law requires you to disclose to the public from whom and how much you are getting paid to promote investment in securities, and you can't lie to investors when you tout a security.""  There is no indication that Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, is the target of any investigation or facing any federal accusation of wrongdoing. When CNN asked if Snoop Dogg was being investigated, the SEC issued its usual response that it would not comment on any specific case. The FTC also would not comment on a specific case. In general, an FTC spokesperson said, ""if there's a connection between an endorser and a marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed.""  The government views shilling for makeup or shoes as different from shilling for crypto. The SEC says cryptocurrency is a security -— an investment product that requires more extensive disclosures from an endorser. The SEC has not yet said whether NFTs — unique digital files bought and sold in crypto — are securities. Ripps' team says they are, and at least one federal court has recently agreed that NFTs can be securities, depending on how they're traded. Yuga says they're not.   Whether NFT issuers must make SEC-required disclosures can also have serious implications for regular people trying to make a quick buck on the internet. Molly White, a Harvard fellow and a critic of the crypto industry, told CNN some firms operated under a ""greater fools"" strategy — that to profit from their crypto products, they needed to bring in a wider and wider audience to offload them onto. Iconic celebrities brought in the widest audience possible.  Snoop's potential liability In their live/video hybrid performance at the VMAs, Snoop and Eminem morph into their Bored Apes as they rap about smoking weed and being rich. Snoop did not say he was paid, though Yuga asserted in court documents that Yuga's name appeared in the end credits of the awards show broadcast.  When looking at whether Snoop could be in regulatory trouble, there are a few questions to keep in mind, according to Charles Whitehead, a professor of business law at Cornell Law School. ""If Snoop is getting paid to promote the NFTs, then the first thing you'd have to decide is as a securities law matter, is it a security? If the answer is yes — and the SEC position has been in most of these cases, yes — then the question is, is he somehow conditioning interest in investing in securities?""   If Snoop were paid to say he'd invested in Bored Apes and they're really cool, ""That looks like it crosses the line at both the federal and the state level. ... He's got to disclose that this is a paid sponsorship and the amount that he's getting paid,"" Whitehead said.   Only dancing around as a Bored Ape, and not talking about it, ""looks a lot less like an endorsement, and looks a lot less like you are promoting an investment in the security,"" Whitehead said. That would be unlikely to raise SEC or FTC issues, he said. You are allowed to get paid to perform in a logo. You could ride around MTV's stage in a little wooden wagon for Wells Fargo.   But, there's another complicating layer. What if you've promoted an investment on social media — as Snoop did throughout 2022 — but you only get paid to dance around in the investment's logo in a video? ""Paid for the video but not paid for the tweets? Well, I mean, nudge nudge wink wink,"" Whitehead said. ""If the substance is that I'm in fact getting paid to tout the security, even if the contract says I'm only getting paid for the video — too bad, so sad. You cannot get around the law that easily.""  The overlapping lawsuits provide a window into the overlapping interests of the people involved. When Snoop got his Bored Ape in December 2021, he tweeted the image and thanked MoonPay, a crypto payments firm that says its ""concierge service"" allows wealthy people to buy NFTs without setting up a crypto wallet. In March 2022, Snoop invested in Yuga Labs, and the month after, he invested in MoonPay. Court documents filed by Ripps' lawyers say Snoop also invested in Yuga as ""an indirect investor through the investment fund Sound Ventures,"" which is run by Guy Oseary, the Hollywood agent on Yuga's board. Sound Ventures invested in Yuga and MoonPay. MoonPay also invested in Yuga. One of MoonPay's crypto wallets spent $15 million on Bored Apes.  In the VMAs video, Eminem turns into a white ape wearing ""hip hop clothes,"" while Snoop becomes a cheetah-fur ape wearing a ""pimp coat,"" according to Yuga Labs' description. Eminem rapped, ""I was penniless, now I'm plenty rich. And the sh*t don't make any sens",0

381,Where jobs were gained and lost in March,"The latest monthly jobs report showed that US hiring slowed in March but remained robust, with gains in service-providing businesses like bars and restaurants, but weakness in construction and manufacturing. Leisure and hospitality fueled last month's growth in payrolls, a trend that has held firm since the economy started its recovery from the pandemic. Government employers and the professional and business services industry also hired at a solid clip last month. But employment shrank in construction, manufacturing, and nondurable goods. Here's a look at where employment grew last month and where it shrank, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' report. Strongest gains Leisure and hospitality employers added 72,000 jobs last month, the most of any industry. But the sector is still 2.2% below pre-pandemic staffing levels and added a smaller-than-average number of jobs in March than in the six prior months. ""The gains we continue to see in health care and leisure and hospitality are because those industries are still trying to recoup earlier losses,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. ""So, the services sector held up but showed some signs of cooling."" Government employers added 47,000 jobs in March, led by hiring from state and local governments, which typically struggle to add workers in a tight labor market. Health care businesses added 34,000 jobs and employment in the business services sector — which includes many white-collar jobs such as accountants, engineers, and consultants — grew by 39,000. Government jobs also remain 314,000, or almost 1.4%, below their pre-pandemic level. Some weakness Cracks are beginning to form in the goods-production part of the labor market, however. The construction industry lost 9,000 jobs in March, the first decline in construction employment in more than a year and the largest job loss in the sector since May 2021 -— though still a drop of just under 1.1%. Demand for housing tanked at the end of last year when aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve pushed up borrowing costs for home buyers. But while new residential construction has slowed over the past year, construction jobs have held up, mostly because of a backlog in construction projects, Swonk said. She added that the March decline in construction employment is attributed to weak demand for housing and ""unusually harsh spring weather."" One other casualty of the Fed's rate hikes is manufacturing, which also lost jobs last month, according to the BLS. ""Manufacturing is one of the most interest-rate sensitive industries, as much as technology and financial services, so it's not surprising to see the job losses there,"" said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter. Data from the Institute for Supply Management released this week showed that the manufacturing sector contracted in March for the fifth month in a row. The survey's index fell to its lowest level since May 2020. The nondurable goods industry also saw a pullback in hiring, which was likely due to weaker consumer demand for clothes and household products, Buber added. ""Those goods are a bit more responsive to any changes in the market, and that's why we're seeing that industry respond faster than durable goods,"" Buber said. Temporary jobs also declined by nearly 11,000 in March, which could be an indicator that the labor market is going to soften further in the coming months, according to Beth Ann Bovino, US chief economist at S&P Global. ""If you start to see a reduction in temporary hires, that usually means that businesses are seeing some softness in the revenue stream, which is one of the first signs of an easing in the jobs market,"" Bovino said.",0
382,"4 dead, including a child, following overnight domestic violence incident and police shooting in Orlando","A child and two adults were fatally shot in a domestic violence incident overnight Sunday in Orlando, and the suspect then died in an ""officer-involved shooting"" after firing at police, the Orlando Police Department said. Orlando officers responded to a home in reference to a domestic violence incident at approximately 2:25 a.m. Sunday. Shortly after arriving, officers heard shots from inside the house and the suspect came out of the house, firing shots at the officers, police said. ""The suspect walked out of the house, walked toward the officers and shot at the officers. The officers returned fire and the suspect fell,"" Orlando Police Chief Eric D. Smith said. The suspect was detained and transported to a local hospital, where he died. The two officers involved were not injured, police said. When officers entered the home, they found three people with gunshot wounds, including a child, who were transported to a local hospital by officers. Police said all three victims have since died. The officers have been placed on paid administrative leave and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will conduct an independent review of the incident, followed by the State Attorney's Office, according to the release.

More than 99% of Service Employees International Union Local 99 members voted to approve the new agreement in voting held between April 3 and 7, per the union, which represents about 30,000 Los Angeles school custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers and other student services staff.  The board of the Los Angeles Unified School District also has to vote on the agreement, which the union said includes: • A 30% wage increase, bringing the average salary from $25,000 to $33,000  • A $1,000 bonus for those who worked during the Covid-19 pandemic  • Fully paid family health care benefits that will be expanded to teachers' assistants and after-school program workers, among others • Increased hours for workers like special education assistants ""This contract recognizes the essential work of those who work hard to ensure students can learn in a clean, safe, and supportive environment,"" Max Arias, SEIU Local 99 executive director, said in the release.  ""It is a major step forward with significant improvements to wages, work hours, and benefits for dedicated education workers who have been left behind for far too long.""

389,"6 injured in a shooting on a South Carolina beach during high school senior skip day, police say","Six people were injured in a shooting after fights broke out on a South Carolina beach Friday while high school seniors were skipping school before spring break was set to start, police said. Hundreds of people were at the beach in the coastal city of Isle of Palms, about 15 miles east of Charleston, when gunfire erupted around 5:20 p.m. ET Friday, Police Chief Kevin Cornett said during a news conference. The chief said the shooting began amid several fights among people who were participating in senior skip day. Cornett said five of those injured were around the age of 18. One adult woman in her mid-30s or early 40s was also wounded, Cornett added. Some of the injured were taken to a hospital while others went on their own. All injuries were non-life-threatening, according to city officials. Five of those injured were released from hospital by Saturday, Isle of Palms City said in a news release. The other remains in stable condition. Two individuals were charged in the incident: a 16-year-old for unlawful carry of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm, and an 18-year-old for unlawful carry of a firearm, the release said. However, authorities have not confirmed if either was involved in the shooting. Police continue to investigate, the police chief said.",0

391,"Palestinian teen killed, Israeli woman dies of wounds as West Bank violence simmers","Israeli forces shot and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in the Aqbat Jaber refugee camp near the occupied West Bank city of Jericho, Palestinian officials said, as violence in the region continued to simmer on Monday.  Mohammad Fayez Balhan was ""killed by live occupation bullets in the head, chest and abdomen,"" the ministry said, adding that two other people were injured by live ammunition and sent to a hospital in Jericho for treatment. The Israeli military said they raided the camp to arrest a ""terror suspect.""  ""During the activity, violent riots were instigated in a number of locations,"" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""As the soldiers left the area, suspects opened fire toward them, hurled explosive devices and Molotov cocktails. The soldiers responded with live fire and .22 caliber ammunition. Hits were identified.""  Tensions in Israel and the occupied West Bank have spiraled in the aftermath of recent Israeli police raids on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.  Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh warned that images of Israeli forces storming the mosque had ""created an incredible mood of anger among every Palestinian, wherever they are -- in Gaza, in Ramallah, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Syria,"" and called on Israel to deescalate the situation. ""There is a mood of anger that is there in the heart and mind of every Palestinian,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.    Over the last week, dozens of rockets were launched from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria into Israeli territory, followed by Israeli retaliatory strikes.  On Friday, a vehicle hit a group of tourists in Tel Aviv, killing one Italian national, in what Israeli authorities described as a terror attack. Two sisters, aged 15 and 20, with dual British-Israeli citizenship were also killed Friday in a shooting attack in the West Bank. On Monday, the mother of the women, Lucy Dee, succumbed to wounds sustained during the shooting.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the shooting as a ""severe terrorist attack.""  ""On behalf of all citizens of Israel, I convey heartfelt condolences to the Dee family on the passing of the mother of the family, Leah (Lucy), who was murdered in the severe terrorist attack in the Jordan Valley last Friday, together with her two daughters Maia and Rina,"" Netanyahu said in a statement Monday.     Netanyahu on Friday instructed Israeli police ""to mobilize all border police units in reserve and the IDF to mobilize additional forces in face of terrorist attacks,"" according to his office. The Israeli military said it was on high alert, calling up an unspecified number of reservists amid what it described as ""very volatile times."" Also on Monday, thousands of Israeli settlers staged a march to Evyatar, an illegal settler outpost in the occupied West Bank that has been a flashpoint for Israel's settler movement. Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Givr, among those who have spearheaded a campaign to legalize the outpost, was among the protesters. Evyatar sits on a hilltop, along a corridor linking Tel Aviv to the Jordan Valley, known locally as Jabal Subeih. Palestinians who say they own land in the site have been holding counter-protests.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians close to the nearby town of Beita led to nearly hundreds of injuries, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.  The Palestinian Red Crescent said 216 people were injured in the clashes, including 22 people hit by rubber bullets which, they say, were fired by Israeli forces. Three people were transferred to hospital, it also said. In a statement, the IDF said ""a violent riot"" had been instigated near Beita, adding that ""rocks were hurled at the soldiers, lightly injuring two IDF soldiers"" and ""security forces at the scene responded with riot dispersal means."" Asked about video shared on social media that appeared to show Israeli forces throwing tear gas canisters at journalists in the area, the Israel Police released a statement saying it ""appears that the security forces failed to adhere to the established rules and guidelines"" in ensuring freedom of the press. Palestinians in Beita, which is just south of Nablus, say they own the land at Evyatar.  Israeli settlers left Evyatar in 2021 after a deal with the government of then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The buildings remained as part of the government's deal with the settlers. ""The land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel, belongs to us,"" Knesset member Ariel Kallner, of Netanyahu's Likud party, told CNN. ""I think that those who live here, the Arabs and so on, they can live here. But it's our land.""  Under international law, both the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered occupied territory and settlements there illegal, which Israel disputes.  Nabil Abu Radina, a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the march as an ""invasion of settler militias, led by ministers from the Israeli occupation government."" Abu Radina also demanded than ""immediate and quick intervention"" by the US government to ""stop this madness for which the entire region will pay the price.""",0

Police were called to the Christiana Mall in Newark around 6:43 p.m. local time Saturday, where they found three individuals with gunshot wounds in the area of the food court. They were all taken to area hospitals, two of them in critical condition, said Delaware State Police Senior Cpl. Jason Hatchell. Five other people were also taken to a hospital after they ""sustained various injuries not related to gunfire,"" the corporal said. No shooting suspect was in custody Saturday night, Hatchell said, adding that ""it has not been confirmed how many suspects were involved. Investigators are actively working to identify the suspects."" The shooting was not a random one, Hatchell said. ""Investigators believe this is a result of an altercation between several suspects and at least one of the victims,"" Hatchell said. With the investigation still in its early stages, Hatchell said it's unknown whether any of the victims and suspects knew each other previously. The shooting prompted police to evacuate and close the mall as law enforcement converged on the scene, which was searched and cleared. ""There is no threat to public safety,"" the corporal said later Saturday. Investigators were still on scene collecting evidence, examining surveillance video and speaking with witnesses Saturday, and the the mall will stay closed Sunday as the investigation continues, Hatchell said.

394,"Almost 90% of US mpox-related deaths were in Black men, and nearly all had weakened immune systems, CDC reports","Almost 90% of mpox-related deaths in the United States were among Black men, and nearly all had weakened immune systems, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From May 2022 to March 2023, 30,235 people in the US were diagnosed with mpox, previously known as monkeypox. Thirty-eight deaths were linked to mpox; 36 of them were men, and 33 were Black men. The average age of those who died was 34. Mpox spreads through close contact, and it can infect anyone. during the 2022 outbreak, infections were mostly among gay or bisexual men or other men who have sex with men.  Most people hospitalized for severe cases of mpox were Black men with uncontrolled HIV that may have caused a weakened immune system, according to the report, which was published Thursday. Although most of the people who died got one or more prompt treatments and intensive care, nearly a quarter had delays of three to seven weeks from diagnosis to treatment, and two got no treatment for mpox. ""These findings highlight the importance of integrating prevention, testing, and treatment for multiple sexually associated infections,"" the report says. ""Equitable access to prevention, treatment, and engagement and retention in care for both mpox and HIV should be prioritized, particularly among Black men and other persons at risk for sexually associated infections."" A separate CDC report published Thursday urged equity-based strategies, such as tailored messages and expanded vaccine services, to increase vaccination among racial and ethnic minorities.  Early in last year's outbreak, vaccination rates were lower among Black and Hispanic men than among White men, but by August, rates among Black and Hispanic men exceeded those among White men. However, the vaccination-to-case ratio was lower among Black and Hispanic men, and vaccination rates were not proportionate to the ""elevated incidence rates"" among Black men, the report said, leaving vaccination needs unmet.  Between May and December 2022, 723,112 people in the US received the first of two doses of the mpox vaccine, and 89.7% of the doses were given to men.  ""Continued implementation of equity-based vaccination strategies is needed to further increase vaccination rates and reduce the incidence of mpox among all racial and ethnic groups,"" the report says.  More than 30,000 people have been diagnosed with mpox in the United States as of Wednesday, and 42 people have died, according to the CDC.",0
395,"Suicide rises to 11th leading cause of death in the US in 2021, reversing two years of decline","The suicide rate in the United States returned to a near-record high in 2021, reversing two years of decline, according to a report released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Final data for the year shows that suicide was the 11th leading cause of death nationwide, with more than 14 deaths for every 100,000 people. The death rate has increased 32% over the past two decades, and the 4% jump between 2020 and 2021 was the sharpest annual increase in that timeframe. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 34 and fifth for people ages 35 to 54. The suicide death rate was four times higher among men than women in 2021, CDC data shows, as it has been in many years prior. Rates increased significantly for men of most ages between 2020 and 2021 but were relatively unchanged for women of most ages, except for a significant rise among those 75 and older. Rates were highest among American Indian people -- about twice as high as average for men and three times as high for women -- and rates spiked about 17% between 2020 and 2021. Rates also increased significantly for Black and White men and women. Another report published Thursday by the CDC shows that adolescents were the age group most likely to visit the emergency department for suicidal thoughts in recent years. Children are facing increasing mental health challenges, with significant shares of both teen girls (57%) and boys (29%) saying they felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021. Nearly 1 in 3 teen girls said they seriously considered attempting suicide, a recent CDC survey found. But growing demand for services is matched with a nationwide shortage of beds for children who need mental health help, leaving many children waiting in emergency department beds and crowding hospitals.",0
396,"When children are told they were born via assisted reproduction can affect outcomes, study finds","At age 14, Helen wasn't bothered by the fact she was born via surrogacy. ""My mum is still my mum. My dad is still my dad,"" she told UK researchers conducting a study on the mental health and well-being of children born through egg donation, sperm donation and surrogacy. Helen is not her real name. ""I was talking to someone at school and they said they were an accident,"" 14-year-old Simon (also not his real name) told the researchers. ""I know I was no accident, I was really wanted, and it makes me feel special.""  Parents worried their children may experience difficulties as a result of learning they were conceived by assisted reproduction can stop fretting — the kids are just fine, according to the study published this week after two decades in the making.  ""When we began this study more than 20 years ago, there was concern the absence of a biological link between the child and the parents could have a damaging effect on their relationship and on the well-being of the child,"" said lead author Susan Golombok, professor emerita of family research and former director of the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge in the UK. However, at age 20, children born via egg or sperm donation and surrogacy were psychologically well-adjusted, the study found, especially if parents told the children about their birth history before age 7. ""What this research means is that having children in different or new ways doesn't actually interfere with how families function. Really wanting children seems to trump everything — that's what really matters,"" Golombok said.  Clinical psychologist Mary Riddle, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University called the study ""important, in that it represents research conducted over a long period of time."" However, Riddle, who was not involved in the study, said the results aren't completely applicable to the United States because surrogacy can be practiced differently in the UK in several ways. Called ""tummy mummies"" by some of the children, surrogates in the UK may become part of the family, participating in the upbringing of the child they helped bring into the world, according to Golombok's 2020 book, ""We Are Family: The Modern Transformation of Parents and Children."" ""In the UK, intended parents often know their surrogate prior to the surrogate pregnancy whereas in the US, commercial surrogates are often matched through agencies and don't have prior relationships with the families for whom they carry babies,"" Riddle said. It's also more common in the UK to use ""partial"" surrogacy, in which surrogates are impregnated with the sperm of the intended father and are therefore the biological mother of the child, Riddle said.  ""Here in the US, gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother has no genetic connection to the child she is carrying, is far more common and thought to be potentially less fraught with psychological and legal pitfalls,"" she added. Telling a child early helps The study, published Wednesday in the journal Developmental Psychology, followed 65 children — 22 born by surrogacy, 17 by egg donation and 26 by sperm donation — from infancy until age 20. Another 52 families who did not use any assistance were also followed. Researchers spoke to the families when the children were 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Young adults who learned about their biological origins before age 7 reported better relationships with their mothers, and their mothers had lower levels of anxiety and depression, the study found. However, children born through surrogacy had some relationship issues around age 7, ""which seemed to be related to their increased understanding of surrogacy at that age,"" Golombok said.  ""We visited the families when the children were 10, and these difficulties had disappeared,"" she said. ""Interestingly, the same phenomenon has been found among internationally adopted children. It may have to do with having to confront issues of identity at a younger age than other children."" Developmentally, children begin to notice and ask questions about pregnancy between the ages of 3 and 4, said clinical psychologist Rebecca Berry, an adjunct faculty member in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. ""To satisfy their curiosity they'll begin to ask questions about babies and where they came from as a way of trying to understand why they are here,"" said Berry, who was not involved with the study. Children as young as 7 will already have a basic understanding of genetics, and can be surprised when they learn they aren't genetically connected to one or both parents, said Lauri Pasch, a psychology professor at the University of California San Francisco, who specializes in infertility and family building. ""Our current thinking is that it is best for parents to share the story of donor conception with their children at a very early age, so that if I were to ask their child when they are an adult when they learned that they were donor conceived, they would respond that they 'always knew,'"" said Pasch, who was also not involved in the study, via email. ""This allows the child to grow up with the information, as opposed to learning it later in life, when it comes as a surprise or shock and can hurt their trust in their parents and their identity development,"" she added. A few differences When it came to maternal anxiety and depression, there were no differences between families formed by surrogacy and egg or sperm donation and families with children born without assisted conception. Nor were they any differences in the mothers' relationships with their partners at home, the study found. However, mothers who had babies via donor eggs reported less positive family relationships than mothers who used sperm donation, likely due to insecurities about lack of a genetic connection to their children, Golombok said. Young adults conceived by sperm donation reported poorer family communication than those conceived by egg donation, the study found. That's perhaps due to a greater reluctance on the part of fathers to disclose they are not a genetic parent, Golombok said.  Only 42% of parents who had conceived via sperm donor had revealed the child's birth history by the time their children were age 20, compared to 88% of egg donation parents and 100% of  parents who used surrogacy. When asked, many of the children said they weren't concerned about how they were conceived.  ""A lot of the children said 'It's not a big deal. I've got more interesting things going on in my life,' while others said 'Actually it's something a bit special about me. I like talking about it,' Golombok said. ""I think it's really nice to hear from the children themselves and I don't think any other study has done this."" Once told, a child needs to revisit the birth history from time to time, so parents should be sure any conversation is an ongoing one, Golombok said. ""There is this idea parents will tell the child and that is it. But you need to keep having these conversations to give the child a chance to ask questions in an age appropriate way as they grow older,"" she said. ""Many of the parents in our study use children's books that were specifically designed for this purpose,"" Golombok added. ""Then they could bring the child's own story into the narrative.""",0
397,Biden administration declares fentanyl laced with xylazine 'an emerging threat' in the US,"The White House has declared that the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl combined with xylazine -- an animal tranquilizer that's increasingly being used in illicit drugs -- is an ""emerging threat"" facing the United States due to its role in the ongoing opioid crisis.  Administration officials call the threat FAAX, for fentanyl-adulterated or -associated xylazine.  The move, announced Wednesday, marks the first time in history that any administration has declared a substance to be an emerging threat to the country, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 established that the office has authority to declare such ""emerging threats,"" and no administration has used it until now. Last year, Congress declared methamphetamine an emerging drug threat but none have been declared by an administration previously. Under other agencies or in separate circumstances, concerns such as bioterrorism, infectious diseases or climate change may be identified as ""emerging threats."" ""This drug, which is an animal sedative, is being mixed with fentanyl and is being found in almost all 50 states now,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""It's become an important part for us to make sure that we're declaring it an emerging threat."" Now that the administration has declared fentanyl combined with xylazine an emerging threat, it has 90 days to coordinate a national response. ""We are working quickly to develop and implement a whole of government nationwide plan, with real deliverable action, that will save lives and will be published within 90 days of this designation,"" Gupta said. Xylazine, also known as tranq or tranq dope, has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths in the United States due to its rising illicit use. Between 2020 and 2021, overdose deaths involving xylazine increased more than 1,000% in the South, 750% in the West and about 500% in the Midwest, according to an intelligence report released last year by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. And in some cases, people might not even know that xylazine was in the drug they used. Just last month, authorities at the DEA issued a public safety alert about the ""widespread threat"" of fentanyl mixed with xylazine, reporting that in 2022 approximately 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine. Fentanyl, which has been driving the opioid crisis, is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high the drug provides.  Xylazine is not an opioid. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine, typically in horses, but it is not approved for use in humans. And xylazine can do major damage to the human body, including leaving drug users with severe skin ulcers, soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. ""Xylazine is one of the contaminants in fentanyl, but there could be others,"" Gupta said. ""So, I think with the declaration of an emerging threat, we're sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit xylazine and illicit fentanyl that we're going to respond quicker, we're going to match the challenge of evolution of these drugs supply, and that we're going to protect lives first and foremost.""  'There is a shift that is occurring' Now that xylazine has been declared an emerging threat, some of President Biden's $46 billion drug budget request to Congress can be used to respond.  This year, the Biden administration announced that the President has called on Congress to invest $46.1 billion for agencies overseen by the Office of National Drug Control Policy to tackle the nation's illicit drug crisis. If the budget request is not approved, there could be the option to reallocate money within the Office of National Drug Control Policy, but ""we don't want to be in a position where moneys that are being utilized for some other important aspect of saving lives has to be moved away for this purpose,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""That is the reason we are asking Congress to act."" Such funds could be used to test drugs on the street for xylazine, collect data on FAAX, invest in care for people exposed to FAAX and develop potential treatments for a xylazine-related overdose.  The medication naloxone, also known as Narcan, is an antidote for an opioid overdose, but people who have overdosed on a combination of opioids and xylazine may not immediately wake up after taking naloxone, as it may not reverse the effects of xylazine in the same way it does opioids. ""We need to recognize, first of all, that there is a shift that is occurring from organic compounds and substances like heroin and cocaine to more synthetics,"" Gupta said of the state of the nation's illicit drug crisis.  ""Both the types of drugs have changed -- from predominantly organic to predominantly synthetics -- but the way drugs are bought and sold have also changed,"" he said. ""Now, all you need is a phone in the palm of your hand and a social media app to order and buy some of the most dangerous substances on planet Earth."" Rise of synthetic drugs Xylazine is just one of the many adulterants -- or substances that are typically added to others -- found in the nation's illicit drug supply. ""All of a sudden, you can synthesize hundreds of compounds and kind of mix them together and see what does the best in the market,"" Joseph Friedman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in March. ""People are synthesizing new benzodiazepines, new stimulants, new cannabinoids constantly and adding them into the drug supply. So people have no idea what they're buying and what they're consuming."" Some of these adulterants may be as simple as sugar or artificial sweeteners added for taste or additives or fillers that bulk up the drug. Sometimes, they may be contaminants left over from the manufacturing process.  But all of these things can carry real-life health harms, says Naburan Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and senior scientist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Like an opioid, xylazine can depress the respiratory system, so the risk of overdose multiplies when it's combined with heroin or fentanyl. Also, ""in the veterinary literature, we know that it causes a really bad severe form of anemia. And so when people are injecting heroin that's contaminated with xylazine, they can end up with a near-fatal form of blood iron deficiency,"" Dasgupta said in March. ""We had one person here who ended up going to the hospital needing multiple blood transfusions. And it was all because of the xylazine."" Move to make xylazine a controlled substance US lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine as a controlled substance. In March, bipartisan legislation -- the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act -- was introduced in the House and Senate. It describes illicit xylazine as an ""urgent threat to public health and safety"" and calls for it to be a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl. ""Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said in a statement in March. The bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that the product is not being diverted to the black market. ""This bill recognizes the dangers posed by the increasing abuse of animal tranquilizers by drug traffickers, and provides new tools to combat this deadly trend,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the statement.  ""It also ensures that folks like veterinarians, ranchers and cattlemen can continue to access these drugs for bona fide animal treatment.""",0
398,What is autism? An expert explains,"Some individuals with autism have challenges processing senses. Others struggle to communicate. Still others might have a tough time socializing, thinking, physically moving or just going about daily living. People with autism have their own ways of interacting with the world, because autism is a developmental disability that affects everyone who has it a little differently, according to Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia Macdonald distinguished professor of human genetics, neurology and psychiatry at UCLA. Geschwind has spent 25 years studying autism and what causes it. To mark Autism Awareness Month, CNN  talked with him about what autism is and what causes it. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What is autism?  Dr. Daniel Geschwind: Autism refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills and social and communication and repetitive behaviors, resistance to changes in routine, or restricted interests. I prefer to call it ""the Autisms,"" because it's not one thing, and no two autistic children or adults are exactly alike even though they may share basic features. People with autism may also have some sensory-motor integration issues, especially sensory hypersensitivity.   CNN: How prevalent is autism today? Geschwind: It isn't rare. The most recent statistics (from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) came out in March, pulled data from 11 sites (in the United States) and reported 1 out of every 36 kids is autistic. The study before that estimated around 1 in 40. About 10 years ago, the autism rate was 1 in 100, or even lower.  It would be easy to look at this trend and say autism is increasing, but that's not really what is happening. The most recent data reflects that our ability to recognize autism and diagnose it early has improved dramatically. We're now able to diagnose people with autism who might have (previously) fallen through the cracks. Everybody is neurodivergent to some extent. For example, if you look at a simple IQ test, a substantial portion of people will perform really badly on one specific item. That doesn't mean they have problems — it's just that it means we all have strengths and weaknesses. If I were being tested on artistic ability, for example, or engineering ability, I would be far below what's called typical. I think we have to accept that intelligence is not just one thing, that cognition isn't one thing, that there's not just one way to behave. CNN: What does it mean when people describe some as being ""on the spectrum""? Geschwind: About a decade ago, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" was adopted to encompass everything that we called autism into one rubric. The intent was simply to describe the variability in how people with autism act and behave biomedically. There are some autistic individuals who just need accommodations and don't need treatment. There are other autistic individuals who need a lot of treatment. The spectrum was intended to include them all.  Over time, non-autistic people began referring to the spectrum in a linear fashion: high to low. That means some autistic individuals were categorized as ""high-functioning,"" while others were categorized as ""low-functioning."" For many, the notion of a spectrum is now a loaded term. Many believe that instead of talking about autism in a linear fashion, we should talk about it as a wheel or pie, where each slice represents a different trait and every individual has different strengths and weaknesses.   CNN: Is there a cure for autism? Geschwind: There is no cure. At the same time, we've come very far in understanding what autism is, and we're making progress on how to treat it. When I started researching autism 25 years ago, the autism rate was 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 2,000. To put it in deeper historical perspective, I think at that time there was only about $10 million a year or less in autism research being done that was funded (by the National Institutes of Health). And so, there was a huge disconnect between the research dollars, public awareness and the real needs of patients and families.  The notion of the term ""curing"" autism can be controversial. From my perspective, our true goal is to establish a kind of personalized medicine, or precision health in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders, so that each autistic person is seen as the individual they are. We envision a world where individuals who are severely impacted by autism have the opportunity to get therapy and drugs that can help them — and those for whom a therapy is not warranted or who don't want it will have opportunities to live life the way they want to as well. Patient autonomy and societal accommodation are important aspects when considering these issues.   CNN: What causes autism?  Geschwind: Almost every medical condition has both genetic and environmental components. In autism, it seems that heritability is very high. The most recent large study suggested that heritable genetic factors — the things that you get from your parents that your parents have in their DNA — are probably somewhere around 80% or slightly higher.  That leaves 20% that's nonheritable, and of that we know that at least 10% of autism is caused by rare mutations that are not inherited. And that sounds like a paradox, but it's not. If you think about Down syndrome, that's a genetic mutation that the parents don't have in their DNA. That's called a new, or de novo, mutation.  You can calculate a risk score for having autism based on genetics, (but) right now, the risk score for autism is not that predictive because we haven't done enough research. For other conditions like cardiovascular or certain cancers, risk scores are very predictive because very large numbers of people have been studied.  Even so, this autism risk score is strongly correlated with high educational attainment, or a high IQ, which again speaks to the strengths associated with being autistic and highlights that we need to be more aware of the strengths that autistic individuals may have as well to optimize their opportunities to achieve their goals or contribute to society.  There also are several environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of autism. One of them is maternal exposure to valproate, which is an anti-epilepsy medication. There are several maternal viral infections that have been associated with autism. And two other things: the interbirth interval — how quickly after one birth a mother has another — and the age of the father. The thought on the last point is that as a man ages, their DNA repair mechanisms are maybe less active, and there are more frequent mutations in sperm.  A key point is that all these known environmental factors act prenatally, so in most cases the tendency towards being on the spectrum is something that individuals are born with.   CNN: To what extent has research debunked the controversial notion that vaccines can cause autism? Geschwind: The notion that vaccines cause autism has been entirely (disproved). There have been dozens of studies, using very different methodologies. There is absolutely no evidence that vaccines cause autism, and there's been much more harm than good done by purveyors of that fiction.   CNN: How do you treat autism?  Geschwind: It is imperative to have an early diagnosis, because we know that early identification and early intervention with behavioral therapies can be effective in up to 50% of kids. Some kids will respond so well that it's very hard to make a diagnosis of autism when they're 9 years old if the therapy is started early enough. The problem is that for many autistic individuals, current therapies are not that effective. There's a lot of work being done developing more effective cognitive behavioral therapies, figuring out which therapy is the best for which child. There's also work being done to develop medications that can be helpful to treat certain symptoms such as injurious behavior, repetitive behavior or difficulty with changes in routines.  My colleagues and I want to use treatment to augment and improve people's symptoms, not change who they are fundamentally. We believe strongly in every individual's autonomy. We also believe in personalized medicine so that it's not one-size-fits-all. There will be some patients in whom we're trying to correct a severe genetic mutation that has profound consequences, and there'll be others that need only a handful of accommodations, just like we provide for folks who need wheelchairs.   CNN: What will your research focus on next? Geschwind: There are two basic frontiers in my research. One recognizes that most of the work in neuropsychiatric disorders and autism has been done in primarily White European populations and focuses on a pressing need to be studying diverse populations. About seven or eight years ago, I started working with African American communities because certain aspects of genetics are population-specific, and we as researchers really need to understand that.   The frontier that is crosscutting across all of this is we need to be able to move from genetics in a population to genetics in an individual, so that by looking at somebody's genetic makeup, we can understand the mechanism of their autism. This is precision medicine.  My work is trying to understand how specific genetic variants, how specific mutations, impact brain development to eventually lead to the symptoms of autism. If my colleagues and I can understand that mechanism, just like we can understand the genetic mechanism in cancer, we can find a drug to target that and improve those symptoms over time.",0
399,'It just didn't enter my mind to initiate sex;' Low sex drive in men linked to chemical imbalance,"While hanging out with his college roommates, Peter (not his real name) realized he felt differently about sex than other heterosexual men. ""I've never been somebody who was interested in pornography, but I'd laugh along with their jokes,"" said Peter, now 44, who is British. ""Of course I never mentioned that ... as a man, you'd be kicked out of the herd."" As he developed ""proper, serious relationships"" with women, Peter discovered he didn't have the sexual drive many of his partners did. ""I would make excuses around getting tired or feeling stressed, that kind of thing,"" he said. ""It wasn't an issue with attraction to my partner. It just didn't enter my mind to initiate sex."" In 2021, Peter saw an ad recruiting male volunteers for a new study on hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Researchers planned to inject the study's participants with kisspeptin —a naturally occurring sexual hormone — to see if it increased their sex drive. Kisspeptin plays a key role in reproduction; without adequate levels of the hormone children do not go through puberty, for example. In a long-term, committed relationship with a woman he says has a higher sexual appetite, Peter signed up, intrigued by the thought that a biological imbalance might help explain his behavior. In the week after the final session, Peter said, something amazing occurred. ""All of a sudden, I wanted to initiate intimacy. I can only presume it was driven not by my mind remembering something, but my body wanting something,"" he said. ""I did initiate sex more and it improved things with my partner incredibly.""  Wiring in the brain Experts believe HSDD affects at least 10% of women and up to 8% of men, although those numbers may be low, said Stanley Althof, a professor emeritus of psychology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio and executive director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Health of South Florida. ""Men are embarrassed to go to the doctor to begin with, and you're supposed to be a macho guy,"" said Althof, who was not involved in the kisspeptin study.  ""So it's difficult for men to say, 'Hey, I've got a problem with my sex drive.' That's why the majority of male patients I see with HSDD are sent in by their partners.""   To be diagnosed with the disorder, a person must have no other issues that might cause a change in libido, such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.   ""Losing interest due to performance issues is common, but HSDD is its own thing,"" Althof said. ""It's an absence of erotic thoughts and a lack of desire for sex that has to be present for six months. It also cannot be better explained by another disorder or other stressors: It can't be due to depression. It can't be due to a bad relationship. It can't be due to taking an antidepressant."" One more key point: A man or woman must have clinically significant distress to have HSDD, said clinical psychologist Dr. Sheryl Kingsberg, a professor in reproductive biology and psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, who was also not involved in the kisspeptin study. ""Some people aren't bothered by their lack of interest in sex, so we wouldn't treat them for HSDD,"" said Kingsberg, who is also chief of behavioral medicine at MacDonald Women's Hospital and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. ""The women coming into my office are deeply distressed,"" she said. ""They tell me 'I used to have desire but it's gone. I could be on a desert island with no pressures, but I just don't have the appetite. I want it back.' Those women have HSDD."" 'Surreal' experience Dr. Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial College London, has been studying the relationship between low sexual desire and the hormone kisspeptin for years, first in animals, then in people. Prior studies by Dhillo of healthy men with no libido problems found giving them kisspeptin boosted levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, which is important for gonad function.  His newest study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open in February, enrolled 32 men with verified HSDD. Peter was one of them. ""So many people say to themselves, 'It's just me. I've got a problem.' But actually, HSDD may be how your brain is wired,"" said Dhillo, who is a dean at the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research Academy in Newcastle upon Tyne. ""The biology is telling us there's increased activation of inhibitory areas in the brain — the same areas that tell us it's not OK to walk around in public naked — and those areas are switching off sexual desire. How can we tackle that? We give a hormone that would naturally give you increased sexual desire, essentially hijacking the normal system."" The men participating in the new study visited Dhillo's lab twice. On each occasion, they were fitted with a device to objectively measure arousal, given an injection and asked to watch pornography while their brains were scanned via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neither the subjects or the researchers knew if that day's injection was kisspeptin or a placebo. ""It was extraordinarily surreal, lying there with something resembling a hangman's noose around your bits and watching a mixture of '70s to modern-day pornographic images and videos,"" Peter said. ""You'd get about five or six seconds of one type of image or video, rate your arousal for the researchers, and then move on to the next.""  Brain scans showed a significant dual effect after the kisspeptin injection, Dhillo said. Activity in the areas of the brain that inhibit behavior slowed, while areas of the brain connected to sexual interest lit up. ""As a group, the men had a 56% higher sexual response to sexual images after the kisspeptin than the placebo,"" Dhillo said. ""And we found no side effects at the very, very small dose that we are using.""  Peter noticed a difference immediately after finishing the treatments. His sex life was so robust, in fact, that it wasn't long before his partner was pregnant with their first child. As published, the study did not follow the men long-term to see if the effects of kisspeptin lasted. For Peter, however, its impact has been life-changing. ""I have found there's been a lasting effect for me,"" he said. ""I do find I have a much better sexual appetite even now some years after the treatment."" Even the arrival of a baby boy didn't deter his new interest in sex. ""The cliche is when you have kids, your sex life takes a bit of a hit,"" he told CNN. ""But that hasn't been the case for us. In fact, we're pregnant with our second child, due in July."" More research is needed While Peter had a positive long-term result, it's too soon to say kisspeptin injections were the reason, Althof said.  ""When you hear dramatic results like Peter's, I would be cautious in saying that is the typical outcome. While it's wonderful that it happened for him, these fMRI studies are difficult to interpret and not conclusive,"" he said. ""Sexual desire is very complicated — I say it's a combination of brain function, hormones and love, wine and roses,"" Althof added. ""This study is promising, but it needs replication in larger groups."" And even if future research does confirm kisspeptin's benefits, medical treatment is not a substitution for healthy communication about sex between partners and with health care providers, Dhillo said.  ""These are society's taboos, but actually, the more we talk about real (sexual) issues that affect real people, the more we find it's actually quite common,"" he said.""If you're not troubled by low libido, it's not an issue at all, but if you are troubled by it, this can lead to marital breakdown, unhappiness and reduced quality of life.""",0
400,"This California city's newest police recruit, ""Officer Hops,"" is a therapy bunny","Police dogs are nothing new — but a bunny in uniform is something that sound more like a character in an animated children's movie than real-life recruit. Not anymore. ""We would like to introduce Wellness Officer Percy,"" wrote police department in Yuba City, California in a recent Facebook post, sharing a picture of a brown and white bunny rabbit in a tiny K9 police harness. ""Officer Percy lounges at the police department during the day and is a support animal for all."" Also known as ""Officer Hops,"" Percy is a part of the department's recent focus on promoting mental health support for their staff. He serves as an outlet for stress when he is in the office, and as a friendly face when he is out visiting in the community. ""Our wellness program promotes the importance of prioritizing mental and physical health, providing tools and resources to reduce stress and create a positive foundation for well-being,"" said the department in their Facebook post. Percy was found by Ashley Carson, a member of the police department, in the middle of a road last October. Carson took the rabbit to animal control once realizing he was domesticated, but he was never claimed, according to the department.  Newly-named after the road he was found on — Percy Avenue — the bunny was adopted by another staff member soon after. Therapy bunny Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular in recent years, with several studies reporting evidence of their health benefits, including the decrease of anxiety and depression in their owners.  A 2020 study found that petting an animal can boost cognitive and emotional brain activity, for example, while a 2022 study found that just 10 minutes with a therapy dog reduced pain in emergency room patients. ""Recognition of our mutually beneficial relationship with domesticated animals, and in particular companion animals, is ever evolving,"" said Colleen Dell, a sociology professor at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, via email. Dell has for years researched the relationships between humans and animals.  ""When our team first started researching the impact of therapy dogs visiting with university students ten years ago, there was somewhat limited recognition of their potentially important role in human's lives,"" Dell said. ""Today, therapy dogs are on many campuses across North America, and in spaces you would never have thought you would see (them), like a hospital emergency department."" It's important to keep in mind a support animal's feelings too, Dell noted, as any human-animal relationship can be complicated. Picking up on body language is important to monitor their wellness — in the case of Percy, purring can signal a happy bunny, whereas pushed-back ears likely mean the opposite. Percy's new position could also help bring attention to the wider welfare of his species, which is often neglected, according to Dell.  ""Bunnies are adored in North America for being cute, friendly and cuddly,"" Dell said. ""In face of what officers and others in the station may face in their jobs, this can serve as a nice counterbalance."" ""This is an excellent way to establish rapport with the community,"" she added. ""There is a strong message here to build upon, of respecting others, including animals.""",0
401,"There were 32,000 fewer legal abortions in the US in the six months after the Dobbs decision, new analysis suggests","In the six months after the Supreme Court ruling that ended the federal right to an abortion, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions than expected in the United States, according to a new analysis.  There were about 5,000 fewer legal abortions each month, on average, than there were in the months before the ruling -- a drop of about 6%. In April and May, there were an average of about 82,000 abortions each month, according to the analysis. From July through December, that fell to an average of 77,000 abortions per month. The total number of abortions fluctuated month-to-month, but was always lower than it was in April.  The Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit focused on abortion and contraception, sponsored a research effort that collected data from abortion providers nationwide -- including clinics, private medical offices, hospitals and virtual clinics. More than 80% of known providers responded. Self-managed abortions that occur outside of the formal health care system were not included in the analysis. In the 13 states that enacted bans following the Supreme Court decision, abortions fell more than 95%, with just a few reported each month from July to December. But in the remaining set of states, the average number of abortions ticked up slightly. There were surges in some of those states, including Minnesota and Kansas, that suggest that individuals living in states with more restrictions may travel for care.  ""Those unable to overcome travel barriers are likely those with the fewest socioeconomic resources,"" the authors of the report wrote. ""Even small declines in the abortion rate still translate into enormous life impacts for those affected."" While the number of abortions declined overall, those provided virtually through telehealth increased each month and accounted for a growing share of abortions overall. There were more than 8,500 telehealth abortions in December, more than double compared with April.  Earlier research found that the average travel time to an abortion facility increased significantly for women in the US following the Supreme Court Decision. Dozens of clinics shuttered within the first month, and the average travel time to the closest facility more than tripled.",0
402,EPA proposes new regulations on toxic gas used to sterilize spices and medical equipment,"The US Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed a set of new restrictions on facilities that use the cancer-causing chemical ethylene oxide, a colorless, odorless gas that is used to sterilize medical devices and spices. The agency said the new rules, which have not been finalized, would help to reduce ethylene oxide gas that these facilities release by 80%, bringing emissions below a Clean Air Act standard for elevated cancer risk. Communities exposed to ethylene oxide gas have been pushing the EPA to put tighter controls on plants that use ethylene oxide gas. In 2018, an EPA report found that dozens of communities across the nation faced elevated cancer risks because of trace of amounts of ethylene oxide released into air as part of the sterilization process. The EPA issued the report on the new risks without issuing a news release, as it had done for the same report in years past. Some affected communities learned of the risk through a health assessment conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and media reports. A report from the EPA's Office of the Inspector General found that some communities weren't alerted to their risk by EPA at all. The elevated risk became apparent after a two-decade long review of the toxicity of ethylene oxide by scientists in EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. While the EPA acknowledged that ethylene oxide was more dangerous that had been previously understood, it continued to use an older set of rules to regulate facilities that released ethylene oxide as well as companies that manufacture it. The proposed rules aim to better align regulations on the producers and users of ethylene oxide with the cancer risk posed by the chemical. They follow a set of proposed rules issued by EPA last week that would put new controls on facilities that manufacture ethylene oxide. Taken together, the two sets of rules would remove 77 tons of ethylene oxide emissions a year, an 84% reduction compared with 2020 levels, EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. Environmental watchdog groups applauded the proposed restrictions, but noted that they don't go far enough to protect vulnerable communities, where residents are often low-income and disproportionately people of color. ""These regulations are long overdue, by almost a decade. I'm relieved and pleased that the EPA has finally issued proposed standards that are based on their own scientists' recommendations on an updated, higher cancer risk value. If enacted, these updated regulations would reduce emissions in fenceline communities,"" said Darya Minovi, a senior researcher scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""When the EPA issues the final rule, they should throw the net wider. The standard should cover a larger range of facilities to include off-site warehouses that often store recently sterilized equipment that continue to release ethylene oxide, but aren't regulated for their air emissions."" Minovi also said the EPA should require fenceline monitors -- devices that constantly read the air outside of facilities to make sure that toxic gas isn't drifting into neighborhoods. Jaime Rukstales, a member of the Illinois grassroots advocacy group Stop EtO in Lake County -- one of the communities impacted by ethylene oxide pollution -- says the EPA needs to impose tougher restrictions on ""all types of facilities that impact the health of our communities ... including sterilizers, manufacturers and warehouses near our homes, schools and businesses.""   Some off-site warehouses used to store newly sterilized products have registered high levels of ethylene oxide due to off-gassing of the products.   Meanwhile, chemical manufacturers sued the EPA in February over its updated hazard assessment for ethylene oxide. The industry wants the agency to use a less protective standard developed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. AdvaMed, a group that lobbies for the interests of medical device manufacturers, warned that more regulations could pose problems for patients. ""If new EPA regulations force sterilization facilities to close, patients could face treatment delays as sterile technology supplies, such as pacemakers and surgical equipment, fall short,"" Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of AdvaMed, said in a comment posted on the group's website. The EPA said some commercial sterilizers have already made the planned changes. ""Many sterilization and health care facilities are already taking the steps outlined in the proposal and have seen emissions drop significantly,"" McCabe said. Most facilities have taken action to control ethylene oxide blown out of sterilization chambers through exhaust vents known as ""back vents"" but only 25% to 33% of sterilizers are controlling so-called fugitive emissions, ethylene oxide that escapes or leaks into room air, said Jonathan Witt, an environmental engineer and technical lead on EPA's review of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. ""So we think it's a good sizable chunk of the industry, but still a little ways to go,"" Witt said on a call with reporters. If the rules go into effect, sterilizers would have 18 months to make the changes, which the EPA said is an accelerated time frame under the Clean Air Act. AdvaMed's Whitaker says that's not enough time. ""It could take many months for abatement equipment to arrive. Supply chains and manufacturing are still recovering from the pandemic,"" he noted in the statement. In issuing the proposed rules, the EPA said it aimed to strike a balance between lowing cancer risks for impacted communities and workers who use ethylene oxide while preserving ""critical sterilization capabilities."" The proposed rules would apply to 86 commercial sterilization facilities in the United States that use ethylene oxide gas to fumigate spices and medical devices.   The EPA says 20 billion medical devices -- mostly single-use, disposable items used in health care such as catheters, gloves and surgical gowns -- are sterilized using ethylene oxide. The US Food and Drug Administration is actively exploring alternatives to the use of the gas, the EPA said on Tuesday, but some devices still can't be sterilized any other way. In proposing the new rules, EPA said its new analysis found that exposure to ethylene oxide, or EtO, on the job significantly increased cancer risks for workers in sterilization facilities and those who apply ethylene oxide in health care facilities.   ""Now, a new EPA analysis shows that there may also be significant risks to workers who handle [ethylene oxide] and people who live, work or go to school near places where EtO is used in sterilization. And failing to take action to address these risks is simply unacceptable,"" EPA Administrator Janet McCabe said on a call with reporters. The additional lifetime cancer risk for a worker exposed to ethylene oxide for eight hours a day, 240 days a year for 35 years was between 1 in 10 and 1 in 36 for workers in sterilization facilities; and between 1 in 12 and 1 in 25 for workers exposed to ethylene oxide in health care facilities. To help lower those risks, the proposed rules require greater use of personal protective equipment for workers and new controls to decrease the amount of ethylene oxide in indoor air. Whitaker from AdvaMed, the medical device industry group, said the cancer risk for employees exposed to ethylene oxide on the job is overstated and disregards ""the strong employee protections already in practice."" Companies will also be required to use new real-time monitoring methods to confirm that these pollution controls are working inside facilities. These controls can measure ethylene oxide in indoor air down to 10 parts per billion.  If ethylene oxide levels climb above this threshold, everyone in the workplace would be required to wear protective equipment. They will also lower the amount of ethylene oxide that can be used for each sterilization cycle. The EPA is proposing to limit the application rate for ethylene oxide to no more than 500 milligrams per liter of air.   The rules would eliminate some niche uses of ethylene oxide where alternatives exist, including its use in museums, archival settings, beekeeping, some cosmetics, and in musical instruments. The EPA will take public comment on the new rules for 60 days. The agency will also host a virtual public webinar on May 1 to discuss its proposed rules and new risk assessment.",0
403,"Sexually transmitted infections jumped by 7% in 2021, according to the CDC","More than 2.5 million cases of sexually transmitted infections were reported in 2021, jumping by 7% in one year, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""The US STI epidemic shows no signs of slowing,"" said Dr. Leandro Mena, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention.  Chlamydia accounted for more than half of the reported cases, with rates increasing about 4% in 2021. Cases of gonorrhea rose nearly 5%. Cases of syphilis surged 32% in one year, including an alarming rise in infections passed from pregnant mothers to babies developing in the womb. In 2021, congenital syphilis caused 220 stillbirths and infant deaths.  ""The most important thing to remember is that congenital syphilis is 100% preventable,"" Mena said. ""In many ways, it is the result of our failure to prevent syphilis among women of reproductive age and their partners."" Lacking prenatal care and adequate maternal treatment are among the most common missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis, he said.  But a recent report found that it's become harder for women to access reproductive health care services — such as routine screenings and birth control — in recent years. Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access — and more of them — in 2021 than they were in 2017.  A combination of factors has contributed to the overall rise in STI cases, and the pandemic exacerbated many of them, Mena said.  ""The lack of access to health care, including testing and treatment for STI, can make it difficult for people to receive the care they need,"" Mena said. ""Decreased funding for public health and an eroding infrastructure in public health really have limited access to testing driven services."" Persistent stigma associated with STIs and lingering effects of pandemic-related disruptions challenge the scope of screening services. The number of reported STIs is likely a vast underrepresentation of a ""staggering"" number of actual cases, he says.   STIs affect every population, but the 2021 data from the CDC shows that case rates are disproportionately high among gay and bisexual men, younger people, and Black and American Indian people.   ""To make progress towards ending this STI epidemic, we must really meet people where they are by developing tailored and localized interventions to have the greatest impact,"" Mena said. ""We want to make sure that we're addressing the social and economic conditions that make it more difficult for some of these populations to stay healthy.""",0
404,Suspension of mifepristone approval wouldn't be the end of medication abortion,"Even if US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone goes through, there still will be a nonsurgical option for people to manage abortions at home.  In the United States, the so-called abortion pill is actually two medications, mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym, or known as RU-486, and misoprostol, which is taken about 24 to 48 hours later.  The federal judge's ruling in Texas last week applies only to mifepristone. He delayed his ruling for a week to allow for appeals, but even if the ruling is put in place, it does not involve misoprostol.  Misoprostol alone is considered a safe and effective way to have an abortion, studies show. It has been used that way for decades. The two drugs work differently. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus, and without it, the uterus will expel its contents. Misoprostol is approved by the FDA to prevent and treat gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It also is used off-label for other kinds of ulcers, and it has several gynecological uses, including to induce contractions, to decrease blood loss after delivery and to treat miscarriages.  When used for an abortion, misoprostol works to help empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions. ""It's a little old-school, but we could do it,"" said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in New Jersey and a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  It's what people did before the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, Brandi said. ""Many places around the country that don't have access to mifepristone, often due to politics, have been using misoprostol-only regimens for a long time,"" she said. California said Monday that it is stockpiling misoprostol. ""While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday's ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a release.  Some health organizations such as Carafem, a national provider of reproductive health services, offer the one drug alone. It is endorsed as a medically acceptable approach by the World Health Organization. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says a misoprostol-only regimen is an ""acceptable alternative"" if mifepristone is unavailable. Misoprostol is safe and effective The two-drug approach to medicine abortion is preferable because it is slightly more effective, Brandi said. Also, abortion with misoprostol alone can come with more side effects. A person who uses this method is instructed to use it sublingually, putting four pills under their tongue and leaving them there for 30 minutes, then swallowing what's left with water. They can also be used vaginally.  Typically, bleeding will begin within one to four hours after the first dose. Heavy bleeding usually lasts about three to five hours, but bleeding can last two weeks or longer, studies show.  Without mifepristone, a person most likely has to take more misoprostol than they would with the two-drug regimen. One study suggested that a person should be prescribed three or four doses as well as an additional dose in case it is needed. ""The more we give, the more side effects people will have. And that's not the goal. We want to make sure people not only have an effective response to the medicine, we also want to make sure that people aren't as uncomfortable as they could be,"" Brandi said. ""Like I tell my patients, you do not need to suffer to have an abortion. That is not the purpose of this process.""  Other side effects can include fever, chills, nausea and diarrhea.  Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all US abortions, studies show. Even if mifepristone is no longer available and misoprostol becomes the only option, it will still be the most popular choice, according to Dr. Jamila Perritt, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in Washington, D.C.  ""Again, it is safe. It is effective. It requires a different dosing, and you experience the symptoms a little bit longer,"" Perritt said. ""There are some other some additional side effects, like a longer duration of bleeding or more intense nausea or vomiting or gastrointestinal side effects, but when you look at that against the barriers that are put in place, both at the state and now the federal level for accessing abortion, many individuals still choose the second medication alone, because it is more convenient and easier, and it means you're not walking through hundreds of protesters when you go to get care at your health care provider's office."" Dr. Iffath A. Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says that although the one-drug option is safe, people shouldn't have to make that choice because a lot of research shows that the two drugs in combination are highly safe and effective. ""We do use off label medications when clinically appropriate; however, that should not happen here because we have over two decades worth of clinically sound evidence based information that this is valid option,"" Hoskins said.",0
405,"Gun violence has affected most families in the US, new survey finds","Worry and fear about gun violence are widespread in the United States, where most families have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation.   Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found.  The new report comes less than a day after a shooting that claimed at least four lives in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured.  About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels.  These tragic trends are part of a gun epidemic that has become deadlier than ever in the US. There were nearly 49,000 gun-related deaths in 2021, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- an unprecedented surge of about 23% over two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily.  Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to another recent KFF analysis. There are vast disparities in who's dying from guns, too. A recent study found that the homicide rate among young Black men was nearly 10 times higher than the overall firearm death rate in the US in 2021.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot.  The weight of that disparity is felt heavily in the Black community. One in 6 Black adults say that they don't feel at all safe in their neighborhoods, far higher than the share of White or Hispanic adults, according to the new KFF survey. About a third of both Black and Hispanic adults say they worry daily or almost daily that a family member will become a victim of gun violence, and about 1 in 5 say that gun-related crimes, injuries and deaths are a constant threat to their local community.  Still, prevention measures are lacking.  About three-quarters of adults who have a gun in their home say it is stored in a way that bucks common gun-safety practices, such as in an unlocked location or already loaded, the new survey found. And only 5% of adults say that a health care professional has talked to them about gun safety.  The latest KFF survey is based on responses from a representative sample of about 1,300 adults that were collected in mid-March.",0
406,"Almost 100 confirmed or probable cases of rare fungal infection linked to Michigan paper mill, health officials say","Ninety-three confirmed or probable cases of blastomycosis have been identified in Michigan's Delta and Menominee counties, according to the local health department, and they are believed to be associated with a paper mill in the town of Escanaba. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is predominantly found in the Midwest and the South, particularly around the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes. There are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, according to the CDC. One analysis found 1,216 deaths related to the illness from 1990 to 2010. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won't get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Other symptoms may include chest pain, trouble breathing, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and muscle or joint pain, according to Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties. In rare cases, the infection can spread outside the lungs to places like the skin, bones, brain and spinal cord. Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person. It's treated with antifungal medication that must be taken for a period ranging from six months to a year, depending on the severity of the illness and the person's overall health.   Nineteen of the cases linked with Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill have been confirmed by culture or microscope, and the other 74 are probable, meaning the person has symptoms of blastomycosis and a positive antigen or antibody test, the health department says. ""Although the source of the infection has not been established, we continue to take this matter very seriously and are following recommendations from health and government officials and implementing numerous, proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and visitors,"" Billerud Escanaba Mill Operations Vice President Brian Peterson said in a statement from the health department.",0
407,"Access to reproductive health care has become more challenging for women in the US, study shows","As abortion rights become more restricted in the United States, a new study shows that it's become harder for women to access reproductive health care services more broadly -- such as routine screenings and birth control -- in recent years. Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access -- and more of them -- in 2021 than they were in 2017, according to the study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open. Researchers analyzed survey data from thousands of women who were asked to reflect on their experiences with reproductive health care in the three years leading up to the study. About 45% of women experienced at least one barrier to reproductive health care services in 2021, up 10% from 2017. Nearly 19% reported at least three barriers in 2021, up from 16% in 2017.  ""Reproductive health care services are among the most common health care needs of women of reproductive age, and access to such care is of paramount public health importance,"" the researchers wrote. Delaying or forgoing it can have serious consequences, both to an individual's physical health and to their general well-being.  The most commonly cited barrier in both years was finding a physician or clinic that felt comfortable to the patient. About 1 in 4 women identified this as a challenge in 2021, up from about 1 in 5 in 2017.  Cost became slightly less of a barrier in that timeframe, but interpersonal relationships and logistical challenges such as finding transportation or child care became more challenging.  The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to these shifts, according to the researchers. Fear of contracting the virus could have heightened anxieties around visiting a health care setting, for example. The child care crisis has been exacerbated in recent years, which could limit travel flexibilities. On the other hand, stimulus checks may have helped ease some financial barriers.  Broader restrictions on reproductive rights -- including a significant cut in federally funded family planning clinics by the Trump administration -- probably also played a role, they wrote.  The largest increases in barriers to reproductive health care were reported by individuals from historically disadvantaged populations, including low-income and Hispanic women.  Access to reproductive health care is a ""persistent and pressing barrier,"" the researchers wrote. ""Significant"" challenges that existed in 2017 generally got worse in 2021.  ""The study's findings suggest that efforts are needed to ensure reproductive health care access, especially during disruptive events,"" they wrote.",0
408,Drugmakers sign letter supporting FDA and calling for reversal of Texas judge's mifepristone ruling,"Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and dozens of other biotech and pharmaceutical company leaders have signed an open letter in support of the US Food and Drug Administration's authority ""to approve and regulate safe, effective medicines for every American"" after Friday's decision by a Texas district court judge to halt the agency's approval of mifepristone, one of the medications used in abortion procedures.  US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said Friday that he will suspend the FDA's approval of mifepristone, the first of two drugs used in a medication abortion, after a weeklong stay to allow for appeals. On Monday, the US Department of Justice asked a federal appeals court to put a hold on the ruling. The letter called for a reversal of Kacsmaryk's decision, saying it ""set a precedent for diminishing FDA's authority over drug approvals, and in so doing, creates uncertainty for the entire biopharma industry."" ""As an industry we count on the FDA's autonomy and authority to bring new medicines to patients under a reliable regulatory process for drug evaluation and approval. Adding regulatory uncertainty to the already inherently risky work of discovering and developing new medicines will likely have the effect of reducing incentives for investment, endangering the innovation that characterizes our industry,"" the letter says. The letter also warns that if the judicial system ""can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone.""   In a separate statement, the biotech industry group BIO's interim president and CEO, Rachel King, emphasized the ""dangerous precedent"" the Texas judge's decision sets. ""The preliminary ruling by a federal judge in Texas is an assault on science and the FDA's long-standing role as the authority to make decisions on the safety and efficacy of medicines. For a court to invalidate the approval of a drug that was reviewed and approved more than two decades ago is without precedent. As legal scholars have noted, the courts do not have the medical expertise to make these types of scientific determinations,"" King said.",0
409,Many people don't know their blood type. Here's how to find out yours,"Is your blood type A, B, a combination of the two, or something else? You don't know, you say? Many people are in the same boat. In fact, only 62% of Americans reported knowing their blood type, according to a 2020 CBS News poll.  Those letters (and pluses and minuses) can be crucial information in an emergency, and there are simple but accurate ways to find out. Most blood types are only compatible with a handful of others, according to Dr. Dayand Borge, Divisional Chief Medical Officer at the American Red Cross.  Accidental incompatible blood transfusions, while rare, can be dangerous, Borge said. Luckily, there are easy ways to find out your blood type.  Ask your parents or doctor Before you go out of your way to try any of the other methods, check with your parents first. They may know or have old health records that include your blood type. You can also reach out to your health care provider, who may have that information on file. Blood draw Next time you go in to get your blood drawn, ask to know your blood type. If you've had blood drawn in the past, you can call the lab to see if they have the information. To request a blood test, visit your healthcare provider or a local health clinic. At-home blood test You can also purchase an at-home blood test online and have it shipped to your door. The kit comes with a needle and a testing card to drop your blood on. For many at-home tests, results take only minutes. Blood donation When you donate blood, the blood goes through multiple tests, including blood type. After you've donated with the Red Cross, you're given a blood donor card which will give you access to your blood type when they test it. This takes a few days and is free. If you've donated in the past, you may be able to check your blood type on their website. Saliva test For those squeamish of needles, a saliva test can help you determine your blood type without having to draw blood.  About 80% of people secrete the same antigens that are in their blood in their saliva, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research.  This means that the test is effective for most, but not everyone. These tests can be found online and cost more than traditional, at-home blood tests.",0
410,"Maternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road","In picturesque Bonner County, Idaho, Leandra Wright, 40, is pregnant with her seventh child.    Wright is due in August, but three weeks ago, the hospital where she had planned to deliver, Bonner General Health, announced that it would be suspending its labor and delivery services in May.    Now, she's facing a potentially precarious drive to another hospital 45 minutes from her home.    ""It's frustrating and worrisome,"" Wright said.   Wright has a history of fast labors. Her 15-year-old son, Noah, was born on the way to the hospital.  ""My fifth child was born on the side of the highway,"" Wright said. ""It was wintertime, and my hospital at the time in California was about 40 minutes away, and the roads were icy, so we didn't make it in time.""   By the time she and Noah got to the hospital, about 15 minutes after he was born, his body temperature was lower than normal.  ""It worries me not to have a doctor there and worries me to have to go through that,"" Wright said.  Residents of Bonner County aren't the only ones dealing with unexpected maternity unit closures.   Since 2011, 217 hospitals in the United States have closed their labor and delivery departments, according to a report by the health care consulting firm Chartis. A CNN tally shows that at least 13 such closures have been announced in the past year alone.   Closures nationwide Services provided at maternity units vary from hospital to hospital. Most  offer obstetrics care in which an obstetrician will deliver a baby, either vaginally or via cesarean section. These units also provide perinatal care, which is medical and supportive care before and after delivery.  Other services provided may include lactation specialists and private delivery rooms.  After May 19, Bonner General Health will no longer offer obstetrical services, meaning there will be zero obstetricians practicing there. Consequently, the hospital will no longer deliver babies. Additionally, the unit will no longer provide 24-hour anesthesia support or post-resuscitation or pre-transportation stabilization care for critically ill newborns.  Some hospitals that have recently closed their maternity units still offer perinatal care, along with routine gynecological care.  Bonner General is planning to establish a clinic where perinatal care will be offered. Gynecological services -- such as surgical services, preventative care, wellness exams and family planning -- will still be provided at a nearby women's health clinic.  The Chartis report says that the states with the highest loss of access to obstetrical care are Minnesota, Texas, Iowa, Kansas and Wisconsin, with each losing more than 10 facilities.  Data released last fall by the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes also shows that more than 2.2 million women of childbearing age across 1,119 US counties are living in ""maternity care deserts,"" meaning their counties have no hospitals offering obstetric care, no birth centers and no obstetric providers.   Maternity care deserts have been linked to a lack of adequate prenatal care or treatment for pregnancy complications and even an increased risk of maternal death for a year after giving birth.  Money is one reason why maternity units are being shuttered.   According to the American Hospital Association, 42% of births in the US are paid for by Medicaid, which has low reimbursement rates. Employer-sponsored insurance pays about $15,000 for a delivery, and Medicaid pays about $6,500, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care cost and utilization data.  ""Medicaid funds about half of all births nationally and more than half of births in rural areas,"" said Dr. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health researcher at the University of Minnesota who has conducted research on the growing number of maternity care deserts.  Kozhimannil says communities that are most likely to be affected by maternity unit closures tend to be remote towns in rural counties in states with ""less generous Medicaid programs.""  Hospitals in larger cities are often able to offset low reimbursement rates from Medicaid births with births covered by employer-sponsored insurance, according to Dr. Sina Haeri, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and CEO of Ouma Health, a company that provides virtual prenatal and perinatal care to mothers living in maternity care deserts.   Many large hospitals also have neonatal intensive care units.   ""If you have a NICU, that's a substantial revenue generator for a hospital,"" Haeri said.   Most rural hospitals do not have a NICU, only a nursery where they care for full-term, healthy babies, he said. Due to that financial burden, it does not make financial sense for many rural hospitals to keep labor and delivery units open.   A low volume of births is another reason for the closures.   In announcing the closure, Bonner General noted that in 2022, it delivered just 265 babies, which the hospital characterized as a significant decrease.   Rural hospital administrators providing obstetric care say it takes at least 200 births annually for a unit to remain safe and financially viable, according to a study led by Kozhimannil for the University of Minnesota's Rural Health Research Center.   Many administrators surveyed said they are working to keep units open despite low birth rates.   ""Of all the folks that we surveyed, about a third of them were still operating, even though they had fewer than 200 births a year,"" Kozhimannil said. ""We asked why, and they said, 'because our community needs it.' ""     Another issue for hospital administrators is staffing and recruitment.     The decision to close Bonner General's labor and delivery unit was also directly affected by a lack of experienced, qualified doctors and nurses in the state, said Erin Binnall, a Bonner General Health spokesperson.   ""After May 19th, Bonner General Health will no longer have reliable, consistent pediatric coverage to manage neonatal resuscitations and perinatal care. Bonner General's number one priority is patient safety. Not having board-certified providers certified in neonatal resuscitation willing to provide call and be present during deliveries makes it unsafe and unethical for BGH to provide these services,"" Binnall told CNN by email.   The American Hospital Association acknowledges the staffing challenges some hospitals face.    ""Simply put, if a hospital cannot recruit and retain the providers, nurses, and other appropriately trained caregivers to sustainably support a service then it cannot provide that care,"" the association said in a statement. ""Such challenges are only magnified in rural America, where workforce strain is compounded by aging demographics that in some communities has dramatically decreased demand for services like Labor and Delivery.""  More stringent abortion laws may be playing a role in the closures, too.   Bonner General said in a news release last month that due to Idaho's ""legal and political climate, highly respected, talented physicians are leaving. In addition, the Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care.""   According to the Guttmacher Institute, Idaho has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country: a complete ban that has only a few exceptions.   Idaho requires an ""affirmative defense,"" Guttmacher says, meaning a provider ""has to prove in court that an abortion met the criteria for a legal exception.""  No matter the reason, Kozhimannil said, closures in rural communities aren't just a nuisance. They also put families at risk.   ""That long drive isn't just an inconvenience. It actually is associated with health risks,"" she said. ""The consequence that we saw is an increase in preterm births. Preterm birth is the largest risk factor for infant mortality. It is a huge risk factor for developmental and cognitive delays for kids.""   Haeri says the decline in maternal care also has a clear effect on maternal mortality rates.   The maternal death rate for 2021 -- the year for which the most recent data is available -- was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in the US, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020, according to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics. In raw numbers, 1,205 women died of maternal causes in the US in 2021.   Conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes may raise a person's risk of complications, as can being pregnant with multiples, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pregnant women over the age of 35 are at a higher risk of pre-eclampsia.  Searching for solutions   As labor and delivery units continue to shut their doors, possible solutions to the growing problem are complex, Haeri says.   ""I think anyone that comes to you and says the current system is working is lying to you,"" he said. ""We all know that the current maternity system is not good.""    Kozhimannil's research has found that many women who live in maternity care deserts are members of minority communities.   ""When we conducted that research, we found the communities that were raising the alarm about this ... tended to be Black and indigenous, or tribal communities in rural places,"" she said. ""Black communities in the South and East and tribal communities throughout the country, but especially in the West, Mountain West and Midwest.""   Haeri says one possible solution is at a woman's fingertips.    ""I always say if a woman's got a cell phone, she should have access,"" he said.    A 2021 study found that women who live in remote areas of the US could benefit from telehealth visits, which would decrease the number of ""in-person prenatal care visits and increase access to care.""   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 12 to 14 prenatal care appointments for women with low-risk pregnancies, and the study suggests that expansion of prenatal telehealth appointments could help women living in remote areas better adhere to those guidelines.    Ouma works with mothers who are typically remote and high-risk, Haeri says.     He also believes that promoting midwifery and doula services would help bolster maternity care in the US.    Certified nurse midwives often assist remote mothers who are high-risk or who decide to give birth at home, he says.    Midwives not only deliver babies, they often work with medical equipment and can administer at-home physical exams, prescribe medications, order lab and diagnostic tests, and assess risk management, according to the American College of Nurse Midwives. Doulas -- who guide mothers through the birthing process -- are often present at home births and even hospital births.   ""That midwifery model shines when it comes to maternal care. [And] doula advocacy involvement leads to better outcomes and maternity care, and I think as a system,",0

412,"FDA warns of risk of overheating, fire with some FreeStyle Libre glucose monitors","At least seven fires and one injury that were related to some FreeStyle Libre glucose monitor products have led the US Food and Drug Administration to issue a Class I recall, the agency's strongest, which suggests that use of a device could cause ""serious injuries or death."" The manufacturer, Abbott, says there have been 206 incidents related to these monitors since 2014. But no users have died due to the problem, nor have there been any serious adverse health consequences.  The issue affects more than 4.2 million devices across the US, the FDA says. Abbott initiated a voluntary medical device correction in February on its FreeStyle Libre, FreeStyle Libre 14 day and FreeStyle Libre 2 Readers in the US because of reports from some users that the readers' lithium-ion batteries swelled, overheated and, in some cases, generated sparks or even caused a fire.  ""No FreeStyle Libre readers are being physically recalled and customers can continue to safely use their readers with the Abbott-provided USB cable and power adapter. Customers do not need to return their readers. The steps outlined at www.FreeStyleBattery.com provide guidance on how to properly store, charge and use a reader and its accompanying USB cable and power adapter,"" Abbott told CNN in an email Friday.  The company sent letters to some users of the FreeStyle Libre readers on February 13. People with diabetes use glucose monitors to check their blood sugar levels because of problems with how their body makes or uses insulin, a hormone that helps blood sugar enter cells, where it is used for energy. Without insulin, sugar can build up in the bloodstream and break down the body's own fat and muscle.   A continuous glucose monitor uses a handheld device that reads a sensor placed on the back of the person's upper arm to capture real-time glucose levels.  The monitor used with the FreeStyle Libre line uses lithium-ion batteries similar to those in a mobile phone. The battery is recharged with a yellow USB cable that Abbott provides with the equipment and which limits electric current to safely charge the battery. Use of other USB cables or power adapters, along with misuse of the equipment such as damage or exposure to liquids, may increase the risk of fire, the FDA's recall says.  The problem involves only the reader, not the sensor that the person wears on their arm. Unlike more common recalls in which customers are told to dispose of or return their items, this type of correction instructs users to continue using their devices but only with the equipment provided to recharge the device. The equipment should also be properly stored between temperatures of -4 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The reader should never be put in water, and the USB port should be kept clean. More information is available in the device's user guide. Users of these glucose monitoring devices also have the option to use an app on their phone to receive the glucose data, but this requires a new sensor, the FDA said. Customers who have questions or who want to learn about testing, storing charging or using their reader can visit www.FreeStyleBattery.com or contact Abbott customer service at 1-855-632-8658. Customers may also contact Abbott if they need a replacement power adapter or yellow USB cable.",0
413,"What is mifepristone, the drug at the heart of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit?","A federal judge in Texas has said he will suspend the approval of mifepristone, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades, although he is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal.  The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claims that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn't study it enough to approve it. Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.  Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it's sometimes known as RU 486. How mifepristone works Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.  This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.  How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country's most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone's safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.  Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra -- used to treat erectile dysfunction -- is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn't have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.  Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are ""exceedingly rare,"" happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations' amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US.  Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own.  The only use of misoprostol that's approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it ""off-label"" by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor.  Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a ""reasonable"" option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective.  This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization.  People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, said Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Massachusetts and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. ""Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,"" Wong said. ""Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.""",0
414,Gardening has taken off. Here's why the popular activity can replace your gym workout,"A lot of people find it difficult to embrace the idea of regular exercise, even though they know it's good for their physical and mental health. Yet committing to a workout routine doesn't necessarily entail going to the gym or running around your neighborhood. Gardening is a great example of a popular hobby that's accessible and can also be used as a workout.  Working in your garden or yard is a source of moderate to vigorous physical activity in younger adults, while providing low to moderate physical activity in older adults, research has shown. The pastime is also a muscle-strengthening activity, according to the US Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and one of the physical activities with the lowest injury rates. More good news: Puttering in your garden just two hours a week could help boost your mood, while the communal gardening that's proliferating in communities and schools provides social benefits that can alleviate stress and help combat isolation and even dementia, according to studies. With all these benefits, gardening for fitness will be a trend this year, predicts Rishi Mandal, San Francisco-based cofounder and CEO of the fitness coaching app Future. ""Our clients at Future have already been asking their coaches to add gardening and landscaping activities into their routines,"" Mandal said, ""because it's easy to access, fits into their lifestyle and offers meditative benefits."" This demand fits with the overall interest he's seeing among clients for less intensive fitness routines that are accessible and mesh with an on-the-go lifestyle. Why gardening is exercise Gardening engages all the major muscle groups, such as the arms, legs, shoulders, back and abdomen, Mandal said. The activity also improves mobility, helps build endurance, and is a comparable workout to walking or Pilates. All the necessary digging, planting, mowing, raking and weeding torches calories, too. A 154-pound person burns an average of 330 calories per hour through gardening, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such activity is similar to what that same person would burn playing golf or dancing.  Tom Adkinson of Nashville has long been on board with the notion of gardening to stay fit. The 72-year-old has three gardens, which he uses primarily to grow tomatoes, sweet banana peppers and okra. The work varies in intensity during the growing season. ""Every year I turn the soil by hand,"" Adkinson said, ""and I consider that serious exercise."" The hours Adkinson spends staking the tomatoes, then watering and weeding all three gardens, involves a lot of bending and stretching, which he likens to performing garden yoga.  Start with a warm-up Just as with traditional exercise, Adkinson warms up beforehand, doing various stretches. That's wise, said Christine Zellers, an assistant professor of family and community health sciences at Rutgers University. ""Even though gardening may not appear strenuous, using the body in new ways can make you stiff if you don't work up to the movement and prepare by limbering up a little,"" said Zellers, who teaches at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension of Cape May County in New Jersey. In addition to stretching, going for a short walk before you begin gardening can also serve as a warm-up. While working in your garden or yard, it's important to bend at the knees to lift heavy objects, she said, and pace yourself if you're new. Just as a new runner would slowly build up miles before tackling a marathon, new gardeners should start with short sessions, gradually increasing the time and intensity spent in their gardens. Build muscle strength and burn calories Once you've got some experience working in your garden or yard, you can ramp things up for more of a challenge. If you've purchased a flat of flowers, bring them to the backyard one at a time. When it's time to mow the lawn, increase the pace of your mowing or switch to a push mower. For some strength training, fill two large watering cans, then carry them around your yard to water the plants.  ""Gardening can provide a sense of accomplishment and reward, in addition to movement, by doing something with your hands that is fulfilling, like feeding your family or making your yard look wonderful,"" Zellers said. For Adkinson, one of the biggest benefits of gardening as exercise is the tangible reward he receives for his efforts. ""Getting fresh tomatoes and fresh okra well into the fall is way better than going to the gym,"" Adkinson said. ""There's really nothing better than your own sliced tomato for a sandwich.""",0
415,"Popular Easter candy Peeps contains additive linked to cancer, Consumer Reports says","Most convenient store shelves are well stocked with sugary marshmallow chicks and bunnies in time for Easter.  The original yellow-colored chick is still the best-selling product sold under the Peeps brand, but the popular springtime candy brand is being criticized for containing red dye No. 3 in its pink- and purple-colored candies. Consumer Reports called out several Peeps candies as containing the dye that it said is ""a known carcinogen,"" according to a Monday news release from the nonprofit.  Consumer Reports sent a letter on March 17 to Just Born Quality Confections, which makes the candy, asking for a response by the end of the month. Consumer Reports said the company did not announce ""any plans to change its manufacturing process."" In a statement to CNN via email, Just Born said, ""FD&C Red #3 is currently an approved colorant for use in candy by the (US Food and Drug Administration). We manufacture all our candies in compliance with FDA regulations, sourcing our ingredients and packaging exclusively from reputable suppliers who adhere to high quality and safety standards.""   The company noted that the ingredients are listed on packaging and websites.  Just Born added that its product development team is ""continually exploring opportunities to provide expanded options for our consumers, including colors derived from natural sources that can deliver the same visual impact and stability as their certified counterparts."" Consumer Reports has started a petition for the removal of the colorant in Peeps. ""The widespread use of Red Dye 3 is particularly concerning since it is found in many products marketed to children who are especially at risk of developing health problems from exposure,"" said Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist for Consumer Reports, in a statement. ""Just Born Quality Confections should stop making its iconic marshmallow treats with this dangerous food chemical since other less risky alternatives are readily available,"" Hansen added. This move is not the first push to ban red dye No. 3. In October, Consumer Reports joined more than 20 other organizations to urge the FDA to remove the color additive from its approved list of ingredients.  Recently, a California State Assembly bill was introduced that would ban the sale of food products containing red dye No. 3 and other food additives thought to be harmful by January 2025. The confectionery industry's trade group, of which Just Born is a member, said US companies follow government standards.  ""Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy, as they have been for centuries. Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we do not use any ingredients in our products that do not comply with the FDA's strictest safety standards,"" said Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president of public affairs and communications at the National Confectioners Association, via email.  ""Chocolate and candy companies will continue to innovate as new information becomes available and consumer preferences change,"" Gindlesperger added. What is known about red dye No. 3 Nearly 3,000 food products contain the red colorant, according to the Food Scores database created by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization. Red dye No. 3 is approved for use in food and oral drug forms but has been banned in cosmetics since 1990 due to a carcinogenic response in rats. A 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment found that the consumption of red dye No. 3 can cause hyperactivity and other behavioral difficulties in children, concluding that some may be more sensitive than others. And a study published in 2012 suggested that the common food dye can cause cancer in animals, although there is no evidence that it is the same case for humans. While the yellow Peeps do not contain the red dye, concerned consumers should check food labels of other candies when putting together this year's Easter baskets. Any food products containing red dye No. 3 will have the additive listed as FD&C Red #3, as required by the FDA.",0
416,5 easy steps to get healthier,"Wouldn't it be nice if there were some undiscovered ingredient, and one bite of it would cure all our health concerns? There isn't one, sadly.  But scientists do know the recipe to better health, and it is a long-term practice of good habits when it comes to sleep, eating, exercise, socialization and stress.  In honor of the 75th anniversary of the World Health Organization, here are the factors that add up to better health and what you can do today to improve in these areas.   Ask your doctor if you have specific concerns in any of these areas.   Get enough sleep A bad night's rest doesn't just mess with your concentration during the day. So far this year, CNN has reported that not getting enough sleep can increase your risk of mood problems, asthma, stroke and longevity.  Sleep is kind of a big deal. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults get at least seven hours of sleep a night — but quality is important as well. To get more good sleep, research shows it's important to set a schedule for going to bed and waking up, follow a nighttime routine to tell your brain it's time to go to bed, keep your bedroom dark and cool, turn away from the screens early, and don't lay in bed if you are having trouble sleeping.  Eat good food People's individual bodies need different things, but is there a best way to guide your nutrition? According to many scientific studies and U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings, it's the Mediterranean diet.  Don't let the word diet fool you — this isn't a restrictive philosophy to manipulate your body weight. The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating that features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions. Numerous studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. Get some exercise  Scientists have long known that exercise is good for a healthy body, but research has shown it's also important for a healthy mind.  The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that people between the ages of 18 and 64 engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity each week, as well as muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week. The good news is even if you can't get there right now, adding even a little bit will help.  Research published earlier this year showed that even 11 minutes of exercise a day can lower your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease or premature death. Take time to socialize Many people place a lot of importance on some of the health behaviors often thought of as more physical, but social and emotional factors deserve our attention as well.  And good, strong friendships are key to not just alleviating our stress and improving emotional well-being, but also boosting markers of our physical health, according to the latest research.  People should grow this area of health by investing more in a feeling of community, experts have suggested. They also stressed the importance of making friendship a priority in your schedule: Text a friend that you haven't talked to in a long time, commit to meeting one new person a month, host a dinner party or join a class. Strong bonds won't happen overnight, but starting small and prioritizing friendships as an important part of your life can bring more happiness, less stress and more support, workplace belonging expert Adam Smiley Poswolsky told CNN earlier this year.  ""Even when — especially when — their friend is struggling or going through something hard,"" said Poswolsky who is also author of ""Friendship in the Age of Loneliness: An Optimist's Guide to Connection."" ""You know someone is a true friend when they have your back when you're sick, when you lose your job, when you make a mistake, when you're going through a break-up, when you're stressed, when you're sad."" Reduce your stress  I know I've heard it every time I go to the doctor for any concern: Whatever it is, it gets worse with stress.  Sure enough, stress can send a body into fight or fligh, which raises cortisol. Higher levels of cortisol can exacerbate health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic gastrointestinal problems, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  Stress can also cause or contribute to anxiety, irritability, poor sleep, substance abuse, chronic distrust or worry, and more. Fortunately, a balanced diet, good sleep, exercise and social support can help with stress reduction. It can also help to explore breathing and meditation techniques. You may be thinking, I am already stretched thin in my day — adding in all these health behaviors will cause stress by itself.  The good news is that these habits are best added with small, manageable changes over a period of time.  Approach your goals one bite at a time and with a plan, flexibility, fun and support, and you may soon find you've made the changes you are looking for, said Katy Milkman, the James G. Dinan Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, author of ""How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be.""

417,CDC warns doctors to watch for Marburg virus amid outbreaks in two African nations,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory Thursday about the Marburg virus outbreak in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania.  Marburg is a rare but highly fatal viral fever that causes uncontrolled bleeding, similar to Ebola. The CDC's warning says that although there are no cases in the United States and the current risk is low, health care providers should be on the lookout for any imported cases.  Providers who suspect that someone is sick with Marburg virus should take a detailed travel history, the CDC said. The patient should be managed under isolation until there is a negative test, and the local health department should be contacted immediately.  Marburg virus is not contagious until symptoms appear. These can include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms and unexplained bleeding.  It can spread through contact with an infected person's blood and other body fluids or through fluids from infected animals. It does not spread through the air like the virus that causes Covid-19.  There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the disease. Early intensive supportive care, the CDC said, may keep people from getting seriously ill or dying.  In March, the CDC warned travelers to Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania to avoid contact with sick people and to monitor their health for three weeks after visiting those countries. The agency posted notices in international airports reminding people to watch for symptoms and to see a doctor immediately if they feel sick. It's also sending text messages to travelers who have been in those countries.  The CDC has sent staff to Africa to help fight the outbreaks, which are the first reported in either Equatorial Guinea or Tanzania. Authorities were made aware of the outbreak in Equatorial Guinea in early February. On February 7, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for Equatorial Guinea announced that there had been a cluster of deaths in early January.  In late March, the Ministry of Health of Tanzania announced an outbreak in the northwest part of the country. As of April 5, there have been eight lab-confirmed cases, and five of those people have died. The CDC said there is no evidence to suggest that the two outbreaks are related. Most experts agree that these cases represent two independent animal-to-human spillover events.  In addition to avoiding areas where there are known outbreaks, there are ways to keep yourself safe from Marburg virus, the CDC said. Avoid contact with blood and bodily fluids from people who are sick. If attending a funeral for someone who has died from the disease, take care not to touch the body. Also avoid contact with fruit bats and primates in areas where there are outbreaks, since both animals are known to be carriers for the virus.",0
418,"Eating too much 'free sugar' has 45 negative health effects, study finds","There are at least 45 good reasons to cut back on added sugar, according to a new study.  Copious research has shown the negative effects of excessive sugar intake on health, which has informed recommendations to limit consumption of ""free"" or added sugar to less than 10% of a person's daily caloric intake.  Still, researchers in China and the United States felt that before developing detailed policies for sugar restriction, the ""quality of existing evidence needs to be comprehensively evaluated,"" according to the study published Wednesday in the journal The BMJ.  In a large review of 73 meta-analyses — which included 8,601 studies — high consumption of added sugar was associated with significantly higher risks of 45 negative health outcomes, including diabetes, gout, obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, cancer, asthma, tooth decay, depression and early death. Free sugars — the type of sugar the authors focused on — are those added during the processing of foods; packaged as table sugar and other sweeteners; and naturally occurring in syrups, honey, fruit juice, vegetable juice, purees, pastes and similar products in which the cellular structure of the food has been broken down, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This category does not include sugars naturally occurring in dairy or structurally whole fruits and vegetables.  The study ""provides a useful overview of the current state of the science on sugar consumption and our health ... and confirms that eating too much sugar is likely to cause problems,"" said Dr. Maya Adam, director of Health Media Innovation and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. Adam wasn't involved in the study.   ""Studies like this are helpful in advising patients that seemingly small changes, such as cutting out excess sugar like sugar-sweetened beverages, can have a marked and positive improvement to health,"" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, who wasn't involved in the study. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that participants with the highest consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages had higher body weight than those with the lowest intake.  ""As a nutrition researcher who served on both the 2010 and 2020 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees, I can confirm that intake of dietary sugar in the US is more than twice the recommended amount (less than 10% of total daily caloric intake) and while the direct impact of sugar itself offers minimal, if any, nutritional benefits, it further replaces foods that do,"" said Linda Van Horn, professor emeritus of preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, via email. Van Horn wasn't involved in the study.  The connection between sugar and disease Evidence of a link between free sugar and cancer has been limited and controversial, and needs more research, the study's authors said. But the finding, according to the study, could be explained by the known effects of sugar on weight: High sugar consumption has been associated with obesity, which is a strong risk factor for various cancers. The same goes for cardiovascular disease. ""Added sugar intake can promote inflammation in the body, and this can cause stress on the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to increased blood pressure,"" behavioral scientist Brooke Aggarwal told CNN in February. Aggarwal, an assistant professor of medical sciences in the cardiology division at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, wasn't involved in the study.  Highly processed foods, which can have lots of free sugar, have been found to increase inflammation, a risk factor for depression.  ""Whole food carbohydrates take longer to break down into simple sugars, and a part of them — the fiber — can't be broken down at all,"" Adam told CNN in February. ""This means that whole, intact grains don't cause the same spikes in blood sugar that we experience when we eat simple sugars. Blood sugar spikes trigger insulin spikes, which can destabilize our blood glucose and ... be the underlying cause of health problems in the long run.""  Reducing your intake  The findings — in combination with existing guidance from the World Health Organization, World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research — suggest people should limit free sugar intake to less than 25 grams, or about 6 teaspoons, per day. There's that much sugar in 2 ½ chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch and about 1 ½ tablespoons of honey. A doughnut has around 15 to 30 grams of sugar, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  The authors also recommend reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to less than one serving (about 200 to 355 milliliters) per week. That's the equivalent of an up to 12-ounce soda, Aggarwal said via email.    To change sugar consumption patterns, the authors think ""a combination of widespread public health education and policies worldwide is urgently needed.""  But there are some changes you can begin making on your own.  Be aware of what you're putting in your body by reading nutrition labels when shopping — even the ones on foods you might not think of as sweet, such as bread, breakfast cereals, yogurts or condiments. These foods usually have lots of added sugar, and it adds up, Adam said.  Opt for water sweetened with fruit slices instead of sugary drinks and have fresh or frozen fruit for dessert instead of cakes, cookies or ice cream. Cooking and baking at home more often is one of the best ways to reduce sugar intake, Aggarwal said.  Getting enough good-quality sleep on a regular basis would also help ""as we tend to choose foods higher in sugar when we're tired,"" Aggarwal said. Cutting back gradually can help you train your taste buds to crave less sugar.  ""Our lives will probably end up being sweeter with less sugar in our diets,"" Adam said.",0
419,Biden administration finalizes rule to target 'misleading' Medicare Advantage ads,"US health officials have issued a final rule that not only makes some changes to Medicare -- including expanding access to behavioral health care and clarifying criteria guidelines -- it cracks down on ""misleading"" advertisements.  On Wednesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services, through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, finalized the rule that, among other things, prohibits advertisements that do not mention a specific plan name and use Medicare logos or language in a way that could mislead and confuse enrollees into believing that the ads come from the government. The measures are the latest in the Biden administration's efforts to rein in Medicare Advantage plans, which have been soaring in popularity. About half of Medicare participants are enrolled in these plans, which are run by insurers that contract with the federal government.  According to CMS, the ""proliferation of certain television advertisements"" promoting enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans -- which are offered by Medicare-approved private companies -- has been concerning.    ""Today, we're announcing a rule that will crack down on misleading marketing schemes by the health insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage plans, those that offer Part D prescription drug plans and their downstream entities. Among other provisions, the rule would prohibit overly general ads about the Medicare Advantage program that often tends to confuse and mislead those individuals who are eligible to apply for some of these insurance plans,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said Wednesday.  In general, about 65 million Americans are within the Medicare program, according to Becerra. ""Any marketing that does not specifically name a health plan, that misrepresents what a plan might offer within these commercials, is something that would now be prohibited,"" he said. ""That's going to be important because the confusion that often arises, and the changes that some enrollees often will make to their detriment in getting health care, are things that we want to try to avoid."" Last year, the Senate Finance Committee released a report highlighting an increase in such deceptive marketing practices that target seniors with Medicare Advantage plans and recommending that CMS take action to reduce the prevalence of such marketing tactics.   ""We've heard from many seniors and people with disabilities about misleading and confusing advertising for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. Today's final rule includes changes to protect people exploring Medicare Advantage and Part D coverage from confusing and potentially misleading marketing practices,"" Dr. Meena Seshamani, CMS deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicare, said Wednesday. ""We are finalizing 21 marketing provisions to protect beneficiaries."" Beyond marketing requirements, the final rule clarifies criteria guidelines to help ensure that people with Medicare Advantage receive access to the same ""medically necessary"" care they would receive with traditional Medicare.  The rule also expands the list of populations to which Medicare Advantage organizations must provide ""culturally competent"" services, such as people with limited English proficiency or those in the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the rule requires that a prior authorization approval for care remain valid for as long as ""medically necessary"" to avoid disruptions in care for beneficiaries. ""We are also finalizing new minimum wait time standards for behavioral health,"" Seshamani said, as well as requiring that most types of Medicare Advantage plans include behavioral health services. The American Hospital Association said in a statement Wednesday that it applauds the increased attention on Advantage plans. ""Hospitals and health systems have raised the alarm that beneficiaries enrolled in some Medicare Advantage plans are routinely experiencing inappropriate delays and denials for coverage of medically necessary care,"" said Ashley Thompson, the group's senior vice president for public policy analysis and development. ""This rule will go a long way in protecting patients and ensuring timely access to care, as well as reducing inappropriate administrative burden on an already strained health care workforce."" Protecting and strengthening Medicare is one of the administration's top priorities, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a news release Wednesday. ""With this final rule, CMS is putting in place new safeguards that make it easier for people with Medicare to access the benefits and services they are entitled to, while also strengthening the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs."" On Friday, CMS issued controversial final payment policies for 2024 that seek to limit overbilling by Medicare Advantage plans. The changes include updating the risk adjustment model to better ensure that payments are in line with patients' medical conditions and that insurers don't add diagnoses to inflate their billing.  Insurers protested the proposed rule vehemently, leading CMS to phase in the changes over three years, instead of one.",0
420,"Sleep problems linked to fivefold rise in stroke risk, study says","Snoring, snorting, tossing and turning, napping for a long time during the day, waking up during the night, and sleeping too little or even too much all contribute to poor-quality sleep and may raise your risk for stroke, according to a new study. In fact, researchers found the more sleep problems you have, the greater the risk of stroke. ""Having more than five of these symptoms may lead to five times the risk of stroke compared to those who do not have any sleep problems,"" said study author Christine McCarthy of the University of Galway in Ireland in a statement.  ""The findings are consistent with prior research linking unhealthy sleep to high blood pressure and to impairments to blood vessels, which are risk factors for stroke,"" said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the study. One reason may be the impact of short, fragmented sleep and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea on the body's ability to regulate metabolism, blood pressure and inflammation, which are all risk factors for stroke, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern's medical school, who was not involved in the study.  ""Poor sleep can impair the natural blood pressure dipping that occurs during night time sleep and contribute to hypertension — an important risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease,"" Zee said via email. ""In other population based research, similar relationships have been reported between poor sleep health and disorders such as diabetes, heart disease and dementia."" Sleep problems and stroke risk The study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, analyzed data from more than 4,500 people participating in INTERSTROKE, a large international case-control study of patients who have experienced a stroke.  Nearly 1,800 participants in the study had an ischemic stroke, the most common kind, in which a blood clot blocks an artery leading to the brain. Another 439 people had an intracerebral hemorrhage in which arteries or veins in the brain rupture, causing bleeding into brain tissue. Participants in the study were then matched by age and sex to people who had no history of stroke. Both groups answered questions about their sleep quality and behavior, and the two groups were compared. Results showed people who slept less than five hours a night on average were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who got seven hours of sleep — the recommended minimum for adults.  On the flip side, sleeping more than nine hours a night on average was associated with a twofold increase in stroke risk, according to a statement on the study. The results held true even after adjustments to eliminate other issues that can lead to stroke, including depression, alcohol abuse, smoking and a lack of physical activity, according to the study. Having sleep apnea — a condition in which people stop breathing multiple times per hour — was associated with a threefold increase in stroke risk, the statement said.  ""Sleep apnea can alter the pathways involved in the regulation of coagulation factors that can increase the risk of strokes,"" Zee said. Snoring or snorting, which can both be signs of untreated sleep apnea, were also risky. People who snored were 91% more likely to have suffered a stroke, while those who snorted were almost three times as likely to have had a stroke than those who did not.  Napping was also a risk factor, the statement said. People who on average napped more than an hour were 88% more likely to suffer a stroke than those who did not. However, taking a planned nap of less than an hour was not associated with an increased stroke risk, the study said. It's important to note that the research could only show an association between sleep problems and stroke, not causation, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""The question remains: Is poor quality sleep causative? Or is it simply associated with a cluster of bad health habits that would lead somebody to have a higher stroke risk?"" asked Freeman, who was not involved in the research. ""Are they under a lot of stress? Are they drinking huge amounts of caffeine and then not sleeping?  Maybe they're not exercising very much, and we know that exercise promotes good quality sleep,"" Freeman said. ""It's hard to tease out all the factors that might contribute."" What to do Practicing good sleep hygiene, eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise are all key ways to reduce the negative impact of sleep disorders and reduce stroke and cardiovascular risk, Freeman said. ""What I always tell people is, you know, getting about seven hours a night of uninterrupted sleep is associated with the least amount of cardiovascular disease,"" he said. It's important to prioritize getting those seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night on a regular basis, Zee said. Doing so means going to bed and waking at the same time every day, even on weekends. ""Regular exposure to light in the morning and afternoon can also improve sleep quality,"" she said, adding that anyone suffering from snoring, insomnia or excessive sleepiness during the day should talk to a sleep specialist. The bedroom should be used for sleeping and intimacy only, Freeman added.  ""Don't hang out in there and watch TV or read books or do work in there,"" he said. ""Keep a notebook next to the bed so if you wake up in the middle of the night you can write down what comes to mind. Diffuse any worries you have by meditating on it and do your best to let things go."" Don't drink alcohol or eat at least three hours before bed to avoid gastric distress that might wake you up, Zee suggested.  ""It's also important to exercise, preferably in the morning,"" Freeman added. ""The one true medicine that works always is improving one's lifestyle to include healthy behaviors.""",0
421,How to tell when stress is a problem Our medical expert explains,"As we mark Stress Awareness Month in April, I know there's so much to be stressed out—mass shootings, wars around the world, the pandemic's long-term effects and the daily stresses of living and working in the 21st century. I'm sure you've got your list. Everyone experiences stress at different points in their life. But when is stress a problem that requires our attention? What symptoms should people be on the lookout for? What are the health impacts of long-term stress? What are healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms? And what techniques can help in addressing—and preventing—stress? Fresh from dropping off my kid at school late (sorry, kid, my fault), I was looking forward to this advice from CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore's Health Commissioner and as Chair of Behavioral Health Systems Baltimore.   CNN: Let's start with the basics. What exactly is stress? Dr. Leana Wen: There is no single definition of stress. The World Health Organization's definition refers to a state of worry or tension caused by a difficult situation. Many people experience stress as mental or emotional strain. Others also have physical manifestations of stress. Stress is a natural reaction. It's a human response that prompts us to respond to challenges and perceived threats. Some stress can be healthy and can prompt us to fulfill obligations. Perceived stress can spur us to study for a test or complete a project by a certain deadline. Virtually everyone experiences that kind of stress to some extent.   CNN: Why can stress be a problem? Wen: The same human response that motivates us to work hard and finish a project can also lead to other emotions, like not being able to relax and becoming irritable and anxious. Some people develop physical reactions, like headaches, upset stomach and trouble sleeping. Longer-term stress can lead to anxiety and depression, and it can worsen symptoms for people with pre-existing behavioral health conditions, including substance use.   CNN: What are symptoms of stress that people should be on the lookout for?  Wen: In addition to feeling irritable and anxious, people experiencing stress can also feel nervous, uncertain and angry. They often express other symptoms, including feeling a lack of motivation; having trouble concentrating; and being tired, overwhelmed and burnt out. Many times, people in stressful situations will report being sad or depressed.   It's important to note that depression and anxiety are separate medical diagnoses. Someone with depression and/or anxiety could have their symptoms exacerbated when they are undergoing times in their life with added stress. Long-term stress can also lead to depression and anxiety.   One way to think about the difference between stress versus anxiety and depression is that stress is generally a response to an external issue. The external cause could be good and motivating, like the need to finish a project. It could also be a negative emotional stress, like an argument with a romantic partner, concerns about financial stability or a challenging situation at work. Stress should go away when the situation is resolved.   Anxiety and depression, on the other hand, are generally persistent. Even after a stressful external event has passed, these internal feelings of apprehension, unworthiness and sadness are still there and interfere with your ability to live and enjoy your life.   CNN: What are the health impacts of long-term stress? Wen: Chronic stress can have long-term consequences. Studies have shown that it can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke. It's associated with worse immune response and decreased cognitive function.   Individuals experiencing stress are also more likely to endorse unhealthy behaviors, like smoking, excessive drinking, substance use, lack of sleep and physical inactivity. These lifestyle factors in turn can lead to worse health outcomes.   CNN: What techniques can help in addressing stress? Wen: First, awareness is important. Know your own body and your reaction to stress. Sometimes, anticipating that a situation may be stressful and being prepared to deal with it can reduce stress and anxiety.   Second, identifying symptoms can help. For example, if you know that your stress reaction includes feeling your heart rate increase and getting agitated, then you can detect the symptoms as they occur and become aware of the stressful situation as it's occurring. Third, know what stress relief techniques work for you. Some people are big fans of mindfulness meditation. Those, and deep breathing exercises, are good for everyone to try.   For me, nothing beats stress relief like exercise. For me, what helps is exercising, in particular swimming. Aerobic exercise is associated with stress relief, and mixing it up with high-intensity regimens can help, too.   A lot of people have other specific techniques that help them. Some people clean their house, organize their closets or work in their gardens. Others spend time walking in nature, writing in a journal, knitting, playing with their pets or cycling.   I'd advise that you experiment with what works, take stock of existing techniques that help you and incorporate some of those practices into your regular routine. Then, in times of stress, they are good tools to turn to that you know will help you.    CNN: What unhealthy copings strategies should people avoid? Wen: Definitely. There are things people turn to in an effort to make themselves feel better in the short-term that can actually make things worse. Excessive alcohol intake, using drugs and smoking aren't healthy coping strategies. It's the same with staying up all night, binge-eating and taking out your frustration on loved ones. These have wide-ranging consequences, and you should reconsider them if they have been your go-to coping mechanisms in the past.   CNN: When is it time to seek help? Wen: If the stress you are feeling is consistently interfering with your work, social or personal life or if you are experiencing signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, it's time to seek help. Consider speaking with your primary care physician to get a referral to a therapist. Your workplace may have an Employee Assistance Program that you can turn to, too. And the federal mental health crisis hotline number, 988, is another resource.  This April, for Stress Awareness Month, I hope we can all assess our own stress levels as well as our reaction to stress. We should recognize what helps us to reduce and alleviate stress as we aim to improve our physical and emotional well-being.",0
422,FDA inspection finds sterilization issues at recalled eye drop manufacturer's facility,"The manufacturer of eye drops that have been linked to an outbreak of serious bacterial infections in the US, including at least three deaths, did not follow proper protocol to prevent contamination of its products, according to an inspection report published Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA visited a Global Pharma Healthcare facility in India for an inspection that started in mid-February, 2½ weeks after the company recalled EzriCare Artificial Tears due to possible contamination.  At the time of the recall, there were 55 reports of adverse events including eye infections, permanent loss of vision and at least one death with a bloodstream infection. As of late last month, 68 infections had been identified in 16 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been three deaths, eight cases of vision loss and four surgical eye removals reported. An 11-day inspection of the Global Pharma facility resulted in 11 observations by the FDA, including a ""manufacturing process that lacked assurance of product sterility,"" specifically for batches of product that were manufactured between December 2020 and April 2022 and shipped to the US. The EzriCare Artificial Tears product, which is manufactured by Global Pharma, is part of an outbreak of infections from bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa.   This rare drug-resistant bacteria can spread among people who don't have symptoms -- and to people who haven't used the eye drops, according to the CDC. This type of spread is particularly common in health care settings.  ""The bacteria can spread when one patient carrying the bacteria exposes another patient, or when patients touch common items or when healthcare workers transmit the germs which is why infection control, like hand hygiene, is so important,"" the agency told CNN in an email Monday. Several cases in the current outbreak have been identified in people who were carrying the bacteria without signs or symptoms of clinical infections, the CDC said. These cases were discovered through screenings at inpatient health care facilities that had clusters of infections. The particular strain of the bacteria associated with this outbreak had never before been reported in the US, and related infections have been identified at acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, emergency departments, urgent care clinics and other outpatient facilities. People affected by the outbreak reported using different brands of artificial tears, but EzriCare Artificial Tears was most commonly reported. The FDA inspection of the Global Pharma facility is part of an ongoing compliance matter. ""The FDA's highest priority is protecting public health -- this includes working with manufacturers to quickly remove unsafe drugs from shelves when they are identified,"" the agency said in an email Monday. ""The FDA continues to monitor this issue and is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the companies recalling these affected products. We urge consumers to stop using these products which may be harmful to their health.""",0

424,"Study finds slightly higher risk of autism diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed","A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two. About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists still don't know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too. Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition. Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It's used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.  A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems. The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation. As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure. The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe. Experts say it's important to note that the research can't show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis. Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. ""Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,"" Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection. The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide. ""If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,"" wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. ""Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies -- which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water -- do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder. ""It's an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,"" said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. ""We have to see if there's a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD."" Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder. A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it's just the populations who live in more polluted areas. ""There's a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?"" Wiznitzer said. ""We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that's high on our list.""",0
425,How to make your community livable for you now and in the years ahead,"There is something exciting about a walk with my dog down my street — even though everything we see and do along the way is entirely predictable. I know we will wave hello to my retired neighbor tending his garden. We will pass teens at the basketball courts and younger kids on the playground. I know members of the church congregation are going to have their Saturday cookout. I know my dog Milo will start pulling when he sees the grocer at the end of the street and realizes a treat is coming any minute.  Predictable as they are, these environments and interactions that make up my neighborhood help make my community livable.  A livable community is one that is set up so that residents of any age can thrive, said Mike Watson, the director of livable communities at AARP. That way, a family can build a life with young children and then continue to feel invested in their community after retirement.  But those types of communities are not accessible to everyone everywhere, he added.  That is why the nonprofit Trust for America's Health and the AARP are working with communities all over the United States. The goal is to make them more ""safe and accessible and equitable to all racial ethnic groups and backgrounds,"" said Karon Phillips, policy development manager at the trust. Previous research has shown that social connections and community are key to a long life span and good health outcomes, while lack of social connections and unhappiness can reduce life expectancy. A livable community might be an important piece of living longer and better lives, Watson said.  What makes a livable community What makes a place livable depends on the needs of that particular neighborhood, but there are some common factors.  The four basic pillars of health are nutrition, physical activity, sleep and behavior (meaning stress, coping, connection and support), according to Johns Hopkins Children's Hospital. And many of the things needed in a livable community support those pillars. It's important that communities have various methods of transportation, Watson said. Safe roads are important, but so are navigable sidewalks and public transportation for residents who don't drive. Similarly, various forms of affordable housing help keep people living in the communities they love. In addition to single family homes, apartments and accessory dwelling units (an additional apartment or small home on the same lot as a single-family home) provide options for people with constraints or who need access to care from their loved ones, Phillips said.  Ways to access nutritious food and quality health care easily — with or without a car — also ensures that people can live well in their community, she added. And another critical factor is how effectively a place promotes social connection, Phillips said. Are there parks that various generations can frequent? Are there community centers or libraries? Are faith communities available? Are there systems or a culture in place so that people check up on one another?  Many resources are primarily available online, so high-speed internet broadband is also a resource that makes a neighborhood more accessible, Watson said. Though there may be retirement communities that aim to provide those needs to older residents, not everyone wants to leave their community when their needs change, he said.   ""What I've heard from my patients and what we see in terms of people's outcomes, the more that you can be integrated in the community where you live and work the better for your mood,"" said Dr. Mirnova Ceïde, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York.  ""People who are isolated or put into a different community, they can get really depressed,"" she added. How everyone benefits Whatever stage of life you are in, investing in a community that works for everyone is always a good idea, Phillips said.  If all goes well, today's 20-year-old will one day become a 60-year-old, so planning for a neighborhood that works long into the future benefits everyone, Watson said. ""Millennials are a larger generation and so are projected to live longer lives,"" he added. ""This country is aging."" But younger generations don't have to wait long to see the investment pay off, Watson said.  The same parks and libraries that bring social connection to older adults are also important resources for kids and young families, he said. A safe sidewalk and crosswalks are important for people using wheelchairs, people on crutches and families with strollers, too. And everyone has a lot to gain from living with multiple generations, whether that is learning about iPads or the roots of a community, said Dr. Joyce Balls-Berry, an associate professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""There's so much wealth that can be learned from our elders,"" Balls-Berry said. ""And there's even things that our seniors are learning from the generations that would be considered their grandchildren and great grandchildren."" How to make it happen Because many of the things that make communities livable rely on the built environment — such as parks, housing and grocery availability — much of the progress is going to have to come from local governments and organizations, Phillips said. ""Look at who needs to partner,"" Phillips said. ""There has to be a champion at the table that's going to push for this."" But that doesn't mean there is nothing you as an individual can do to invest in making your community more livable today, Watson said. In addition to pressing local government to make the changes you care about, you can do what other volunteer groups have had success doing: going around their neighborhoods and documenting parts that may be unsafe or inaccessible, he added. Pictures of cracks in sidewalks or curbs that might not be clear to someone with vision impairment can motivate lawmakers to distribute funding at levels that meet the community's needs, Watson said.  And the relationships you build in your community can make strides toward it being more livable, Ceïde said.  You don't have to assume your older neighbors are unable to do things on their own and just offer them your help. Ask your neighbors about themselves and their stories to form real connections, Ceïde added.  ""People like being able to engage with somebody at a human level, and letting them know that they are meaningful and they have something to provide can make a big difference in the quality of life of people,"" she said.",0
426,WHO advisers to consider whether obesity medication should be added to Essential Medicines List,"Advisers to the World Health Organization will consider next month whether to add liraglutide, the active ingredient in certain diabetes and obesity medications, to its list of essential medicines. The list, which is updated every two years, includes medicines ""that satisfy the priority health needs of the population,"" WHO says. ""They are intended to be available within the context of function health systems at all times, in adequate amounts in the appropriate dosage forms, of assured quality and at prices that individuals and the community can afford.""   The list is ""a guide for the development and updating of national and institutional essential medicine lists to support the procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector, medicines reimbursement schemes, medicine donations, and local medicine production."" The WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines is scheduled to meet April 24-28 to discuss revisions and updates involving dozens of medications. The request to add GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide came from four researchers at US institutions including Yale University and Brigham and Women's Hospital. These drugs mimic the effects of an appetite-regulating hormone, GLP-1, and stimulate the release of insulin. This helps lower blood sugar and slows the passage of food through the gut. Liraglutide was developed to treat diabetes but approved in the US as a weight-loss treatment in 2014; its more potent cousin, semaglutide, has been approved for diabetes since 2017 and as an obesity treatment in 2021. The latter use has become well-known thanks to promotions from celebrities and on social media. It's sold under the name Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.  Studies suggest that semaglutide may help people lose an average of 10% to 15% of their starting weight -- significantly more than with other medications. But because of this high demand, some versions of the medication have been in shortage in the US since the middle of last year.  The US patent on liraglutide is set to expire this year, and drugmaker Novo Nordisk says generic versions could be available in June 2024. The company has not been involved in the application to WHO, it said in a statement, but ""we welcome the WHO review and look forward to the readout and decision."" ""At present, there are no medications included in the [Essential Medicines List] that specifically target weight loss for the global burden of obesity,"" the researchers wrote in their request to WHO. ""At this time, the EML includes mineral supplements for nutritional deficiencies yet it is also described that most of the population live in 'countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.' "" WHO's advisers will make recommendations on which drugs should be included in this year's list, expected to come in September. ""This particular drug has a certain history, but the use of it probably has not been long enough to be able to see it on the Essential Medicines List,"" Dr. Francesco Blanca, WHO director for nutrition and food safety, said at a briefing Wednesday. ""There's also issues related to the cost of the treatment. At the same time, WHO is looking at the use of drugs to reduce weight excess in the context of a systematic review for guidelines for children and adolescents. So we believe that it is a work in progress, but we'll see what the Essential Medicines List committee is going to conclude.""",0
427,"Prescriptions for ADHD treatments surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC report shows","Prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults, a new study found. The finding comes as one common ADHD treatment, Adderall, has been in shortage for months, in part because of high demand. Diagnoses for ADHD have become more common in recent decades, and prescriptions for stimulant drugs that are most often used to treat the neurodevelopmental disorder have also been on the rise. But the new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights a recent surge in demand for the drug and others like it. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. Overall, the CDC analysis of private insurance records shows that more than 4% of people ages 5 to 64 had filled a prescription for a stimulant in 2021, up from 3.8% in 2020. The vast majority of people who are prescribed stimulant medications have an ADHD diagnosis or are being treated for symptoms of the disorder.   ADHD is typically identified in childhood and has been more prevalent among boys, and the CDC analysis found that stimulant prescriptions were consistently most common among boys ages 5 to 19.  However, the largest annual increases in 2021 were among adults, especially women in their 20s and 30s. There are well-established clinical guidelines for ADHD care for children and adolescents, with an outline of symptoms that show a persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity. While there is growing recognition of ADHD in adults, a comparable playbook for adults does not exist. The gap in guidance for adults is a public health concern in part because of the ""general inadequate access to mental health providers trained to diagnose and manage ADHD,"" according to the researchers. ""Development of clinical recommendations for diagnosing and managing adult ADHD could help guide safe and appropriate stimulant prescribing,"" they wrote. While stimulants can offer ""substantial benefits"" for people with ADHD, there are also potential harms including misuse and overdose. Nearly 33,000 people died from an overdose involving a psychostimulant in 2021, CDC data shows. Methamphetamine is primary drug involved, but deaths have nearly doubled since 2019. The sharp rise in prescriptions for stimulants during the pandemic also raises questions about the role of telehealth. Expanded access to telehealth during the pandemic could have removed barriers and encouraged more people to seek care, especially during a time when mental health struggles were exacerbated.  But it also could have introduced greater potential for inadequate evaluations or inappropriate stimulant prescribing, according to the researchers. ""Evaluation of policies enacted during the pandemic could identify benefits and harms of those policies,"" they wrote. Some people who use stimulants for ADHD have struggled for months to fill their prescriptions.  The US Food and Drug Administration announced a shortage of Adderall on October 12, 2022. The agency noted that it was in communication with all manufacturers of amphetamine mixed salts and that one of those companies was ""experiencing ongoing intermittent manufacturing delays."" Although other manufacturers continued to produce the drug, the agency said, ""there is not sufficient supply to continue to meet U.S. market demand through those producers."" Jim McKinney, a spokesperson for the agency, told CNN last month that the manufacturing delay has been resolved and that the shortage is now ""demand-driven."" On its website, the FDA lists eight manufacturers that have reported Adderall shortages to the agency. The website lists the shortage reason for some versions of the drug, such as ""demand increase"" or ""shortage of active ingredient,"" but for other versions, it just says ""other"" or lists no reason at all.",0
428,Sleep apnea and snoring: 8 warning signs to look for,"Obstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time.  Snoring can be a key sign of obstructive sleep apnea — but at some point in our lives, we all snore.  A cold or allergy can block nasal passages, a few drinks too close to bed will automatically relax tongue, palate and throat muscles — and before we know it, we're unconsciously forcing air past soft tissues, causing vibrations that escape as a snore. ""Snoring can be normal and not something to worry about,"" said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School.  ""When it's loud, raucous snoring, or it's interrupted by pauses in breathing, that's where we start to get concerned."" It's estimated that at least 25 million American adults and 936 million adults between the ages of 30 and 69 worldwide may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, with many more people undiagnosed. Sleep apnea can be dangerous The condition is called ""obstructive"" sleep apnea because unlike central sleep apnea — in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe — obstructive sleep apnea is due to a blockage of the airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues. ""You're making the effort with your belly and your chest to try to get the air in and out, but because of the obstruction in the upper airway, you can't. Often you aren't aware of this struggle, but it can be very, very scary for anyone watching,"" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. If left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea puts you at high risk for hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or depression, and even an early death, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. How can you tell when your snoring has become dangerous to your health? Sleep experts use a sleep questionnaire with an easy-to-follow acronym: STOP BANG.  Is snoring bad? Snoring is a key indicator, so it's a no-duh that it leads the list of potential warnings signs. But this is no quiet gentle snore, and certainly not a snore that anyone could ever call ""cute.""  ""We're talking loud, obnoxious snoring, the type that would drown out conversations or be heard through closed doors,"" Dasgupta said. ""Some of the very descriptive bed partners of my patients with obstructive sleep apnea describe their partners' snores as listening to a 'dying bear' or a scene from 'Jurassic Park.'"" How tired are you?  Being really tired during the day is a prime indicator of poor sleep, Robbins said. Combined with snoring, it can be a telltale symptom of sleep apnea.  ""Falling asleep anytime you have a moment — sitting down for a break after lunch, in a movie theater — those are all hallmark symptoms along with fatigue and taking the house down with your snores,"" said Robbins, who coauthored the book, ""Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But Are Too Tired to Ask."" Partners often observe apnea Many people — if not most — have no idea that they snore at night. Nor do they know they stop breathing during the night, unless the blockage is so bad that they wake up gasping and choking.  ""The O stands for observed apnea, and that's actually worse than just snoring,"" Dasgupta said. ""An apnea means no flow of air — no air coming in no air going out. You're not breathing. Observed apnea is really a red flag."" Bed partners are often key to the identification of obstructive sleep apnea. ""Watching your partner stop breathing, snore, cough or gasp for air are all signs the snoring might not be normal, and then it is something that deserves attention from a sleep specialist,"" Robbins said. Sleep apnea and high blood pressure Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to hypertension. Every time a person stops breathing for a few seconds, the body's sympathetic nervous system goes into action and raises blood pressure. In addition, the body releases stress hormones called catecholamines, which can also raise blood pressure over time.  While having hypertension by itself is not a sign of a sleep disorder, it can be a warning sign when combined with other telltale signals. Fortunately, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea, like continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, have not only been shown to help with sleep apnea — they also lower blood pressure. Weight and sleep apnea What's your body mass index? That's a score commonly used to indicate levels of weight. To measure BMI, health professionals use height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. Your weight is considered normal if your BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9. You are deemed overweight when your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 — and a BMI of 30 or more indicates you are obese. People who are obese or extremely obese (with a BMI of 35 and above) are frequently found to have obstructive sleep apnea because the extra weight in the mouth, tongue and neck collapses those soft tissues, making it more difficult to easily breathe without snoring. ""Weight loss can be a big part of the recommendation from a health care provider for addressing sleep apnea,"" Robbins said.  Obstructive sleep apnea has been on the rise around the world as obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but it wasn't seen as frequently before the 1970s, she added.  Age, gender, neck circumstance are predictors Muscle tone weakens as we age, including in our soft palate and neck. So being older than age 50 is another potential signal that your snoring may be or could turn into obstructive sleep apnea.  There is some good news: Studies are beginning to find that sleep apnea in the elderly tends to be of a mild to moderate kind, with the more severe cases occurring at younger ages. Having a large neck circumference, either from being overweight or genetics, is also a key indicator of potential obstructive sleep apnea.  ""Now you don't want to be a weirdo and start measuring your loved one's neck build at night,"" Dasgupta said. ""The rule of thumb is always going to be a collar size of greater than 17 inches (43 centimeters) for a male, and greater than 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) for a female will put you at a higher risk for sleep apnea."" Are you a man? Then unfortunately, that, too, makes you at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Some of the reasons may be that men tend to have fatter tongues and carry more fat in their upper bodies than women, especially in the neck. Men also tend to have more ""belly fat,"" which can make breathing in general more difficult. ""However, we definitely see a lot more obstructive sleep apnea in women after menopause,"" Dasgupta said. Are you at high risk for sleep apnea? Now it's time to score your risk.  Give yourself a point for every ""yes"" answer to these questions: Do you snore? Are you tired during the day? Does your partner witness you snoring? Do you have high blood pressure? Are you overweight? Are you older? Do you have a larger neck circumference? Are you a man?   If you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.  ""Sleep tests nowadays are much, much easier to get than in prior years when you could only go to a sleep lab,"" Dasgupta said. ""You don't have to be stuck in the lab with all these wires on you, looking like Frankenstein. You can do an at-home sleep test in your own bed, which is nice."" But don't ignore your symptoms, as the negative effects on health should not be ignored, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: ""Like a fire alarm, snoring is a warning of danger that demands your attention."" If your score is between 0 and 2, your risk is obviously low, so snoring isn't likely to be a big concern for your health. A score of 3 to 4 puts you at an intermediate risk, but that doesn't mean you should ignore your symptoms, especially if you share your bed with a loved one, Dasgupta said. ""It's always good to be a nice person, and if it affects your bed partner, I think it's worthwhile getting evaluated,"" he said. ""If your bed partner is wakened multiple times during the night by your snoring or can't fall asleep because of your snores, then that bed partner is going to be sleep deprived, and that is not good for their health. So it's not always about yourself."" How to treat sleep apnea? The treatment of choice for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. By pushing air into the lungs through a nose mask, the device helps keep the airway unobstructed throughout the night.  Weight loss can significantly decrease — or even eliminate obstructive sleep apnea, as the loss of tissue mass in the mouth, tongue and neck eases pressure on the airway. Doctors can also prescribe an oral appliance designed to enlarge the airway by moving the tongue or jaw forward. If anatomical issues, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or a deviated septum, are contributing to the apnea, surgery may be recommended.  Mild cases of sleep apnea may respond to ""positional therapy,"" a fancy way of saying keeping sleepers on their sides instead of back during sleep, which can improve airway flow and reduce snoring.  ""I'm a big fan of simple, homemade solutions, such as sewing tennis balls into the back of pajamas to keep people from turning onto their backs,"" Dasgupta said. ""You can get even more creative by putting a bra on someone in reverse and then putting tennis balls in in the cups,"" Robbins suggested.",0
429,A new procedure offers hope to 'no option' patients facing amputation because of severe circulation problems,"Cynthia Elford loves to travel and hike, but a few years ago, her Type 1 diabetes made getting around nearly impossible. By 2018, the Pennsylvania grandmother faced the possibility of losing her right leg because of a diabetes-related circulation problem, and she developed sores on her toes that kept getting worse.  She pleaded with her doctor to try to save her right leg. She had already lost the left leg to the same circulation problems. ""I told him I didn't think that I'd be able to make it if I lost my other leg,"" said Elford, 63. ""I was too active of a person."" Dr. Mehdi H. Shishehbor, president of University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute in Cleveland, told her that she might be in luck.  People with extreme circulatory problems like Elford have typically been considered ""no-option"" patients, destined to lose their foot or leg. But University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute had joined a clinical trial that might be able to help her.  Elford didn't hesitate to say yes to the trial, even when Shishehbor warned her that it would involve a lot of pain, at least at first.  Elford became the first person in Ohio to undergo the new procedure, called LimFlow.  Shishehbor has been perfecting LimFlow for the past five years or so, he said. He helped test it in a small number of people to make sure the technique was feasible and safe. Doctors then expanded the research to a multicenter trial with 105 participants. The results were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. LimFlow is a minimally invasive technique that can help people with the extreme form of peripheral artery disease called chronic limb-threatening ischemia, or CLTI. With peripheral artery disease or PAD, a fatty sticky substance called plaque accumulates on the inner surface of the arteries that lead to the legs. This causes the blood vessels to narrow and reduces circulation to the legs and feet.  Without an adequate supply of blood to the area, wounds and ulcers are slow to heal or won't heal at all, and that can damage tissue. Infection can spread to the bones. A lack of bloodflow can also result in gangrene.  CLTI carries a high mortality rate: About 25% of people don't survive one year after diagnosis, studies show. For some, blockages can be cleared through a surgical procedure, and circulation can be restored. But in 20% to 30% of cases, that standard care doesn't work, Shishehbor said. The blockages cannot be cleared, and amputation has been the only option. With the LimFlow procedure, doctors take an artery ahead of the blockage and connect it to an unblocked vein in the lower leg using a stent graft, a small kind of mesh tube, reversing the flow in that vein to send blood to the foot.  It's an outpatient procedure done under the same kind of sedation that doctors use for a colonoscopy, so there's no general anesthesia. It's all done with needles, one in the groin and another in the foot, and catheterization, the use of a flexible tube, Shishehbor said.  The procedure was performed successfully in all but one of the 105 study participants. The study was designed with a median participant age of 70. More than 30% of the participants were female, and 43% were Black, Hispanic or Latino. Diversity was key, the study authors said, because people of color with PAD are disproportionately at risk of amputation compared with White patients, studies show. Six months after the procedure, 76% of the participants had still been able to keep their leg; 76% had completely healed, or their wounds were healing.  ""It's been incredible,"" Shishehbor said. When he started with the trial, he thought that preventing amputation in even 20% of patients would be successful. ""I'd be happy, because the alternative would be 100% amputation. So the fact that we were able to, in 76% of the time, save the limb of the patients that had no options, it made me very proud and very happy and excited. ""We feel that we are going to give hope to so many patients,"" Shishebor added. Dr. Christopher Abularrage, a vascular surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the patient population targeted in the study had previously had no option but amputation.  ""This new technique provides vascular surgeons and also other interventionalists further options to decrease major amputations and improve amputation-free survival,"" said Abularrage, who was not involved in the new research. The minimally invasive aspect of the procedure is also an advantage, he said, because this group often has multiple other health conditions.  ""It's minimally invasive in this sick population versus what could be a three-, four-hour open surgery with large wounds, blood loss, cardiac risk,"" Abularrage said. ""I think that this is going to expand the use of this technique for years to come for those people who, unfortunately, don't have options for a bypass."" Dr. Michael Conte, a vascular surgeon at UCSF, takes a more cautious tack because there was no control group in the trial, and he doesn't feel that it was completely clear that it worked.  ""Half the patients at the end of the study still had open wounds. Fifty percent to 60% still needed other procedures. The story was far from over when the study ended for most of these patients,"" said Conte, who was not involved in the study.  He's also concerned that because it's an innovative procedure, some providers may choose it instead of a more reliable conventional approach, even for people who have other options like surgery. But for people without alternatives, he said, it could be an option. ""I think the vascular community needs to interpret this with some excitement, but cautious excitement,"" Conte said.  The trial data has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, Shishehbor said, and the researchers hope to hear by May whether LimFlow will be approved. A lot of people stand to benefit if it's approved. In the US alone, about 160,000 people are diagnosed with this ""no-option"" form of the circulatory disease every year, one study showed.  And the number will probably grow as the number of people with diabetes -- a known risk factor -- continues to rise. About 6.5 million people 40 and older in the United States have PAD, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and being older than 60 are also risk factors. Lower limb amputations are 10 times more likely in people who have diabetes than those who don't, according to the World Health Organization.  For Elford, the procedure offered an immediate sense of hope.  ""I was way groggy and out of it, but I remember they all stood around clapping when the procedure was over,"" she said. There was intense pain, at least at first, she said. Shishehbor said it takes about four to six weeks for the body to find its equilibrium and restart the process of healing. ""It was horrible pain, and I can see why a lot of people might give up,"" Elford said. ""Eventually, the pain started lessening, and it was getting better, and it was just amazing how then I have no pain in my leg whatsoever, and it's very strong."" Shishehbor said some of his patients are five or six years past the procedure and are still are doing well. One of them is Elford, who said she is eternally grateful to her doctor. ""I'm walking. I go shopping. I drive,"" Elford said. ""Yeah, he's my miracle.""",0
430,Doctor explains new over-the-counter medicine that's a 'complete antidote to opioids',"With drug overdose deaths continuing to hover near record levels, the US Food and Drug Administration approved for the first time an over-the-counter version of the opioid overdose antidote Narcan. Dr. Leana Wen explains.",0
431,What you need to know about the Marburg virus,"The West African country of Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of the Marburg virus disease in mid-February. There have been at least nine laboratory-confirmed cases, seven of which resulted in death, and 20 probable cases of dead individuals in this outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. Now, authorities in Tanzania, in East Africa, have confirmed that country's first-ever case of the fatal disease. Health officials are investigating a total of eight cases, five of whom have died, and they have identified a total of 161 contacts who are being monitored. As most people know now from the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a virus can spread from one country to another and hop from continent to continent through human transmission. In terms of infection, we are one community, which is why I turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen to ask about the Marburg virus. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health I asked about the disease's symptoms, what makes it so dangerous, how it is spread, whether there is a vaccine, and how the disease is treated. Finally, who should worry about the Marburg virus? CNN: What is the Marburg virus disease?  Dr. Leana Wen: The Marburg virus disease is caused by the Marburg virus, which is in the same family of viruses as the Ebola virus. Like Ebola, Marburg causes a severe hemorrhagic fever that impacts multiple organ systems and can include profuse bleeding, and affects both humans and nonhuman primates. The viral infection is a zoonotic disease, meaning that the origin of the disease is transmission from animals to humans. With previous outbreaks, fruit bats have been identified as the hosts of the Marburg virus, from which the virus is then transmitted to people. CNN: What are symptoms and what makes this disease so dangerous? Wen: Marburg virus disease is extremely deadly and is highly contagious when engaging in direct contact with an infected person. With previous outbreaks, case fatality rates have ranged from 24% to 88%, with an average fatality rate of around 50%. That means about half the people who contract the disease will die from it. Symptoms often start suddenly, with infected patients experiencing high fever, headache, muscle aches and malaise. It's also common to have abdominal pain and cramping and heavy watery diarrhea.  This disease, like Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever, in which infected individuals bleed from multiple orifices. Externally, patients might bleed from the nose, gums and eyes, and internal bleeding manifests as blood in vomit, urine and stool. Severe blood loss can cause shock and death. The incubation period — the period from infection to the start of symptoms — is as short as two days to as long as three weeks. Most symptoms start within a week, with death occurring between eight and nine days after initial symptoms. CNN: How is the Marburg virus spread? Wen: Similar to Ebola, Marburg is spread via direct person-to-person contact. That includes contact with blood or other bodily fluids or objects contaminated with the bodily fluids of an infected person — such as bedding, clothing, needles and other medical equipment. Some cases have also been documented in which semen from a man who has recovered from Marburg has resulted in transmission to his partners.  Those most at risk of Marburg are people in direct contact with infected individuals. That includes family members, caregivers and health care workers. Individuals with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should be placed in isolation. Those caring for them should wear protective gowns, gloves and masks to prevent direct physical contact with the patient. CNN: Is there a vaccine? How is Marburg virus disease treated? Wen: No vaccine has been developed against the Marburg virus, though there is an experimental vaccine and other vaccine candidates. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Infected patients are treated with symptomatic and supportive therapies, meaning that they would get fluids, oxygen and blood transfusions as necessary. CNN: Who should worry about the Marburg virus? Wen: At this time, cases of the Marburg virus disease have been found in just the two countries, Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania. Efforts are underway to contain these outbreaks. Successful containment has occurred in the past. Marburg is not a new disease — it was detected in 1967 after simultaneous outbreaks in Germany and Serbia. Numerous outbreaks have occurred since, including in Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and most recently, in 2022, in Ghana.  Though the Marburg virus causes severe disease, there are ways to contain it. Individuals transmitting it to others are generally symptomatic. In addition, the Marburg virus is not an airborne virus. That makes it easier to control compared with Covid-19, which is often transmitted by people who are not exhibiting symptoms and is so contagious that it does not require direct contact and can be carried on microscopic aerosols.  The two Marburg outbreaks in West and East Africa must be monitored closely. Health care workers in these regions should be on high alert, and efforts to test a vaccine and treatments should be expedited. At this time, there is no need for most of the world to worry about the danger of Marburg infection. However, the Marburg virus is yet another reminder of the many zoonotic pathogens that are capable of causing severe harm to human health.",0
432,Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else,"Guns are the leading cause of death for US children and teens, since surpassing car accidents in 2020.  Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. Nearly 3,600 children died in gun-related incidents that year. That's about five children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis. The shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville on Monday, marks the 16th shooting this year in grades K-12 and the deadliest since the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year, according to a CNN analysis of school shooting data. Six people — three children and three adults — were killed. There have been 130 mass shootings so far in 2023, the highest number of shootings recorded at this point in any year since at least 2013, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. Child and teen mortality overall surged during the Covid-19 pandemic — driven not by Covid-19 deaths but by fatal injuries, according to a new study in JAMA. Firearms accounted for nearly half of the increase in mortality in 2020.",0
433,FDA sketches out plan to bolster fragile US infant formula supply management,"The US Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday its initial strategy to boost and strengthen the management of the country's supply of infant formula. The announcement came just ahead of a hearing of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about what went wrong during last year's infant formula shortage.  Committee members and experts who testified were critical of formula makers and the FDA's food safety program, which the agency has pledged to revamp in order to protect the nation's food supply and promote better nutrition. Many experts are concerned that the formula shortage of 2022 could easily happen again, even with those changes. ""While we stand here today, more than a year since the recall, it is my view that the state of the infant formula industry today is not much different than it was then,"" testified Frank Yiannas, who stepped down from his role as the agency's deputy commissioner of food policy and response in late February.  ""The nation remains one outbreak, one tornado, flood or cyberattack away from finding itself in a similar place to that of February 17, 2022.""  A formula shortage that started in 2021 was exacerbated when the United States' largest infant formula maker, Abbott Nutrition, recalled multiple products in mid-February and had to pause production after FDA inspectors found potentially dangerous bacteria at its Sturgis, Michigan, plant.  A former Abbott employee filed a whistleblower complaint about the plant with the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in February 2021. The complaint suggested that the plant lacked proper cleaning practices and that workers falsified records and hid information from inspectors.  The complaint was filed February 16, 2021, and was passed on to Abbott and the FDA three days later. Yiannas testified that because of the siloed nature of the agency, he wasn't made aware of the complaint until February 2022. It was only then that he learned that children had gotten sick with Cronobacter after consuming powdered formula made at the plant.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated at least four illnesses and two deaths in three states in connection. The agency sequenced bacteria from two of the children to compare against the samples the FDA took at the facility, but it did not find that the samples were closely related.  Abbott said in a statement Tuesday that ""the quality and safety of our products is always a priority -- and it's important to remember that no sealed, distributed product from our Sturgis, Mich., facility tested positive for the presence of Cronobacter."" ""As part of Abbott's quality processes, samples from every batch of powdered infant formula products are tested for Cronobacter, and they must test negative before any product is released,"" the company said. Yiannas said at the hearing that manufacturing runs are tested in such a way that it would not necessarily catch all contamination. Cronobacter infections are rare but can be serious and even fatal, especially in newborns. The bacteria lives in the environment, but when these infections are diagnosed in infants, they are often linked to powdered formula. ""Clearly, I really wish, and I should have been notified sooner, so I could have initiated containment steps earlier. Had that happened, I believe we might not be here today,"" Yiannas said Tuesday. ""Had the agency responded quicker to some of the earlier signals, I believe this crisis could have been averted or at least the magnitude lessened."" With more demand for other brands after the Abbott recalls, families across the country had to hunt through multiple stores for formula last year. Stock rates of baby formula stayed lower than they were the year before for much of 2022. Even in October, when rates had improved, nearly a third of households with a baby younger than 1 said they had trouble finding formula over the course of one week, according to a survey by the US Census Bureau. The FDA said Tuesday that its new national strategy helps ensure that the country's supply of formula will remain constant and safe.  The agency said it will work with the industry on redundancy risk management plans that will help companies identify possible supply chain problems. It will also continue to enhance inspections of infant formula plants by expanding and improving training for agency investigators.  According to the strategy, the FDA will expedite review of premarket submissions for new products to prevent shortages. It will continue to closely monitor the formula supply and has developed a model to forecast any potential disruptions.  It also plans to work closely with the US Department of Agriculture to build in more resiliency with its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children program, or WIC, the nation's largest purchaser of infant formula. The new strategy is just a first step; the long-term strategy is expected to be released in early 2024. Dr. Susan Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a statement that the new strategy aims to incentivize ""additional infant formula manufacturers to enter the market."" Many parts of the strategy are underway, the FDA said. ""Safety and supply go hand-in-hand. We witnessed last year how a safety concern at one facility could be the catalyst for a nationwide shortage. That's why we are looking to both strengthen and diversify the market, while also ensuring that manufacturers are producing infant formula under the safest conditions possible,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a news release. ""Now, with this strategy, we are looking at how to advance long-term stability in this market and mitigate future shortages, while ensuring formula is safe."" Formula stock rates are still not where they once were before last year's crisis, Yiannas said, but the problem can't be solved overnight. He said it was a good step for Congress to ask for a resiliency report from the industry. One positive development that came out of the crisis is that manufacturers are reporting formula volume to the FDA on a weekly basis even though there is no legal requirement to do so, he said.  Historically, the FDA has focused on food safety and nutrition, not supply chain availability, but the Covid-19 pandemic opened eyes and served as the ""biggest test on the US food system in 100 years,"" Yiannas said. Food supply shortages made experts realize that the agency needed more intelligence on how companies' supply chains worked.  ""Progress is being made, but it's not being made fast enough,"" Yiannas said. The FDA is now tracking sales and stock rates of baby formula. He said he's talked to formula companies that say they have ramped up production, even though they might have cut back on the number of varieties of product they offer.  Abbott said in its statement Tuesday that it is running its US facilities at increased capacity and is importing additional formula from Europe to meet US needs. It is also building a new $500 million plant in the US. The FDA said Tuesday that it has also done a study to better understand what led to the recall of infant formula at the Abbott plant. The agency had conducted a routine surveillance inspection at the plant in September 2021 and even then found problems like standing water and inadequate handwashing among employees.  Abbott is facing additional investigations from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice as well as lawsuits from customers. Yiannas told the House committee Tuesday that one strategy to head off similar shutdowns would be to require manufacturers to report Cronobacter bacteria found in its products. Currently, only the Abbott plant in Michigan is required to report the bacteria as part of the consent decree that allowed it to reopen. The FDA said in November that it would like Cronobacter infections added to the CDC's list of national notifiable diseases, which would require doctors to report cases to public health officials so the CDC and the FDA could keep better track of infections. Only two states have such a reporting requirement now.",0
434,Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The damage to the human body caused by firearms,"One of the most memorable lectures during my first year of medical school at the University of Michigan was delivered by Dr. Julian ""Buz"" Hoff. He was the chair of neurosurgery and a master at teaching the natural history of brain diseases. We learned about brain tumors, vascular diseases and trauma.  Hoff had a way of explaining things that made them really stick, and that was particularly clear in his lecture called ""GSW."" Anyone who works in a hospital probably knows that the acronym GSW stands for ""gunshot wound,"" and the way Hoff wanted us to learn the topic was for us see the impact firsthand. So on the last day of his class, we went to an outdoor gun range in Ann Arbor for our GSW lecture. There were handguns there, as well as rifles. In the distance, I saw several watermelons on top of old barrels that would serve as targets. After putting in his ear plugs and donning safety glasses, Hoff shot a watermelon with a handgun. I saw the bullet hit the watermelon but wasn't confident I saw the bullet exit. The watermelon was then brought to us for inspection.  First thing to notice, he told us: There was an obvious entrance and exit ""wound,"" and they were around the same size. We could see the green skin folding in on itself around the entrance wound and the outward beveled tissue around the exit. After we chopped the watermelon open, he pointed out that the bullet seemed to have traveled in a fairly predictable trajectory, a linear bullet-sized line through the body of the watermelon. Next came the same demonstration with a rifle. This time, I saw the watermelon shudder as it was struck and then immediately saw a significant amount of red tissue fly out the backside. Upon inspection, the first thing I noticed was how much bigger the exit wound was, compared with the entrance. And after opening the watermelon, the purpose of the demonstration became clear: Instead of a predictable linear track, the watermelon looked like it had been cored out and what was left was shredded. He explained that this was a phenomenon known as cavitation, which is just what it sounds like: The bullet doesn't simply travel through the body, it creates a big cavity inside it.  The message was clear: I want you to imagine that had been a human body.  Much in the way pictures of black lungs had left an indelible impression of smoking on all medical students, Hoff had done the same with me for GSWs. I was reflecting on that demonstration recently when I operated on a patient with a GSW to the head. It was a handgun injury, and we were able to quickly control the bleeding and relieve the pressure on the brain. The patient spent one day in the ICU for observation and was discharged a few days later. Had it been a rifle injury, there was hardly any chance he would've survived.  With guns front and center yet again with the recent shooting in Nashville, I wanted to share what I have learned over the years about what bullets do to the human body and the challenge it is for surgeons to repair the damage. More damage Nearly 30 years after my med school gun range demonstration, Dr. Ernest E. Moore, trauma surgeon and director of trauma research at the Shock Trauma Center named after him at Denver Health, is also using the watermelon example to draw a comparison between different firearms.  ""I often use the analogy that the injury to the liver [with a semi-automatic rifle] would be similar to just taking a watermelon and dropping it on the cement. It's incredible the amount of energy delivered. ... By comparison, the 9 millimeter would drill a hole through the liver. So you'd have a sizable hole, but if you didn't hit a major blood vessel, it's a pretty tolerable injury. In fact, we in civilian trauma will often manage a 9-millimeter liver injury without an operation, whereas a patient with an assault rifle would be dead within 20 minutes if you didn't operate,"" he said. Other human tissue in the body reacts differently. ""If you struck a bone with an AR-15, like your femur in your leg, it would literally shatter into multiple fragments that would sort of serve as secondary missiles. Whereas ... we've seen 9 millimeters that will actually drill a hole right to the femur,"" he said. (An AR-15 is a lightweight semi-automatic -- that is, self-loading -- rifle manufactured by Colt; other gunmakers make rifles in a similar style.)  Moore also brings up cavitation as a way of visualizing what is happening in the body. He describes cavitation ""as the result of a rapid expansion of the tissues surrounding the path of the bullet. ... In essence, instead of a virtual drill hole with a 9 millimeter, your path of injury in tissue with an AR-15 will be 6 inches wide. And the path beyond that is even wider, but the tissue recoils back into it,"" said Moore, noting that inelastic tissue -- like the liver, heart and brain -- are the most vulnerable to this type of energy. A brief history of the AR-15-style weapon Although the Department of Justice noted last year that 77.2% of mass shootings -- which it counts as four or more deaths, excluding the shooter -- involve handguns, many of the highest-profile incidents involved assault-style rifles: the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; Orlando's Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016; the 2017 shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas; and the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida; the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, and the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, just to name a few.  This kind of rifle unleashes a lot of power, said Moore, who, in addition to being a trauma surgeon since 1976 (who operated on some of the Columbine survivors), co-edited a major textbook on trauma surgery, authored more than 1,700 scientific articles and was the longtime editor of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. ""The capacity for tissue injury is reflected in the so-called kinetic energy. And the kinetic energy, simplistically, is the mass or weight of the bullet times the velocity squared. So the velocity -- the speed of the bullet exiting the gun -- is really its primary effectiveness,"" he said. Moore said a 9-millimeter handgun has a muzzle energy -- the kinetic energy of a bullet as it leaves the gun's muzzle -- of roughly 400 foot-pounds of force. For a rifle like the AR-15, that number is 1,300. ""So you have a huge increase in the amount of energy imparted from the gun,"" he explained. He said the size of the bullet has less to do with the damage it causes. ""I think there are some misconceptions with ... rifles. A lot of people say, 'Oh, they're big bullets.' Actually, they're small bullets -- interestingly, they're even smaller than many handguns. So the actual bullet that's discharged from an AR-15, for example, is a half the size of the bullet from a 9 millimeter. The difference is the ... velocity,"" he said.  And, if that rifle is a semi-automatic weapon, the weapon can be fired repeatedly, without manually reloading, simply by pulling the trigger. In Uvalde, hundreds of rounds were fired into classrooms in the first four minutes, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw.  Moore, who grew up in a hunting family, owns firearms and is an avid hunter, has been outspoken in his opposition to civilians owning AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons and does not own one himself.  ""The rifle that our military uses to fight our enemies is the same rifle that we allow civilians access to and can create these mass shootings,"" he said.   An Emmett Till moment During my neurosurgery training and the first several years of my career, I didn't encounter these sorts of injuries. That's because between 1994 and 2004, certain semi-automatic firearms were banned. In fact, it was in 2003, while I was covering the war in Iraq, that I first saw the damage these weapons cause on the human body, not just a watermelon.  I was embedded with the Devil Docs, the Navy medical team that provides front-line medical care for the Marines. There are things that my cameraman Mark Biello and I saw on the battlefield that we still have a hard time talking about. They are still hard to even write about. Limbs blown clean off the body and wounds so horrific, I thought for sure they must've been caused by a bomb or IED.  I never imagined that just a couple of years later, I would see the same sorts of injuries in US cities, including my own, Atlanta. Those are the days when I come home from the hospital simply unable to talk, let alone describe what I had just witnessed.  Still, as you may have read after the tragedy in Uvalde last year, some folks raised whether we should have an ""Emmett Till moment.""  Emmett Till was a 14-year-old Black teen who was abducted and violently murdered in 1955 by white racists in Mississippi after a white woman accused him of whistling at her. Till's mother took the unusual step of holding an open-casket funeral and allowing a photographer from Jet magazine to photograph her son's disfigured, unrecognizable face to show the country the result of racial violence. Many consider that moment a turning point in the country's collective support for the civil rights movement. Many of my colleagues have urged me to further describe the horrific injuries I have seen over the last nearly 20 years as a neurotrauma surgeon.  The truth is, I'm not sure America is ready to see that. More important, it isn't a decision anybody can make unless it's their loss and their story to tell -- like Emmett Till's mother. Public health emergency Louis Klarevas, research professor at Columbia University and author of the 2016 book ""Rampage Nation,"" credits the 10-year federal assault weapons ban between 1994 and 2004 with significantly reducing the number of mass shooting incidents and deaths (which he defined as injuring or killing six or more people) before rebounding to even higher levels after the ban expired. In 2020, there were an estimated 20 million AR-15 style weapons in circulation in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Between 1990 and 1999, during the decade in which I traveled to that gun range with Hoff, mass shootings claimed an average of 21 lives per year; from 2012 to 2021, that average had gone up to 51, according to the Violence Project. It defines a mass shooting as four or more people in a public place being killed with firearms, without any underlying criminal activity, excluding the shooter. (CNN defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people other than the shooter are injured or killed by gunfire during one event.)  Federal data on the overall impact of gun violence is lacking. Even obtaining the basic numbers can be a challenge, as I learned writing this article.

435,Xylazine test strips available to help users check for animal sedative in drugs,"The biotech company BTNX says it is shipping out new test strips this week that detect the presence of xylazine, an animal sedative that officials say is increasingly being mixed with fentanyl. As with fentanyl test strips, these pieces of paper have a reagent that can help users detect whether a drug has any xylaxine in it. Commonly called ""tranq"" or ""tranq dope,"" xylazine has not been approved for human use. The drug has heavy sedative effects like an opioid but isn't one, so it doesn't respond to the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone, also known as Narcan. Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, and users say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high. However, the drug is also associated with severe soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. The US Drug Enforcement Administration issued a public health alert this month noting that xylazine is widespread and has been detected in about 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pill seizures. The test strips cost $2 each and are sold in boxes of 100, BTNX marketing manager Molly McKay said in an email to CNN. The strips are inserted into a mixture of water and the drug to be tested, and they return a positive result when xylazine is present. However, they cannot test for quantity or potency of the drug. A study published last week by the City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health found the test strips to be highly sensitive and said they gave false results only when lidocaine was also present in the drug mixture.                                                                                                                                                                               This kind of drug testing or drug checking is a way of making drug use safer that's commonly known as harm reduction.  Instead of demanding complete abstinence, harm reduction takes mitigation steps to keep users safe, like improving access to clean needles and naloxone.",0
436,What one millennial with phone anxiety did when she stopped texting to stay connected,"Some of my earliest memories from growing up in the late 1980s were of my mom spending hours on the phone with my grandmother, my aunt and her best friends.  There was a daily circuit of female communication that kicked off sometime right after breakfast. Between the daily advice doled out by television hosts Oprah and Phil Donahue, there were regular check-ins, gossip fests and venting sessions.  I definitely didn't follow in her (dialing) footsteps. As a proud elder millennial, I fully embraced text culture in my early 20s.  Unless there was a life-threatening emergency or someone had died, a casual text was enough. It felt considerate. Familiar. Direct. For decades, I did my best communicating via a keyboard.  Then the pandemic took over, and my world closed in. As many Americans stayed home in 2020, my circle became impossibly small. Even as a card-carrying introvert, I realized I missed the sound of someone's voice — and one voice in particular — my mom's.  That's when I picked up the phone. And what I found was a wealth of simple comfort that had always been waiting on the other end of the proverbial phone line. Week after week during the height of the pandemic, hearing my mom's voice made me feel less lonely.  How often, when feeling poorly, even as adults, do we wish for Mom to take care of us? The pandemic made physical contact nearly impossible, but I still felt cared for through our conversations. The power of my mom's comforting voice is backed up by research. A 2021 study found that ""Although e-mail and other text-based media can be excellent for scheduling meetings and sending spreadsheets, connecting with others is better done using one's voice.""  Finding a sense of shared well-being through conversations that forge strong bonds can be especially true for women. ""When women feel socially connected and supported, they are not only better equipped to cope with challenges, pursue their goals, and enjoy a higher quality of life, but also to improve the lives of everyone they are connected with,"" said Kristjan Archer, a senior communications consultant at Gallup, in a March 8 blog post. Most US women —  72%, in fact — often find some of that connection speaking on the phone, according to the accompanying Gallup poll. I discovered many benefits of voice-to-voice contact, especially when it came to connecting with my parents and older relatives, most of whom were born in the 1960s or earlier. Those of us born in the 1980s and later are fluent in communicating our emotions via text characters, but that's not always true of our elders.  The pandemic made me see the value of my mom and dad's way of doing things. Tone and intent come across so much more clearly when we're talking on the phone. I needed to know — especially then — how my parents were doing. And even now, I want to hear it in their voices.  Tone is especially lost in texting. How often are relationships severed or at least damaged over a text miscommunication? Someone is trying to be funny or sarcastic, and the little emoji they've snuck in at the end of their text doesn't convey their emotion properly, and suddenly Aunt Margaret's side of the family has decided to skip your Thanksgiving celebration this year.  There is also the benefit of a wandering conversation. During lockdown in particular, we had nothing but time. If you have the luxury of time, letting a conversation meander can be a beautiful thing. I learned so much about my parents, our family history, silly stories from my childhood and things that surprised me during our phone chats.  During one summer phone call, my dad, a Vietnam veteran who has never wanted to discuss his experience there, found out from my mom that I'd been binge-watching Ken Burns' docuseries ""The Vietnam War,"" and jumped on the phone to discuss it with me. For the first time in my memory, my dad shared anecdotes from his time in the US Navy aboard the aircraft carrier where he spent the war.   I started saving up stories to share on our weekly calls and making notes of questions to ask later. And I started to schedule more phone calls with my siblings and close friends who live in different states, sometimes video chatting so I could see the speaker's face.  I've even started speaking with my author friends, a group of people who have long preferred email and text. I realized just how good it felt to hear their voices and to really know if they were emotional or happy or uncomfortable or even lonely. Walking while talking I also found I could easily fit in phone calls during my weekly routine. I started putting in my earbuds and calling my mom while we were both on walks. I'd call my sister when I was in my car on my way somewhere. I called my best friend while cleaning the house and my writing critique partner while painting my nails. (I couldn't type and walk or drive or dust, so this new development was a win.) I may be making the switch sound as if it was an easy transition, but I had phone anxiety and it took practice. I loved making appointments and reservations online because I didn't have to talk to anyone. And when my phone rang, no matter who it was, spam or relative, I would freeze up.  But when I started practicing, I got better at it. Here's how I did it.  How to practice phone calls Start with strangers. Scheduling doctor's appointments, calling your kid's school and ordering takeout are all instances where the other person is supposed to be patient and professional with you. You aren't an inconvenience calling the restaurant down the street because you are contributing to its business. Take a deep breath, make sure you have a notepad and pen within reach, and make the call. Write it down. Here's a tip straight from my 12-year-old, who tends to feels nervous ordering aloud at restaurants: She writes her order down, verbatim, to read aloud when the server asks. If you have to make an appointment, write down what you need, when you're available and so forth. In fact, I used to write down my character's names when I would take calls about my books because when I'm nervous I forget everything I've ever known.  Schedule your calls in advance. Sometimes I make a standing phone call, like with my mom. Sometimes the minute I get off the phone, I email or text the person and say, ""When should we talk next week/month/whatever?"" It eases my mind to know the person I am calling expects me and has dedicated time to speak with me, and that can go both ways. Be honest. I was honest with myself and the people I was talking to. I explained that I'm rusty on phone calls but wanted to make a concerted effort to be more present and keep in touch. I found if I was willing to make the effort, they were often willing to do the same. That's the thing about talking on the phone. They can hear how much I meant it.",0
437,"Government to step up efforts to monitor health of East Palestine residents, first responders","Almost two months after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in the town of East Palestine, Ohio, the state Department of Health is preparing to offer blood and urine testing and physical exams to first responders who rushed to fight the blaze.  The testing is set to start within the next two weeks and will be the first step in a long-term effort to monitor the health of responders to the accident, according to an email obtained by CNN.   This move closely follows an announcement that a health assessment clinic for East Palestine residents that has been operating out of a local church will become permanent and expand its services. Roughly 300 firefighters from 50 departments -- many of whom were volunteers -- responded to the derailment and fire, which happened the night of February 3 and continued to burn for several days.  Many of the firefighters had their gear ruined by the heat and chemicals. Some wore breathing apparatus to protect themselves from the fumes and smoke, but others didn't have or didn't know that they needed self-contained breathing apparatus to protect their lungs and airways, according to firefighters who were at the scene and spoke with CNN. The email about health testing, which was sent to area fire chiefs Sunday, says the long-term monitoring plans for the first responders are still being developed, but a first step will be the physicals, which will include ""blood work, urinalysis, and an exam."" It does not describe what the tests will look for or their purpose. The Ohio Department of Public Health said in a statement Monday that it ""has been working with the East Palestine fire chief to make sure responders' unique needs are addressed. ""In early March, ODH began soliciting first responders to voluntarily fill out a specialized After Chemical Exposure (ACE) survey, and more than 200 have filled those out so far. This collects information on type of exposure and PPE worn as well as any health impacts responders may be experiencing,"" the statement says. ""The next step in our comprehensive plan of ongoing monitoring of first responders involves creating a clinical service within the next several weeks. This service is in the planning stages and many details still have not been determined, but it would include voluntary laboratory testing."" In addition to the testing through the health department, firefighters who responded to the derailment will be followed by the Firefighter Cancer Cohort Study, Candice McDonald, deputy chief executive of the National Volunteer Fire Council, said Monday. The study, which is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, aims to follow 10,000 firefighters for 30 years to learn more about how their exposures contribute to cancer risks. Cancer caused by chemicals in smoke is the leading cause of death for firefighters, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters. First responders to the Ohio derailment were among the most heavily exposed to a cocktail of chemicals that spilled into the ground and nearby creeks. David Comstock, chief of the Western Reserve Joint Fire District, says there are still a lot of unknowns about the nature of the chemical hazards that the firefighters were exposed to that night. ""One of the things that I've raised is, what's in tank car A? And what's in tank car B? But what happens when they mix and burn? Now, what do I have?"" he said.   Comstock says that three firefighters from his station responded to the derailment and were 50 to 100 feet from a burning railcar. He asked them what was in the derailed cars, ""and my crews couldn't answer me,"" he said. It was hard to get information about the chemicals on the scene, he said.   He arranged physical exams for the firefighters at his station within a week, but he wishes they had happened even faster. He spoke to some doctors who advised blood testing within 48 hours. ""Your blood, your body, processes many of the chemicals out of it within that time period, that they don't become detectable at that point,"" he said.  It's unclear how much information testing will yield now, Comstock said, but he hopes the exams and tests from the Department of Health will offer a baseline so the first responders will know if their health changes over time. East Palestine residents will also soon get expanded access to health services.  The temporary health assessment clinic that opened in downtown in the wake of the train derailment will remain open permanently, Gov. Mike DeWine testified Wednesday before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.   ""We started back clinic shortly after this tragedy occurred. This morning ... I met with medical leaders from the East Liverpool City Hospital. And we are announcing today that we'll be making this clinic into a permanent clinic for the community,"" DeWine said last week. ""This is going to be a full-service clinic that will provide comprehensive care and treatment. Anybody can walk in anyone can be treated. And this is a long-term commitment to the health of the people of East Palestine,"" said DeWine, who offered his testimony remotely, from the library of East Palestine High School. DeWine gave few details on the services that might be available to the clinic or who would ultimately pay for them. Currently, residents can walk into the clinic to get information about their risk, answer questions as part of an ongoing health study, and meet with a physician to get a basic exam and advice on any necessary follow-up care. DeWine suggested that these offerings might be expanded under a partnership with East Liverpool City Hospital.  His comments were also an acknowledgment of ongoing health needs in the community. East Palestine residents are ""worried about their future they're worried about where things are going to be in five or 10 or 15 years. It's important that they be able to continue to get assessed,"" he said.   DeWine said it would be particularly important for the health of the first responders to continue to have regular checkups. ""They all need to be assessed. That needs to be established -- a baseline -- and they need to be assured that in five years or 10 years, there's still a place where they can go."" DeWine said Norfolk Southern would be expected to pay for those things. ""We look to the railroad to establish that fund,"" he said.",0
438,"Strong, steady friendships may be an asset to your physiological health, study shows","Good friends and good physical health may be even more closely linked than previously thought, new research has found. Researchers discovered that positive social experiences impact not only a person's stress level and ability to cope, but also markers of physical health, according to a study published Monday in the journal Society for Personality and Social Psychology. The study followed more than 4,000 people over three weeks as they completed check-ins every three days on their smartphones or smartwatches regarding their positive and negative experiences with their closest social relationships, as well as assessments of their blood pressure, heart rate, stress and coping. Having more positive experiences in social relationships was generally associated with better coping, lower stress and lower systolic blood pressure, or spikes in blood pressure under stress, according to the study.  But having social relationships which bounce between good and bad often can be unhelpful. When there is a lot of volatility, the negative experiences seemed to have a bigger impact on a person than the positive, said lead study author Brian Don of the University of Auckland.  ""Both positive and negative experiences in our relationships contribute to our daily stress, coping, and physiology,"" Don said in a statement. ""Additionally, it's not just how we feel about our relationships overall that matters; the up's and downs are important too."" The results are not surprising, given that previous studies have also documented a link between healthy relationships and healthier bodies, said Dr. Kathleen Mullan Harris, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Harris was not involved in the study. But seeing how friendships affect specific aspects of physical health does add to the scientific understanding of the connection, she said.  The research, which took place from 2019 to the end of 2021, may also offer insight into the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which put strain on social relationships for many people, Don said.  ""Because the COVID-19 pandemic has created considerable strain, turbulence, and variability in people's relationships, it may indirectly alter stress, coping, and physiology in daily life, all of which have important implications for physical well-being,"" he added. Do good friendships lead to better health? It is important to remember that the study cannot prove that good relationships cause better health, Don said.  But it does show that physical health and social relationships are often intertwined, he said. And the association can also work the other way, Harris said. ""People who are in better health often have better relationships with people, because they're not moody, they're not grouchy, they're not in pain, they don't have worries,"" she said.  Don hopes that future studies expand the areas that are investigated. ""It would be useful to examine other physiological states, such as neuroendocrine or sympathetic nervous system responses as outcomes of daily positive and negative relationship experiences, which may reveal different patterns of associations,"" he said.  Making better relationships If hearing the importance of good social relationships makes you lament that you might not have enough, you aren't alone, said Adam Smiley Poswolsky, workplace belonging expert and author of ""Friendship in the Age of Loneliness.""  Many people may feel lonely and want closer connections, but the prospect of making new friendships — or strengthening existing ones — can be daunting, Poswolsky said.  ""It's intimidating to think about friendship in adulthood, and often overwhelm keeps us from even trying,"" he said. His suggestion? Start small. Text a friend that you haven't talked to in a long time, commit to meeting one new person a month, host a dinner party, or join a class. ""If you do just one thing, make a list of five people in your life that you care about, and give one of them a phone call,"" Poswolsky added. ""The most remarkable friendships often begin with tiniest moments of connection."" Remember that you likely won't form a strong connection overnight, he added.  Research shows that it takes 90 hours of time together to consider someone a friend and more than 200 hours to consider them a close friend that you have an emotional connection with, he said.  ""In our busy world, we need to put our friendship on the calendar, and commit to recurring activities,"" Poswolsky said.  But studies also reveal that it isn't just about having relationships — the quality matters. There might not be just one definition of a good friendship, but most strong relationships share some similar qualities, he said.  They tend to prioritize laughter, joy, excitement, courage, vulnerability, affirmation and a lack of judgment, Poswolsky said. And good friendships are often two people helping each other become better versions of themselves, he added. ""Even when — especially when — their friend is struggling or going through something hard,"" Poswolsky said. ""You know someone is a true friend when they have your back when you're sick, when you lose your job, when you make a mistake, when you're going through a break-up, when you're stressed, when you're sad.""",0
439,"Coffee drinkers get more steps but also less sleep, study finds","Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, but the pendulum has swung back and forth about its benefits and drawbacks.  New findings from a small study published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, suggest both upsides and downsides: Drinking at least a cup of coffee per day might make you move more but sleep less — and it might put you at higher risk for one type of heart palpitation.  ""The big picture finding is that there isn't just one single health-related consequence of consuming coffee, but that the reality is more complicated than that,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.  ""The great majority of research on the topic has been observational, meaning we just look and see at what happens to people who do and don't drink coffee, which is profoundly limited by the possibility that ... there may be some other characteristic that is driving whether someone happens to drink coffee,"" Marcus said. ""The only way to mitigate those potential effects was to conduct a randomized interventional trial.""  To get a better idea of coffee's immediate health effects, the authors recruited 100 healthy adults who were age 39 on average and from the San Francisco area. They equipped the participants with Fitbits to track their steps and sleep, continuous blood glucose monitors and electrocardiogram devices that tracked their heart rhythms. Each participant was randomly assigned to drink as much coffee as they wanted for two days, then abstain for two days, repeating that cycle over a two-week period.  On coffee-drinking days, participants got an average of 1,058 more steps than they did on abstention days, the authors found. But on those days, sleep took a hit, with participants getting 36 fewer minutes of shut-eye. The more coffee they drank, the more physical activity and the less sleep they got.  Coffee seemed to affect the heart, too. Researchers found no evidence of a significant relationship between coffee consumption and premature atrial contractions, which are ""very common, early heartbeats that we all experience arising from the top chambers of the heart,"" Marcus said. They can feel like a flutter or skipped beat in your chest.  ""People with more premature atrial contractions are at higher risk of developing a very clinically significant heart rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation,"" he added.   But drinking more than one cup per day resulted in about a 50% higher incidence of premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs, compared with days of no coffee intake.  These heartbeats arise from the lower chambers of the heart, and they can also feel like a skipped beat or heart palpitations.  ""So this provides some compelling evidence that experimenting with (going) off coffee might be worthwhile in those individuals who experience bothersome palpitations related to PVCs,"" Marcus said.  ""There's also evidence that in some people, more PVCs can lead to a weakening of the heart or heart failure,"" Marcus added. ""So it may be that if someone is especially concerned about risks of heart failure — such as they have a family history of it or there's some other indication that their physician tells them (makes) them at risk — they may want to steer clear of coffee.""  Peter Kistler, who is head of electrophysiology at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, described the study as strong but cautioned that ""this is a short-term study in healthy volunteers.""  ""This provides no information on the long-term benefits or adverse effects of long-term coffee drinking,"" said Kistler, who was not involved in the study. ""This does not provide information on the impact of coffee in people with other health conditions, and generally (the study participants) consumed modest amounts of coffee.""  Health effects of coffee When people drink coffee, they might have more motivation to exercise or have enhanced performance once they start moving, Marcus said.  But people ""shouldn't extrapolate that to taking energy drinks or high-dose caffeine as a way to enhance workouts,"" since high doses can lead to disturbances, he said.  That coffee drinking led to less sleep perhaps isn't surprising, but a potential genetic aspect to that finding might be. Researchers collected DNA samples from participants, and those who had greater reductions in sleep when they consumed coffee had genetic variants associated with slower caffeine metabolism. People with genetic variants associated with faster caffeine metabolism, on the other hand, had more premature ventricular contractions.  These findings suggest that an individualized approach to coffee consumption might be the most appropriate method for determining effects on health, according to the study.  Kistler had another view on the finding of diminished sleep.  ""Coffee is the most common 'drug' for cognitive enhancement,"" he said. ""People who drink coffee are less tired. This is not necessarily a negative.""  Regarding the links between coffee intake and premature ventricular contractions, caffeine can contain active metabolites such as aminophylline, which is used in asthma medications and, in high doses, is known to induce arrhythmias, Marcus said.  Additionally, ""coffee tends to increase activity in the sympathetic nervous system, or the adrenaline side of the nervous system, that can promote PVCs,"" he added.  What this means for you  The effects the study found are worth considering based on your personal health goals, Marcus said.  ""Individuals can be reassured that there's certainly no imminently dangerous effects of drinking coffee,"" Marcus said.  Wondering whether you're a fast or slow metabolizer of caffeine? There aren't really any clinical tests in the consumer market, Marcus said, but you might be able to find out by using a DNA test that measures this.   You can also pay close attention to what your experiences might be telling you about your tolerance.  ""If they begin to feel anxious (and) tremulous on one cup of coffee, then they are a slow metabolizer,"" Kistler said via email. ""But if they have a higher tolerance then they are metabolizing coffee more rapidly.""",0

441,Let your pantry work for you with these easy kitchen organization tweaks,"Home organization shows can be simultaneously uplifting and deflating with rows of matching containers on every shelf of the pantry and cabinets. Typically they're in a gleaming white kitchen, no less. Let's leave the aesthetics aside for a moment, because I will be honest and tell you that I do not own a gorgeous kitchen. It is downright ugly in many respects, but it is functional. And function is the reason I'm making the argument that you should store your pantry ingredients in containers. Even if you're not using matched sets of brand-new modular storage or bins (and I'm not suggesting that you do), decanting ingredients from their bags and other packaging into containers is a smart move. Here's why I do it and why I believe everyone should start containing their ingredients. You'll save space and fit more in the pantry There's no one-size-fits-all solution for pantry storage because every kitchen layout has its own specific challenges. However, a general rule of thumb is that containers are simpler to store in cupboards and on shelves than bags.  Instead of piling bags and digging through the stack to find what you're looking for, containers are stackable and easily movable. One wrong grab can send a cascade of snack bags or granola bars crashing to the floor, but containers keep food in check. Both glass and plastic are durable, though families with kids frequently prefer plastic containers because of the weight and breakability factor. As for round versus square containers, ""round ones don't maximize the space in between"" as effectively as square or rectangular containers do, said Shara Kay, a Los Angeles-based certified professional organizer and owner of SK Organizing. My pantry storage situation includes a mix of airtight plastic rectangular containers, glass mason jars, larger restaurant-style food storage bins and repurposed containers — all from various brands in various sizes. Some are ingredient-specific, such as those for my brown sugar and granulated sugar, and others are generic containers.  For those with deep pantry shelves, a hybrid solution — aka ""containers for your containers"" — might be necessary. Open-top or open-front pantry storage bins can help group similar items together and allow you to pull out one large container rather than a lot of small jars or canisters. This works well for keeping ingredients such as baking soda, baking powder, vanilla extract and other baking-related items together.  If your shelves are less than 12 inches deep, according to Kay, you may not want to double up on bins. But if you have a deeper reach-in pantry, ""you probably do, because things will get lost in the back."" In my pantry, I have a mix of purchased bins and repurposed open box-style containers, including a few old letter trays from my office that hold small mason jars of my granola, dried fruit and other breakfast snacks. You'll waste less food Clear containers can help people visualize what they have immediately, Kay said, making it easy to see if there's enough penne in the pantry for tonight's dinner or if it's time to restock the black bean stash. If you always end up buying an extra box of pasta because you can't remember what you have on hand, containers may help with overbuying. Airtight containers also keep snacks and other loose items from losing their crunch too quickly. ""If you're taking a long time to consume things and they're going stale,"" Kay said, ""that's a good instance to decant."" Bag clips can't maintain an airtight seal, but if you store your half-open bags of Cheez-Its in a sealable container, you're winning the war. However, you'll still need to do routine pantry maintenance to make sure you're not leaving foods in bins for too long. It's smart to use the first-in, first-out rule with your ingredients, whether they're in the pantry, fridge or freezer. I personally don't buy so much food that I won't use it before it goes stale or past its expiration date, but if that's an issue in your house, keep track with writable stickers on your containers and bins. And if you have a few handfuls of ingredients left, Kay said, ""when you're decanting, use up the stuff at the bottom before adding to the top.""  Your food will be pest-proof No one wants to believe they could get pests in their pantry, but it's better to think about this situation before it happens. And as someone who lives in a century-old home, I'm here to give you the news firsthand: The pests will take the smallest opportunity to invade every single time. Whether plastic or glass, sealed containers are the best line of defense against rodents and insects. Kay's rule is ""the more airtight, the better,"" but I'll go one further. Containers beat bags every time because I have yet to meet a mouse, ant or moth that can penetrate a rigid container. And I unfortunately can't say the same for store packaging — even sealed cardboard boxes.  You don't need to go out and buy all new containers As convincing as my argument for containers may be, it doesn't mean you have to buy out your local home goods store immediately. Start with the containers you have on hand, such as mason jars or plastic bins. Or if you need to buy a set of containers, ""start with five and see how it goes,"" Kay said. ""If it's working for you, then acquire more."" Similarly, ""don't go decanting every single snack in your pantry on the first go-round,"" Kay added. She recommends starting with baking staples such as flour and sugar as well as other items that are usually scooped and measured incrementally rather than all at once. Rice or grains and dried beans are ideal candidates, as are nuts and dried fruit. For those who still want to keep ingredients in their bagged packaging, you have two options. One is to store your open bags of snacks in larger sealable containers, as mentioned earlier, and the second is to stack your bags in open-top bins.  ""My family won't eat some food if it's not in the original packaging because they're drawn to the original packaging,"" Kay admitted. As you start transitioning to the container method of pantry storage, you'll find the right balance for your family as well.",0
442,Four California sea otters died from an unusual strain of a parasite that could pose a risk to humans,"Four sea otters in California have died from a rare strain of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite that scientists said could pose a risk to human health. Researchers called the finding a ""complete surprise"" because this strain of T. gondii had never been reported in any aquatic animal or in coastal California. Their study, led by researchers from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and University of California, Davis, was published this week in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. ""Since Toxoplasma can infect any warm-blooded animal, it could also potentially cause disease in animals and humans that share the same environment or food resources, including mussels, clams, oysters, and crabs that are consumed raw or undercooked,"" Melissa Miller, a California Department of Fish and Wildlife researcher and author of the paper, said in news release. The four sea otters stranded from 2020 to 2022, and each had an ""unusual and severe"" condition called steatitis, or inflammation of body fat. Toxoplasmosis is common in sea otters, and it's known that it can be deadly, the researchers wrote, but this strain of T. gondii was able to rapidly kill apparently healthy adult otters. No cases have been reported in humans, but researchers called the otters ""important sentinels"" of the circulating strain, which could be a risk to people eating seafood or ingesting contaminated water. ""Because this parasite can infect humans and other animals, we want others to be aware of our findings, quickly recognize cases if they encounter them and take precautions to prevent infection,"" Miller said. ""We encourage others to take extra precautions if they observe inflamed systemic fat deposits in sea otters or other marine wildlife."" Most people infected with T. gondii have no symptoms and aren't aware of their infection, but severe toxoplasmosis can cause damage to the brain, eyes and other organs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy and can lead to significant health problems after birth. People at higher risk for severe infection are infants born to mothers who were infected during or shortly before pregnancy and people with weakened immune systems. To prevent any toxoplasmosis infection, the CDC recommends typical food safety practices such as cooking foods to a high internal temperature, rinsing fruits and vegetables and washing utensils.  Cat feces is known to contain high levels of the parasite, so the CDC urges people to keep pet cats inside, change the litter box every day -- before the parasite becomes infectious -- and wash hands well. In the study, the researchers said more work is needed to investigate habitat or climate change factors that may have led to the spread of the rare strain in otters, and to examine whether other aquatic wildlife are infected.",0
443,California bill aims to ban sale of popular candies containing ingredients that may cause health issues,"Some chemicals linked to health issues have been banned in food products in the European Union, while the United States has allowed use at levels determined safe. A bill recently introduced in the California State Assembly could start to change that.  Assembly Bill 418, or AB 418, seeks to prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of food products in California containing red dye No. 3, titanium dioxide, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil or propylparaben, according to a news release from the Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel's office, who introduced the bill with fellow Democratic lawmaker Buffy Wicks. If passed, the bill would go into effect January 1, 2025.  Titanium dioxide is a powder used as a white colorant or to give a smooth texture in candies and other processed foods. Potassium bromate is added to baked goods to help dough strengthen and rise higher. In some beverages, brominated vegetable oil keeps citrus flavoring from floating to the top. Propylparabens are used for antimicrobial food preservation.  In the EU, these chemicals are banned ""due to scientific studies that have demonstrated significant public health harms, including increased risk of cancer, behavioral issues in children, harm to the reproductive system, and damage to the immune system,"" Gabriel's news release says.  A search of the Environmental Working Group's Eat Well Guide returns nearly 3,000 products that use red dye No. 3 as an ingredient, including popular candies such as Skittles, Nerds candies and Trolli gummies; protein shakes; instant rice and potato products; and boxed cake mixes.  The National Confectioners Association, a trade organization based in Washington, DC, released a statement on March 23 in response to the bill's introduction: ""Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy, as they have been for centuries. We strongly oppose AB 418 because there is no evidence to support banning the ingredients listed in the bill. The ingredients that would be banned under this proposal have all been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we do not use any ingredients in our products that do not comply with the FDA's strictest safety standards."" ""We know that they are harmful and that children are likely eating more of these chemicals than adults,"" Susan Little, senior advocate of California government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, said in Gabriel's release. ""It makes no sense that the same products food manufacturers sell in California are sold in the EU but without these toxic chemicals."" FDA loophole The chemicals can be used in foods because of a loophole in the US Food and Drug Administration's Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that's known as the Generally Recognized as Safe rule. In the context of food, the guidance states the use of certain additives is not subject to premarket approval requirements if the additives meet specific criteria that experts have deemed to be safe for consumption.  A California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment study that found red dye No. 3 can make children vulnerable to behavioral difficulties — such as decreased attention — also concluded that current federal levels for safe intake of food dyes might not protect children's brain health. The analysis noted that the current legal levels, set decades ago by the FDA, don't consider newer research, according to the Environmental Working Group.  An FDA spokesperson declined to comment to CNN due to the pending legislation.  Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, expressed support for the bill during a Thursday news conference advocating for the removal of red dye No. 3 from food products. ""As California goes, eventually so goes the nation because manufacturers don't want to make things that they can't sell to the fifth-largest economy in the world,"" Birnbaum said. ""So California's actions have major impact not only in the US but worldwide.""  How to avoid some of these ingredients  The FDA requires manufacturers to list red dye No. 3 as an ingredient on food labels. Those who are concerned should check ingredient lists as a first step. Red dye No. 3 is listed as ""FD&C Red #3.""  In medications, you can look for dyes in the ""inactive ingredients"" section or look for dye-free versions of some drugs, Consumer Reports suggests.",0
444,"Autism diagnosis has become more common, but pandemic disrupted early detection, CDC says","The rate of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has been growing steadily since 2000, but two new reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight disparities in the types of children identified to have autism spectrum disorder and setbacks in early detection.   In 2020, about 1 in 36 children had been diagnosed with autism by age 8, according to the CDC -- about 2.8%. That's up from a prevalence of 1 in 44 children in 2018 and 1 in 150 children in 2000. But according to the CDC, this long-term trend has ""largely been interpreted as improvements in more equitable identification of (autism spectrum disorder), particularly for children in groups that have less access or face greater barriers in obtaining services."" For the first time, diagnosis was more common among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it was among White children. The CDC researchers note that this shift ""may reflect improved screening, awareness, and access to services among historically underserved groups."" In fact, between 2018 and 2020, autism prevalence rose more than twice as fast among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it did among White children.  These findings are based on surveillance data from 11 communities that participate in the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. The data are not nationally representative and vary widely by location -- from a prevalence of 1 in 22 children in California to about half as many in Maryland. The CDC says more research is needed to understand this variation, which could be related to differences in the strategies used to identify and diagnose the condition. Still, some trends have stayed consistent.  Autism prevalence is significantly higher among boys than girls -- in 2020, there was about a four-fold difference. But it was the first year that more than 1% of 8-year-old girls had been diagnosed with autism.  Also, disparities persist in identifying autism in children who also have an intellectual disability. In 2020, more than half of Black children diagnosed with autism also had an intellectual disability, compared with less than a third of White children. According to the researchers, this finding suggests a need to better detect and evaluate developmental concerns beyond cognitive ability.  Generally, children who have intellectual disabilities are more likely to be diagnosed with autism earlier. But early detection is important for all children with autism, as it helps connect them with helpful resources and interventions.  In recent years, good progress had been made in early detection of autism -- an earlier CDC report found that children born in 2014 were 50% more likely to receive an autism diagnosis or special education by age 4 than those born in 2010. Another new report published by the CDC on Thursday shows that there was evidence of continued improvement in these trends through February 2020, but the trends reversed as the Covid-19 pandemic hit with ""sustained lower levels"" of evaluations and identification of autism across most of the surveillance network.  In first six months of the pandemic, there were 217 fewer evaluations for every 1,000 children at age 4 than there were four years earlier. There were also nearly three fewer identifications for every 10,000 children, according to the CDC report.  ""Disruptions due to the pandemic in the timely evaluation of children and delays in connecting children to the services and support they need could have long-lasting effects,"" said Dr. Karen Remley, director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. ""The data in this report can help communities better understand how the pandemic impacted early identification of autism in young children and anticipate future needs as these children get older.""",0
445,'Harry Potter' and 'Game of Thrones' franchises to get fresh life on newly minted Max streamer,"Fantasy freaks and noble nerds unite.  Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Wednesday that the 'Game of Thrones' and 'Harry Potter' franchises will take on new life at the studio's newly minted streaming service Max.  For those who are eager to soar back into the wizarding world of 'Harry Potter,' buckle up because the franchise is coming to Max in the form of a scripted television series. (CNN and Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) The series will be a ""faithful adaptation"" of the beloved ""Harry Potter"" books by author J.K. Rowling, who will also serve as an executive producer on the project, according to a news release. Rowling's ""Potter"" books were published between 1997 and 2007.  The television series will feature a cast of fresh new faces to take on the roles made famous in the ""Potter"" films by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.  The series is expected to run for an unprecedented 10 years with the promise that each season ""will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core.""  Over in Westeros, Max will launch a second prequel series in the ""Game of Thrones"" universe, titled ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight"" based on author George R.R. Martin's 2013 ""Dunk and Egg"" novellas.  The prequel is set a century before the events of the original ""Game of Thrones,"" which ran from 2011 to 2019, and will center on the wanderings of ""two unlikely heroes,"" Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, according to a news release. ""Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends,"" the release said.   The announcement for a new ""Thrones"" prequel comes after ""House of the Dragon"" debuted in 2022. ""Dragon"" is also a prequel series, based on the Targaryen civil war and set nearly 200 years prior to ""Game of Thrones."" It's based on Martin's ""Fire & Blood"" book from 2018.   Release dates for both new series have not yet been announced.",0

""At this time, we can confirm law enforcement officials are in contact and Mr. Bell is safe,"" the updated post reads. An earlier post on the department's verified Facebook account Thursday had read, ""Officers are looking for Jared Bell, DOB 06/27/1986."" ""He should be traveling in a 2022 grey BMW and his last known location is potentially the area of Mainland High School on 4/12/2023,"" according to the post.

448,Father of Lisa Marie Presley's youngest daughters petitions to represent them in battle over estate,"A court hearing was held in Los Angeles on Thursday related to the petition Priscilla Presley filed in January that challenges the validity of her daughter, Lisa Marie Presley's will.  Priscilla Presley did not appear at the hearing, nor did her grandaughter, actor Riley Keough, who is the primary beneficiary of Lisa Marie Presley's estate. The court on Thursday considered an ex parte petition filed by Michael Lockwood, the father of Lisa Marie Presley's youngest daughters, twins Finley and Harper, to be named their guardian ad litem regarding their late mother's will. Scott Rahn, Lockwood's lawyer, said he is ""ready, able and willing to protect their interests.""  Attorneys for Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough did not contest Lockwood being named their guardian ad litem. Judge Lynn Healy Scaduto said she would issue a written ruling on the matter. Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis Presley's only child, died in January after being hospitalized following an apparent cardiac arrest at her Los Angeles home.  In a court filing obtained by CNN, Priscilla Presley's petition disputes a 2016 amendment to her daughter's will which states that Lisa Marie Presley removed her mother and former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees, replacing them with her children Riley and Benjamin Keough. Benjamin Keough later died in 2020. The petition alleges that Priscilla Presley did not receive the amendment while her daughter was alive, as required by her Trust, and that the document misspells Priscilla's name. The petition also alleged that the amendment was not witnessed or notarized and questioned the authenticity of Lisa Marie Presley's signature.  Attorneys for Priscilla Presley filed the petition just days after Lisa Marie Presley was laid to rest at Elvis's former residence, Graceland. The next hearing to address the matter is scheduled for May 16.",0
449,Warner Bros. Discovery unveils super-streamer 'Max',"Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday unveiled ""Max,"" its high-stakes super-streamer that unites some of the company's most storied brands under one roof and aims to aggressively compete in the streaming marketplace as the traditional linear television business rapidly declines. The new service, announced by CEO David Zaslav at a press event Wednesday, will launch May 23 and give consumers access to a large library of programming across Warner Bros. Discovery's sprawling portfolio: Warner Bros., HBO, HGTV, Food Network, Cartoon Network, TLC and others. ""It's the one to watch,"" Zaslav said, referencing the service's tagline, ""because we have so many of the world's iconic and globally recognized franchises. It's our superpower."" The streaming platform is a service ""every member of the household"" can go to for entertainment, he added. Max subscribers can choose from three price tiers. The least expensive is $9.99 a month and will show ads. The ad-free version will cost $15.99, the price of the company's existing HBO Max service. That tier will let customers stream on two devices at once and download up to 30 titles, but the content will be available only in high-definition rather than 4K. Users who want the higher-resolution 4K streams will have to buy the Max ""ultimate plan"" for $19.99 a month, which includes up to four concurrent streams, 100 downloads and Dolby Atmos sound. Existing HBO Max customers will be transitioned to the new service without any action on their part. Those users, said, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery told CNN, can keep existing features like 4K HDR resolution for a limited period before being prompted to move into the ""ultimate plan."" The Max platform was born of the mega-merger announced between WarnerMedia and Discovery in 2021 and completed last year. Warner Bros. Discovery is also the parent company of CNN. 'Attack plan' for news and sports Company executives have touted the combined streaming service as unique in its content mix: It packages award-winning prestige programming like HBO's ""Succession"" and ""House of the Dragon"" with unscripted shows like HGTV's ""Fixer Upper"" and TLC's ""90 Day Fiancé."" Zaslav also hinted that news and sports programming will factor into the service in the future, given that Warner Bros. Discovery owns properties such as Turner Sports and CNN. ""We are a global leader in sports and we are a global leader in news,"" Zaslav said. ""And in a few months we will come back to you on our attack plan to use this important and differentiating content to grow our streaming business even further."" The Max service represents the future for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has been entrenched in a traditional TV business that is declining as audiences switch to streaming.  Other companies enmeshed in the cable business have also moved in recent years to launch streaming platforms, including Disney, NBC, and Paramount. But none of these companies have achieved the success of Netflix, which pioneered the streaming business and has more than 230 million global subscribers. Warner Bros. Discovery hopes that it will amass 130 million subscribers by 2025. At the launch event, the company's streaming chief Jean-Briac Perrette discussed several improvements to the HBO Max interface to increase retention and engagement, adding that the company had invested in machine learning so home feeds can recommend content using a ""human-plus-machine approach."" But subscriber growth for streaming services has slowed in recent years as the market becomes more saturated. Some companies have introduced lower-priced ad-supported plans to draw people in.  Increasingly, executives have moved to highlight profitability over subscriber growth as the most important barometer for a company's success. Netflix even announced last year that it would stop providing guidance for its membership, stating that the company is ""increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top-line metric.""",0

451,Who is trans advocate Dylan Mulvaney?,"Dylan Mulvaney is a uniquely 21st-century star. She became famous on TikTok, where she pivoted from musical theater to advocacy when she came out as trans. She's scored major brand sponsorships and made the jump to fame off-platform, even interviewing President Joe Biden.  Her online persona is an overwhelmingly positive one. But when she started posting videos sponsored by Bud Light, Olay and Nike, her accounts became flooded with anti-trans hate.  CNN has reached out to Mulvaney's representatives for comment. Mulvaney's brand partnerships have triggered a new wave of anti-trans attacks. Many of those critics -- including celebrities and members of Congress -- misgender, degrade and even threaten her in their comments. Her response, so far, has been to tune them out, even when the hateful rhetoric escalates. Mulvaney became a pandemic-era TikTok star Mulvaney started her career in the theater, touring across North America as one of the principal cast members of the hit musical ""The Book of Mormon."" But in 2020, when the pandemic canceled most in-person events, Mulvaney turned to TikTok. She posted cheerful and informative clips about her life as a queer person. After cultivating a sizable following during the pandemic, Mulvaney came out as a trans woman in March 2022. She was ""scared and a little bit ashamed to even consider (herself) back on the binary,"" she told fans -- she had come out as nonbinary earlier during the pandemic -- but ultimately realized she wanted to ""honor that inner child"" who knew for years she was a girl.  Thus began her TikTok series ""Days of Girlhood,"" in which she documented almost every day of her transition, from her experience with hormone-replacement therapy to hatred from anti-trans opponents to the results of her facial feminization surgery, or FFS.  Other notable moments include day 221, on which Mulvaney interviewed President Joe Biden for Now This News and asked Biden whether he supported states' rights to ban gender-affirming health care. He told her he didn't support it, citing his late son, then-Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, who advocated for measures that would protect trans residents of Delaware. And on day 279, the day before her surgery, she said she was doxxed, meaning a viewer leaked her home address online without her consent. She celebrated day 365 in March with a live performance at Rockefeller Center's Rainbow Room, with proceeds donated to the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ suicide prevention organization.  Big brand partnerships draw anti-trans ire With her growing popularity online, Mulvaney began partnering with big brands, including Kate Spade, the natural deodorant company Native and the hair care line Olaplex. But a brief digital ad for Bud Light caused some fans of the brand to send a deluge of anti-trans hate her way.  In the clip, filmed shortly after she celebrated day 365, Mulvaney joked that she didn't know what March Madness was but planned to enjoy it with a can of Bud Light. The brand also sent her a personalized can with her face on it. Bud Light's sponsorship of Mulvaney caused some anti-trans critics to call for a boycott of the brand. Kid Rock filmed himself shooting cases of the beer, ending his video with ""f**k Bud Light and f**k Anheuser-Busch."" GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas called the ad ""stupid"" in an Instagram video in which he said he would ""throw out every single Bud Light in the fridge"" only to open his garage mini fridge and find no Bud Light cans. However, there were several Karbach beers in the fridge, which is a brand owned by Anheuser-Busch, Bud Light's parent company. The Daily Beast wrote that Crenshaw's attempts at a boycott ""failed."" In a statement to outlets including Rolling Stone and Buzzfeed, Anheuser-Busch said earlier this month: ""Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.

This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public."" Bud Light has not posted to its Instagram account since before Mulvaney shared her ad on April 1.  Similar anti-trans hate followed after Mulvaney posted an ad for Nike this month. The sportswear brand responded with a comment on one of its recent Instagram posts that doesn't contain any images of Mulvaney after countless Instagram users flooded the comment section with negativity toward Mulvaney. ""You are an essential component to the success of your community! We welcome comments that contribute to a positive and constructive discussion,"" Nike wrote in the comment, pinned to the top of the post. ""Be kind (heart emoji) Be inclusive (heart emoji) Encourage each other (heart emoji).""  Mulvaney also recently appeared in a TikTok ad for Olay that caused some anti-trans users to call for a brand boycott.  The backlash has also drawn some high-profile figures, including Howard Stern and Rosie O'Donnell, to speak out in support of Mulvaney. ""As long as you ain't hurting anybody, I'm on your team,"" Stern said during an episode of his Sirius XM radio show. The vitriol aimed at the TikTok star is just the latest in a growing trend of hatred aimed at queer and trans people in the US. Data from the ACLU shows that, as of April 3, a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced this year -- 417 in 2023, compared to 180 bills last year -- and many of them are aimed at trans young people trying to access gender-affirming health care. Mulvaney has spoken about how the gender-affirming care she's received has ""brought (her) so much peace"" and should be more widely available to trans people who seek it.  Mulvaney says she tries to tune out anti-trans hate In an interview with Rolling Stone last week, Mulvaney said that while she first tried to give her anti-trans critics a chance, she realized their positions were rooted in ""pure hatred.""  ""I've now made a little bit of peace with the fact that people have a problem with my transness or with my joy,"" she told Rolling Stone earlier this month. ""And that's on them. That has nothing to do with me, and I have to think about the people that I look up to that celebrate this version of myself. Those are the people I should be listening to."" She posted a more succinct message on her social profiles.  ""This song felt fitting given the week I've had,"" she wrote in a caption accompanying a clip of her Day 365 performance, in which she sang ""No One is Alone"" from the musical ""Into the Woods."" ""Thank you all for making me feel supported, I am not alone.""",0

453,'Renfield' sinks its teeth into gore at the expense of its Dracula satire,"Dwight Frye is hardly a household name, but the character actor left his mark on Universal horror movies of the 1930s, including his portrayal of Dracula's maniacal henchman in the Bela Legosi classic. Enter ""Renfield,"" a cheeky homage to the vampire genre that blends horror and comedy into a beyond-bloody cocktail, with Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage sinking their teeth into the too-thin material. Produced and conceived by Robert Kirkman of ""The Walking Dead"" renown, ""Renfield"" begins promisingly enough, with Hoult's Renfield -- Dracula's ""familiar,"" or the human servant who tends to his daytime needs -- sitting in on a support group for people in abusive relationships. There's also a spot-on replication of the old black-and-white movies, with just the smallest hint of Renfield's wheezing laugh. Those wrinkles, however, amount to false advertising for a movie that derives most of its humor from over-the-top gore, an amusing-in-theory notion that inevitably yields diminishing returns even spread over a relatively brisk 90-some-odd minutes. ""Renfield"" is so much better when the film is having fun with vampire-movie minutia -- like Dracula (Cage) needing to be invited into places, or the particulars of how to kill him -- that the broadness of those visual gags make it feel like an underachiever, especially when compared to something that gets the balance right, like the FX series ""What We Do in the Shadows."" Directed by Chris McKay (""The LEGO Batman Movie"") from a script by Ryan Ridley, ""Renfield"" also introduces a sort-of relationship between its title character and a principled cop, Rebecca (Awkwafina, underemployed here), who brings out his desire to be a better man. Then again, he's already exhibited those impulses by having sought to steer his boss toward more-deserving victims, while Dracula thirsts for nuns and cheerleaders. The makeup effects are bountiful and fairly impressive, with Renfield deriving super-human strength from consuming insects, which he gets to put into use against the mobsters Rebecca is obsessed with putting behind bars. Yet the way those visual elements are applied does more to narrow the movie's appeal than expand it, catering to a subset of the horror audience at the expense of those who might show up expecting something closer to a Mel Brooks-like spoof. What's billed as a horror-comedy thus can't entirely decide where it wishes to land on that spectrum, in a movie that benefits from letting Cage cut loose without fully capitalizing upon his full-throated performance. Universal has creatively sought to mine equity from its monster library, and ""Renfield"" certainly brings those efforts into the 21st century, for better and worse. And while Renfield might be trapped in a ""destructive relationship"" with a cruel and demanding master, the filmmakers have only themselves to blame for their questionable choices. ""Renfield"" premieres April 14 in US theaters. It's rated R.",0
454,'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's' final season sticks to the same old routine,"The curtain is coming down on ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" whose act -- an Emmy winner in its first season -- has seen better days. Having left its mark for Amazon, the nostalgic comedy tries to bring home the story of its central character without venturing far from the rat-a-tat tone that defined the series initially, and that by season five, has grown tedious. Reflecting that the end is nigh, several of the episodes incorporate flash-forwards, providing a tantalizing taste of the future Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) and how her showbiz career (and by extension, life) has gone. That journey begins with Midge's agent, Susie (Alex Borstein), trying to land her a job writing for the latenight TV show hosted by Gordon Ford (Reid Scott, an excellent regular addition), a thinly veiled stand-in for Johnny Carson who is going toe-to-toe with Carson's predecessor, Jack Paar. Midge's interactions within that male-dominated bastion introduce a nice hook for the new season, which now takes place, largely, in the early 1960s. Midge also deals with a lot of the usual mishegas involving her parents (Tony Shalhoub, Marin Hinkle) and in-laws (Kevin Pollak, Caroline Aaron), while her ex-husband Joel (Michael Zegen) wrestles with his own issues after their split. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino specializes in characters that all tend to speak with the same witty voice, and exposing Midge to comics and comedy writers makes that tick feel a little less conspicuous. It's also interesting getting a glimpse of where Midge wound up, as well as the influence that her rising star had on those around her. For the most part, though, the last few seasons of ""Mrs. Maisel"" have felt like a comic stalling for time, vamping until the next act can make it to the mic. The initial conceit of a woman stumbling into standup in the 1950s possessed a clear charm -- particularly with Lenny Bruce's in-and-out presence, as played by Luke Kirby -- that the series often lacked as Midge settled into the business, facing the various challenges and impediments thrown her way. Despite the quality of the cast and the knowing winks to the excesses and sexism of its era, ""Mrs. Maisel"" has always felt like a particularly light construct, which is why the prospect of a final season in theory provides the show with a level of focus and momentum it has lacked. And to some extent, that's true. Having come this far, there's inevitable curiosity about what the world held for a promising female comic who had the audacity to start slinging jokes in the Eisenhower era. But watching these episodes, with their detours and digressions, it seems fairly clear that for better or worse, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" can't stray too far from the comfort of its old routine. ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" begins its fifth and final season April 14 with three new episodes on Amazon's Prime Video.",0

457,"One year after their Virginia defamation trial, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have found peace abroad","One year after the start of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's highly publicized defamation trial, CNN has learned from sources close to the actors that the former couple has moved on from their legal battle.  Their dramatic televised trial in Virginia began last April and concluded in June, when the jury in the case found both Heard and Depp liable for defamation in their lawsuits against each other. Depp was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million dollars in punitive damages. The jury awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages and no money for punitive damages. In December, Heard announced that she and Depp had settled their defamation suit, writing on Instagram that she had ""made no admission"" and that the settlement is ""not an act of concession.""  ""I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder,"" Heard said in her post. Damages owed to Depp by Heard were reduced to $1 million as part of the agreement, which Depp's attorneys said in a statement at the time he pledged to donate to charity. ""We are pleased to formally close the door on this painful chapter for Mr. Depp, who made clear throughout the process that his priority was about bringing the truth to light,"" said Depp's attorneys Benjamin Chew and Camille Vasquez. CNN has contacted representatives for Heard and Depp to inquire if the settlement and charitable payments have been made. More recently, both actors have been photographed spending time in Europe, with Depp in England and Heard on the island of Mallorca in Spain.  ""After the trial Johnny started working on a new film project and he's been touring with his band,"" an individual close to Depp told CNN. ""Everything is going really great."" A source close to Heard confirmed she was living on the Spanish island with her daughter and partner, Bianca Butti. ""She's just focused on being a mom right now,"" the individual close to Heard told CNN. ""The trial took an emotional toll on her and she just wanted to get away from the noise and disappear from Hollywood."" Heard's next movie project is ""Aquaman 2,"" which is due out in December.

458,"Snoopy is real! Meet Bayley, the cartoon dog's doppelganger","Calling all cute pet lovers, i.e., everyone. The Instagram account for a certain Mini Sheepadoodle named Bayley is going viral, thanks to the adorable black-and-white pooch's astounding and uncanny resemblance to Snoopy, the canine mascot for the Peanuts cartoon troupe. Bayley, who according to the pup's Instagram page will be two years old next month, sports the same oblong face as Snoopy, along with the exact same color distribution -- a white face and muzzle, adorable round black nose and furry, floppy black ears. The pooch is also surprisingly photogenic, posing calmly for perfect photos and video throughout the pet-centric social media page. While Snoopy is known to be a beagle, Bayley's breed of Mini Sheepadoodle -- the result of crossing an Old English Sheepdog with a Miniature Poodle -- has resulted in a near carbon copy of the drawn animal, in real life. Snoopy is the famously silent dog that originated in the ""Peanuts"" comic strip by Charles M. Schulz in October of 1950. He also appeared in various ""Peanuts"" television specials, and has been a fixture as a giant balloon in New York City's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Snoopy is showing up elsewhere in the news on Wednesday, as a t-shirt sporting his personage is gaining in popularity as part of a nationwide American Red Cross-led effort to drive up blood donations.  On Tuesday, on the occasion of National Pet Day, Bayley's owner posted yet another irresistible snippet of the gorgeous animal, along with the caption, ""Mom says I am the cutest pet she has ever seen but to be fair, I am her first and the only furbaby.""",0
459,"Judge in Dominion case sanctions Fox for withholding evidence, plans to appoint special master to probe possible misconduct","The judge overseeing Dominion Voting Systems' massive defamation case against Fox News said Wednesday that he plans to appoint an outside attorney to investigate whether the right-wing network lied to the court and withheld key evidence, and sanctioned Fox over the matter. ""I am very concerned... that there have been misrepresentations to the court. This is very serious,"" Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Wednesday at a pretrial hearing in Wilmington, where he repeatedly expressed exasperation and frustration with Fox's attorneys. The sanction Davis imposed against Fox will allow Dominion to conduct additional depositions of some Fox witnesses, if they want to, at this late stage in the case. Fox must make those witnesses available and pay for the depositions. These extraordinary moves, on the brink of trial, are the latest blows to Fox News as it tries to fend off the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit that Dominion filed over the network's promotion of the false claim that its voting software rigged the 2020 election. Jury selection is set to begin Thursday, with opening statements following on Monday. Davis said he would appoint a so-called ""special master"" to investigate whether Fox previously made assertions to the court that were ""untrue or negligent."" The special master's inquiry appears to be twofold: First, Did Fox withhold key materials from Dominion during the discovery process? And second, did Fox mislead the court by obfuscating Rupert Murdoch's role at Fox News? Fox had previously told Dominion and the judge that Murdoch was only an officer at Fox Corporation and didn't have any role in Fox News. Dominion says this distinction may have narrowed what Fox turned over as part of the discovery process -- like internal emails, text messages and other material. Fox denies that it ever defamed Dominion, and says it properly disclosed Murdoch's roles in its public financial filings. Fox attorney Dan Webb said at Wednesday's hearing that ""nobody intentionally withheld information"" from Dominion. 11th-hour drama  The special master will look into what sanctions might be appropriate against Fox, including potentially instructing jurors that Fox inappropriately blocked Dominion from obtaining key evidence. Fox said it would oppose this move, and the judge said he'll decide later in the case. I'm very uncomfortable right now,"" Davis said, after dressing down Fox's lawyers from the bench. The judge ordered Fox lawyers to preserve ""any and all communications"" related to the Murdoch issue, expressing alarm that they may have deliberately provided him with inaccurate information. The 11th-hour drama escalated Wednesday when Dominion played previously unaired tapes of Fox News host Maria Bartiromo talking in November 2020 with then-Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. In the tapes, Giuliani told Bartiromo he ""can't prove"" some of his allegations about Dominion, and Bartiromo expressed interest in promoting Powell's fundraising website on her broadcast. Dominion lawyer Davida Brook said Fox had only turned over the material last week, after Bartiromo's former senior producer Abby Grossberg revealed in a lawsuit that the recordings existed. ""We keep on finding out about missing documents in this case, not from Fox, but from others,"" Brook said. The judge agreed that the material was ""extremely relevant"" and chided Fox yet again, in what has become a near-daily occurrence as the case careens toward trial. ""Abby Grossberg is not Dominion's problem. It's not my problem. Abby Grossberg is a Fox problem. She was an employee at Fox. She is relevant to the case,"" Davis said. ""These tape recordings... they relate directly to one of the statements we are litigating... The question is, are there other documents like that out there?"" A Fox lawyer said that the company had given Dominion more than a million documents and denied that it tried to suppress any evidence in the case. ""As counsel explained to the Court, Fox produced the supplemental information from Ms. Grossberg when we first learned it,"" a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the hearing.",0
460,Ariana DeBose will return to host the 2023 Tony Awards,"And she's back.  Ariana DeBose is set to return as the host for the 2023 Tony Awards in June, the Broadway League and The American Theater Wing, the organizations that produce the Tony Awards, announced on Wednesday.

463,"Judge rules Dominion can't bring up January 6 at Fox News defamation trial, scolds Fox attorneys over Rupert Murdoch's role","Dominion Voting Systems can't bring up the January 6 insurrection during its upcoming defamation trial against Fox News, a Delaware judge ruled Tuesday, who also revealed at a hearing that he has been receiving death threats. The voting technology company sued Fox News over the right-wing network's promotions of false claims that Dominion machines rigged the 2020 election. But almost all of the allegedly defamatory statements mentioned in Dominion's lawsuit occurred before the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said at a hearing Tuesday that invoking January 6 would be too prejudicial with the jury, and that the case isn't about whether Fox News ""influenced"" the insurrection.  ""That may be for another court at another time, but it's not for this court at this time,"" Davis said.  The judge issued rulings on nearly two dozen pretrial motions that will set the stage for the historic trial, which is set to kick off this week, with jury selection on Thursday. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. Fox says it didn't defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Threats against the judge The judge also revealed Tuesday that he has received death threats.  ""I've sent you things that I've received,"" Davis told lawyers from both sides, during a discussion about separate death threats targeting Dominion employees.  The discussion revolved around whether Dominion can bring up the threats and harassment that its employees have faced after the 2020 election, which one Dominion lawyer said has instilled ""terror"" among its employees and has ""devastated"" the company's ability to recruit and retain staff.  Davis ruled that Dominion can tell the jury about the existence of the threats, but can't get into the content of the threats, because Fox obviously doesn't directly control what uninvolved third parties say.  ""I'm not downplaying it,"" Davis said to the Dominion lawyers. ""You need to take every threat seriously. I take every threat seriously."" Dominion has argued that many of the threats were inspired by Fox, which the network denies. If Dominion wins, it wants Fox to pay for the beefed-up security measures that it implemented after 2020.  A court spokesperson declined to comment about the threats against Davis. The judge did not disclose any details about the threats against him, or whether any of them were deemed credible. Flurry of pretrial rulings Davis ruled in Dominion's favor on other key questions, blocking Fox from making some First Amendment arguments and from bringing up evidence that it thought would help its defense.   The judge ruled that Fox can't bring up broadcasts where reporters accurately fact-checked Trump's lies about the 2020 election, to prove that other broadcasts that amplified those lies weren't defamatory.  Those other broadcasts ""are not relevant"" to the case, Davis said, because ""you can't absolve yourself of defamation by putting someone else on at a different time"" who told the truth about Dominion.   The judge also ruled that Fox can't use internal Dominion emails where its staffers said their products ""suck"" and were ""riddled with bugs,"" to prove that there were real concerns about Dominion machines. Those emails weren't public in 2020, so they couldn't have influenced the state of mind of Fox staffers when they promoted the Dominion claims on their shows.  But if Dominion wins and the case moves to damages, Fox can bring up these emails to show that Dominion might be losing business because of voting security concerns and not just because of alleged defamation.  Later in the hearing, Davis cleared the way for Dominion to bring up Fox's financial information at the trial, including details about salaries of top hosts and executives. Fox tried to block this from the trial, arguing that salaries aren't linked to ratings, and that this data could bias the jury against the network.  ""Economics are relevant,"" Davis said.   Judge scolds Fox for obfuscating Murdoch's role In an unexpected twist near the end of the daylong hearing, the judge scolded Fox's lawyers after Dominion revealed that network had serially obfuscated Rupert Murdoch's official role at the company. Murdoch is the chairman of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News. The network's lawyers have maintained for years that he had no official title at Fox News. But over the weekend, they conceded that he is also an officer at Fox News. This distinction -- albeit technical -- could have significant legal implications. Dominion claimed this blocked them from getting Murdoch-related documents in discovery. And by further tying Murdoch to Fox News, and not just to its parent company, Dominion may have more paths to prove actual malice. ""You have a credibility problem,"" Davis told Fox's lawyers, adding, ""I don't know if this is something that we have to turn the battleship around,"" with the trial looming, but ""I need to feel comfortable that when you represent something with me that it's the truth -- and that was not true."" A Fox lawyer pushed back by saying Murdoch's role at Fox News was just an ""honorific title"" and that he wasn't directly involved with any of the allegedly defamatory broadcasts after the 2020 election. ""I hope you're not being cagey with me,"" Davis continued. ""...I don't know why this is such a difficult thing... To say you don't know who your officers are, seems extremely bizarre to me."" As the hearing wrapped, Davis brought up the subject again, clearly frustrated by the revelation. ""I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the situation I'm in,"" Davis told the Fox lawyers. ""...It was represented to me on multiple occasions that he's not an officer at Fox News."" In a statement late Tuesday night, a Fox spokesperson pushed back on Dominion's claims that it withheld information about Murdoch's role. ""Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings since 2019 and this filing was referenced by Dominion's own attorney during his deposition,"" the spokesperson said.",0

470,Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi hint they're engaged,"British actress Millie Bobby Brown has fans thinking she and partner, Jake Bongiovi, are engaged, after the couple posted photos to social media on Tuesday. The ""Stranger Things"" star took to social media to share a photo of her and Bongiovi embracing -- and eagle eyed fans have spotted a rather large ring on her engagement finger. ""I've loved you three summers now, honey, I want 'em all,"" the actress, 19, captioned the image.  Earlier this year, she referred to Bongiovi, who she has been linked to since 2021, as her ""partner for life.""  Bongiovi, 20, also shared images on social media around the same time Tuesday, including one of the couple hugging and looking out to sea, captioned ""Forever.""  Bongiovi is one of Bon Jovi rocker Jon Bon Jovi's four children, who he shares with wife Dorothea Hurley.  Brown has previously confirmed that she met Bongiovi ""on Instagram."" ""We were friends for a bit, and then, what can I say?"" she told WIRED magazine. CNN has reached out to representatives for Brown for comment. Brown shot to fame for her starring role as the telekinetic Eleven in ""Stranger Things,"" which will conclude with Season 5, according to Netflix.  Since her ""Stranger Things"" debut, she has starred alongside Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes' sister in ""Enola Holmes"" and ""Enola Holmes 2,"" and launched her own beauty line. Last year, she revealed she had enrolled in Purdue University and is attending classes online.",0
471,Hollywood writers hold strike vote Tuesday,"The Writers Guild of America is set to hold a strike authorization vote on Tuesday. If it passes, which it is expected to, that will allow leadership to call a strike if the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers do not reach a new contract agreement by May 1.  ""The studios need to respond to the crisis writers face,"" WGA leadership said in a message to members ahead of the vote. ""WGA members must demonstrate our willingness to fight for the contract writers need and deserve by supporting a strike authorization vote."" The two sides have met a few times since negotiations began March 20. The WGA is calling for additional compensation and residuals from features in theaters or on streaming platforms, an end to the abuse of ""mini-rooms"" (smaller number of writers in the room) and increasing contributions to pension and health funds.   Voting opens Tuesday at 8:30 pm local time on both the the west and east coasts and closes on Monday, April 17, at 12 pm local time, with vote results to follow.  ""Studios have been getting away with murder and they know it. I think that the money is still there,"" said Ashley Lyle, WGA member and a writer on the Showtime show Yellowjackets, in a video message to members.  But the AMPTP, which represents studios and streamers, said the entertainment industry has changed in recent years and writers need to make concessions. ""The AMPTP companies approach this negotiation and the ones to follow with the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority,"" AMPTP said shortly before negotiations began. ""We are all partners in charting the future of our business together and fully committed to reaching a mutually beneficial deal with each of our bargaining partners. The goal is to keep production active so that all of us can continue working and continue to deliver to consumers the best entertainment product available in the world.""  AMPTP represents Amazon, Apple, CBS, Disney, NBCU, Netflix, Paramount Global, Sony, and CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.  WGA said its writers are unfairly compensated as streaming popularity — and its share of Hollywood's revenue — grows. ""The business has transitioned to a streaming-first model, with the legacy film and television markets representing a declining share of total revenue,"" WGA wrote in the report.  The survival of the writers' profession is at stake, as companies ""slashed compensation,"" WGA said in the message to members. The media industry is struggling as advertising revenue has evaporated over the past year, and companies have announced mass layoffs. The WGA announced a two-week break in negotiations starting April 1. But, according to an industry insider close to the negotiations, WGA and AMPTP met last Wednesday for the most engaging session yet. Neither side has made any counter offers to the opening proposals, the person with knowledge of the matter said. Negotiations are slated to pick up again the week of April 17.  The last writers' strike was in 2007 and lasted 100 days, bringing Hollywood production to a screeching halt.   ""Three weeks is plenty of time to hammer out a deal, negotiations in 2017 went right down to the wire,"" the industry insider says of the looming May 1 deadline.  The WGA-AMPTP negotiation is the first of three contract negotiations with entertainment unions. The Directors Guild of America will start negotiations on May 10 ahead of their contract expiration on June 30. The Screen Actors Guild contract also expires June 30.",0
472,"Sky News Australia quits TikTok, says security risks 'too great' for media","Australian broadcaster Sky News has left TikTok because of security concerns that have led several Western governments to ban the video app on devices used by officials. In an article published on the Sky News Australia website Monday, digital editor Jack Houghton said the security risks posed by the ""Beijing-controlled platform"" were ""too great for any serious news publisher."" ""TikTok is a spy network masquerading as a social media platform which has been proven to illegally pilfer the data of journalists, public citizens and politicians,"" Houghton wrote.  ""We urge [media organizations] to consider this dilemma and stop trading security and integrity for a few worthless views,"" he added. In a statement to CNN, Lee Hunter, General Manager of Operations for TikTok in Australia and New Zealand, said he respects the broadcaster's right to make decisions to best serve its audience, but rejected the ""allegations and insinuations"" made in the Sky News Australia article. ""[They] are completely false and we reject them in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. Experts say the security fears behind the recent government bans, while serious, currently appear to reflect only the potential for TikTok to be used for foreign intelligence, not that it has been. There is still no public evidence the Chinese government has actually spied on people through TikTok. Sky News Australia is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and is a separate entity to UK broadcaster Sky News, which is owned by Sky Group, a division of US conglomerate Comcast.  Last year, TikTok's owner ByteDance admitted that four employees had improperly accessed personal data of two journalists from the Financial Times and BuzzFeed. ByteDance said the relevant staff were investigating potential information leaks, and they were fired for misusing their authority to access TikTok user data. Separately, broader concerns have been raised by experts worldwide that TikTok presents a security risk due to the vast troves of data it collects on millions of users, and its vulnerability to potential interference from the Chinese government, which wields considerable influence over businesses in its jurisdiction. Government bans The United States and other Western nations have banned the app on government devices, with the Biden administration threatening to go further by imposing a broader ban unless TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company. A blanket ban would deny 150 million US users access to the platform.  TikTok has repeatedly denied it has links to Beijing, and the company's CEO Shou Chew recently told a US congressional hearing that he'd seen no evidence that the Chinese government had access to user data and had never asked for it. Moreover, he said the amount of information the company collects on users is no more than most industry players. While a number of governments have moved to delete TikTok from their employees' phones, most major news companies are yet to follow. Last month, the BBC advised staff to delete TikTok from their work phones, following a similar move by Danish public broadcaster, DR, but the British broadcaster still publishes its content on the short form video app to millions of followers.  Sky News Australia's Houghton said the decision by the BBC to ban the app yet publish content on the platform was a ""paradox"" that ""proves the hunger for reaching new demographics has perverted editorial strategies in newsrooms globally."" CNN has reached out to the BBC for comment. Before it deleted its account, Houghton said Sky News Australia had 65,000 followers and ""many millions of video views."" The channel is known for its conservative commentary and last year was described in a report by UK think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue as ""an important right-wing outlet with growing influence internationally.""  In relation to the climate crisis, it was also described as ""content hub for influencers, sceptics and outlets across the globe.""  In 2021, YouTube banned Sky News Australia from uploading new content for one week for posting misinformation about the Covid pandemic.  At the time, the broadcaster issued a statement rejecting allegations that its host had denied the existence of Covid-19, and that it had published or removed videos that showed them saying as much. Houghton also argued in an online article that the decision was ""a disturbing attack on the ability to think freely.""",0
473,Did Taylor Swift drop a hint about her breakup from Joe Alwyn?,"Taylor Swift is known for dropping Easter eggs in her work and sharing about her relationships in her music. Some of her fans believe she has done both regarding her breakup after six years with actor Joe Alwyn.  The superstar singer reportedly swapped out her hopeful love song ""Invisible String"" for  ""The 1,"" which talks about someone who was looking for ""the one,"" in her Eras Tour playlist. The change has not gone unnoticed on social media. ""In her last show she replaced invisible string with the one... this is real #taylorswift #joealwyn,"" one person tweeted on April 8.  According to People, Swift made the change late last month during her concert at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Both songs appear on her Grammy winning ""Folklore"" album. Alwyn contributed to the project using the pseudonym ""William Bowery."" The lyrics to ""Invisible String"" reference finding love after heartache. ""Time, mystical time/Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine/Were there clues I didn't see?"" the lyrics read. ""Isn't it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me?"" ""The 1"" is a song about a love that didn't work out. ""But we were something, don't you think so?/Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool/And if my wishes came true/It would've been you,"" Swift sings. ""In my defense, I have none/For never leaving well enough alone/But it would've been fun/If you would've been the one."" CNN has reached out to a representative of Swift for comment.",0

476,Fox News reaches settlement with Venezuelan businessman in election defamation case,"Fox News has settled a defamation lawsuit from a Venezuelan businessman who had accused the network of making false claims about him and the 2020 election, attorneys for the man and Fox News said Saturday in a court filing. The details of the settlement were not made public. ""This matter has been resolved amicably by both sides,"" a Fox News spokesperson said Sunday, declining further comment.  Following the 2020 election, former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs had accused the businessman, Majed Khalil, of playing a key role in supposedly rigging the election against Donald Trump. In a tweet calling the 2020 election a ""cyber Pearl Harbor,"" Dobbs named Khalil as one of four people he wanted his audience to ""get familiar with"" for committing supposed election fraud. Fox News still faces a monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which is set to go to trial in just days. Jury selection for the trial begins Thursday and opening statements are scheduled for April 17, unless the two sides reach a settlement before then. Dominion had sued Fox News for defamation, and says it was defamed by the right-wing network when Fox hosts and guests claimed in 2020 that its voting systems illegally rigged the election against Trump. Fox News has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, maintained it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, and argued that Dominion's lawsuit represents a threat to the First Amendment. While Fox's legal liability will be decided at trial, the case has already battered Fox's reputation. Incriminating texts and emails have shown how Fox executives, hosts and producers didn't believe the claims the network was peddling about Dominion.  The lawsuit is seen as one of the most consequential defamation cases in recent memory.  Fox has argued that a loss will eviscerate press freedoms, and many scholars agree that the bar should remain high to prove defamation.  Other analysts have said holding Fox accountable for knowingly airing lies won't pose a threat to objective journalists who would never do that in the first place.",0
477,ABBA's long-term guitarist Lasse Wellander dies,"ABBA's long-term guitarist Lasse Wellander has died after a short battle with cancer, his family announced.  The Swedish pop group described Wellander's talent as ""immense,"" and paid tribute to a ""dear friend, a fun guy and a superb guitarist.""  ""It is with indescribable sadness that we have to announce that our beloved Lasse has fallen asleep. Lasse recently fell ill in what turned out to be spread cancer and early on Good Friday he passed away, surrounded by his loved ones,"" a statement posted to the guitarist's Facebook page on Sunday said. ""You were an amazing musician and humble as few, but above all you were a wonderful husband, father, brother, uncle and grandfather,"" the statement added.  ""Kind, safe, caring and loving ... and so much more, that cannot be described in words. A hub in our lives, and it's unbelievable that we now have to live on without you.""  ""Lasse was a dear friend, a fun guy and a superb guitarist,"" ABBA said in a statement to CNN Monday. ""The importance of his creative input in the recording studio as well as his rock solid guitar work on stage was immense. ""We mourn his tragic and premature death and remember the kind words, the sense of humour, the smiling face, the musical brilliance of the man who played such an integral role in the ABBA story. He will be deeply missed and never forgotten."" Born in 1952, Wellander did his first session with Swedish pop legends ABBA in October 1974, when songs ""Intermezzo No.1"" and ""Crazy World"" were recorded. Soon after, he became the main guitarist on the group's albums, and toured with them in 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1980, according to the band's website. Even after Anni-Frid ""Frida"" Lyngstad, Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog went their separate ways in 1982, Wellander stayed in the fold, working with Benny and Björn.  He appeared on a number of albums, including the ""Chess"" concept album, two ""Gemini"" albums and the soundtracks for the films ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" as well as the ABBA album ""Voyage,"" released in November 2021. Wellander played with several groups during the 80s, including Low Budget Blues Band, Zkiffz, Little Mike and the Sweet Soul Music Band and Stockholm All Stars, according to the biography on his official website. A celebrated musician in his own right, Wellander released seven studio albums, two of which made the Top 40 album charts, according to his biography on ABBA's website. He received the Albin Hagström Memorial Award from The Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 2005 and 13 years later was awarded the Swedish Musicians Union's prestigious special prize Studioräven Award for his work as a session musician.",0
478,'Succession' delivers a major surprise as the show goes back to its future,"In one astonishing turn, ""Succession"" took its audience back to where the show began five years ago, and indeed, the very roots of its title. The Emmy-winning HBO show kicked off, after all, with a media empire being thrown into chaos when its imperious leader fell ill, leaving his children and underlings to jockey over how to replace him, and to contemplate if anyone possibly could. The very title dealt with that scenario, while the intervening seasons have reinforced the sense that in terms of corporate savvy and grit, the apples can fall pretty far from the tree. The power of Brian Cox's performance as that mogul, Logan Roy, made him seem practically immortal, the occasional infirmities of his age notwithstanding. But in one off-screen moment, Logan was gone, in the most protracted and painful fashion imaginable, leaving his stunned offspring to weakly try to say goodbye over the phone, and then grapple along with his subordinates with the implications of what his death would mean. Series creator Jesse Armstrong didn't grant Logan much dignity in death, as he collapsed in the bathroom aboard a private jet on a mission to salvage his big-money merger with GoJo. In hindsight, he also telegraphed the character's fate in the opening hour, as Logan mused about the prospect of an afterlife, concluding that while nobody can know, this is probably all that there is. Logan certainly lived his life that way, and his demise was preceded by a scene that underscored his ruthlessness and cruelty, tasking his son Roman (Kieran Culkin) with firing longtime employee Gerri (J. Smith Cameron), despite the elder Roy's knowledge that the two had an unusually close (if somewhat unorthodox) relationship.  The kids, meanwhile, went through a series of reactions, both emotional and pragmatic. Not everyone, after all, has to worry about how their father's death is going to influence the financial markets and potentially tank their company's stock price, costing them millions of dollars as collateral damage. As an added bonus, the younger Roys had broken with their father, competing against him for the acquisition of Pierce Global Media, adding to the intense discomfort and obvious mixed feelings as those scenes played out. ""We're not estranged,"" Kendall (Jeremy Strong) insisted, despite evidence to the contrary, while his sister Shiv (Sarah Snook) practically pleaded to her unconscious dad over the phone, ""Don't go, please, not now."" The one note of semi-normalcy within the hour came from an unlikely source: Elder brother Connor (Alan Ruck) and his bride-to-be Willa (Justin Lupe), who decided to go through with their wedding, a surprisingly human choice given his plans to use the occasion as a tool to prop up his polling-under-one-percent presidential campaign. The other Roy children, meanwhile, seemed to derive a degree of strength from each other, with Kendall and Roman seeking to reassure themselves by saying, sardonically, ""You're not gonna be OK."" ""Succession"" has confounded expectations by throwing in this twist so early in the final season, but in hindsight, this was always where things were logically heading, with what amounts to a royal succession and what happens after the king dies without a clear heir. Cox will surely be missed over the remaining hours (barring flashbacks of some kind). Yet in terms of setting up dramatic (and comedic) possibilities around the deal-making, scheming and family dynamics to come, the show is coming back to where it all started, in a way that appears destined to be more than OK.",0
479,"Michael Lerner, 'Barton Fink' and 'Elf' actor, dead at 81","Michael Lerner, a veteran character actor who received an Oscar nomination for his performance as an overbearing studio head in the 1991 film ""Barton Fink,"" has died, his nephew, actor Sam Lerner, announced in a post on social media. He was 81. ""We lost a legend last night,"" Sam Lerner wrote on Instagram Sunday. ""It's hard to put into words how brilliant my uncle Michael was, and how influential he was to me. His stories always inspired me and made me fall in love with acting. He was the coolest, most confident, talented guy, and the fact that he was my blood will always make me feel special. Everyone that knows him knows how insane he was— in the best way. I'm so lucky I got to spend so much time with him, and we're all lucky we can continue to watch his work for the rest of time. RIP Michael, enjoy your unlimited Cuban cigars, comfy chairs, and endless movie marathon."" No further details on Lerner's death were given. CNN has reached out to representatives for Michael and Sam Lerner for further comment. Michael Lerner was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1941 and studied drama at Brooklyn College. He later earned a Fulbright scholarship and spent two years in London before he was invited to join the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. He was discovered by an agent in San Francisco who brought him down to Los Angeles where his Hollywood career began.  With film and television credits dating back to the 1960's, Lerner's career in Hollywood spanned decades. His earliest work throughout the '60's and '70's included appearances on television shows like ""The Doris Day Show,"" ""The Bob Newhart Show"" and ""M*A*S*H.""  His first film came in 1970 as the character Leo in ""Alex in Wonderland"" alongside Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn. Lerner went on to appear in films such as ""The Ski Bum,"" ""The Candidate,"" and ""Outlaw Blues.""  The actor appeared in multiple episodes of ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Melba"" in the mid '80s before he starred in ""Barton Fink"" in 1991. His performance as studio executive Jack Lipnick, for which he starred alongside John Turturro, John Goodman and Judy Davis, earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.  ""I read the script, and you just know good writing. It was brilliantly written, and I just knew it,"" Lerner said in 2016 of the ""Barton Fink"" script, adding that during his audition in front of directors Joel and Ethan Coen, ""I did the monologue the way I wanted to do it and I just walked of the room and that was it. And Joel and Ethan were just sitting in a corner just laughing and laughing and that was it."" In 1995, Lerner starred in the CBS drama ""Courthouse"" as Judge Myron Winkleman, which lasted for one season. He went on to play Cher Horowitz's dad Mel Horowitz for one season in the 1996 ""Clueless"" television series inspired by the hugely successful film of the same name starring Alicia Silverstone.  Throughout the aughts and 2010's, Lerner appeared as Fulton in the holiday classic ""Elf"" alongside Will Farrell, and in TV shows like ""Law and Order: SVU,"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""Glee.""",0

481,Brandon Lee's loved ones remember 'The Crow' star 30 years after his death,"To quote one profiler's words back in 1992, he was ""the hunky heir."" Brandon Lee's athleticism made him a natural fit for the martial arts-forward roles that got his foot in Hollywood's door and the perfect person to take up the mantle left by his legendary father Bruce Lee's death.  But there are a lot of Brandon Lees the world didn't get to meet before an accident on the set of his movie ""The Crow"" took his life a little more than 30 years ago.  There was the Brandon who physically dispatched a burglar whom he caught in his own home and held down until police arrived to apprehend the crook.   The Brandon who, as the president of his high school senior class, staged a rebellion of sorts during which he urged his classmates not to take school seriously. He was expelled.  The Brandon who had his eye on a pretty girl he met while taking a meeting at a production company, charmed her with his faux arrogance and later shared a first kiss at the company Christmas party. He would go on to ask for her hand in marriage.  ""Brandon's personality led him to being a 'character' in everything he did,"" his mother, Linda Lee Cadwell, told CNN.   Brandon Bruce Lee was a brother, son, fiancé, friend, hopeless romantic, literary savant, lover of animals, avid reader, prolific storyteller and talented actor on his way to becoming a bona fide movie star. Then he was accidentally shot and killed by a jammed prop gun in March 1993. He was only 28.  He's now been gone longer than he was alive. But those who knew him -- the whole, complicated him and the man he eagerly wanted moviegoers to become better acquainted with through his work -- know their memories of Brandon are as formidable as he was. Like his father, his loved ones say, he was too big of a mind and spirit to be contained in something as fleeting as time.  ""My brother's fearlessness and his sense of adventure and freedom, his inherent artistry and creativity, and his desire for learning and growth all came from the time that he spent with my father,"" Shannon Lee told CNN in an interview. ""My father was my brother's hero."" A father's influence Bruce Lee delighted in sharing martial arts with his son, Cadwell remembers, sharing her memories in a statement to CNN.  Brandon spoke often about his father's training in his early interviews, proud that he'd gotten years of study under him and at the same time, deeply saddened that it was cut short.  Brandon was just eight years old when his father died from cerebral edema in 1973, mere months after the release of ""Enter the Dragon"" turned him into a global icon. He was 32.  His mother described Brandon as ""terribly hurt"" when Bruce Lee died, and it took some time for Brandon to pick the art back up.  After spending parts of his childhood in Hong Kong, where many of his father's movies were filmed, Brandon fluently spoke Cantonese and had to readjust to speaking English when Cadwell relocated the family to Seattle following Bruce Lee's death. After a year in the Pacific Northwest, the Lees settled in Los Angeles, hoping for a fresh start.  When he was a teenager, with the help of Danny Inosanto, Bruce Lee's protégé, Brandon began training again, eventually becoming proficient in his father's style, Jeet Kune Do (""the way of the intercepting fist"").  Soon, Brandon was back on track to pursue his lifelong dream of acting. ""I've always wanted to be an actor,"" Brandon said in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen in 1992. ""I never wanted to do anything else even when I was in elementary school."" Brandon's first acting credit came in 1986 when he starred in ""Kung Fu: The Movie."" He went on to star in ""Legacy of Rage,"" a traditional Hong Kong-style action film, and later starred alongside Ernest Borgnine in the action film ""Laser Mission"" in 1989.  In the early '90s, Brandon starred in action movies ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" and ""Rapid Fire."" He often drew comparisons to action stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean Claude Van Damme, and, most frequently, his father.  Cadwell said she had many conversations with Brandon about the expectations put upon him as Bruce Lee's son. But Brandon's goal, she said, was always to ""be his own man.""  ""Brandon was so much like his father in that he thought long and deeply about his passions,"" Cadwell said.  Bruce Lee used to say that he was a martial artist first and an actor second, Cadwell remembers. Brandon would say the opposite. ""I firmly believe that my father would not have wanted his life to be a problem to me,"" Brandon also told the Ottawa Citizen in 1992. ""If I had a son, I would want to be a benefit, not a burden.""  Being a father himself is something Brandon was looking forward to experiencing with his fiancée Eliza Hutton, his sister said.  Hutton, the aforementioned production company employee who he became smitten with and took to a Melissa Etheridge concert on one of their first dates, says ""there were so many things to love about him.""  ""He was genuine, charming, highly intelligent, insightful, moral, fearless, romantic, and hilarious—all wrapped up in drop-dead gorgeousness,"" Hutton told CNN in an email exchange.  After an ""unforgettable"" proposal in Venice, Italy, Hutton and Brandon were set to marry just weeks after he was supposed to have completed filming ""The Crow.""  ""Brandon was a gifted and dedicated writer, actor and athlete with a sensitive soul who was wrongly taken from us too soon,"" Hutton said. ""No matter how deep the pain I've endured in losing him, I wouldn't trade our time together.""  Her memories of their time together read like pages ripped from a romance novel. These days, she says, ""I am reminded of Brandon in all things true, beautiful and strong.""  A rising star ""The Crow"" was set to be Brandon's doorway to bigger opportunities.  A noir supernatural thriller based on James O'Barr's graphic novel of the same name, Brandon played Eric Draven, a rock and roll guitarist who is summoned by a mysterious crow to rise from the dead and seek justice for murdering Draven and his fiancée Shelly (Sofia Shinas) on the eve of their Halloween wedding. The Alex Proyas-directed film had an estimated $23 million budget and was produced by Miramax. O'Barr, along with David J. Schow and John Shirley, wrote the script.  After the film, Brandon was ready and willing to work for opportunities that would allow him to stretch other muscles -- especially ones that didn't necessarily show off his physical skills.   It's not hard for Shannon Lee to imagine her brother starring in movies of today like ""The Matrix"" or ""Gladiator,"" but she also said he had the range to handle a major dramatic role akin to Adam Driver's performance in the 2019 romantic drama ""Marriage Story.""  ""He would have loved the opportunity to stretch and do dramatic roles,"" Shannon Lee said. He even auditioned for ""Say Anything,"" the 1989 rom-com starring John Cusack. It was a role he really wanted.  He quickly learned that as a matter of pragmatism, Shannon Lee said, he had to use his martial arts skills and his name to get his foot in the door -- or, rather, to kick the door down.  The tides turned when ""Rapid Fire"" came out in 1992. Shannon Lee was her brother's assistant on the movie and remembers him finally starting to feel hopeful that he was on his way to stepping outside of his father's shadow. By many accounts, ""The Crow"" was a film that Brandon was immensely excited about, and he was having the time of his life.  Jeff Most, a co-producer of the movie, told CNN in an interview that Brandon's ""brilliant"" notes about the script added to the film's emotional depth amid the physical brutality.  ""We really tailored the role and much of the world to Brandon's vision,"" he said.  He added: ""Obviously this role of Eric Draven showed the world how great an actor, truly great of an actor he was and what he would have gone on to do. I think the fact that we have this from him is just a blessing and it's a gift."" It was not uncommon for the bookish Brandon -- a walking dictionary, according to Shannon Lee -- to call upon his vast literary knowledge to inform his decisions on screen. In an interview in support of ""The Crow,"" he described his character by quoting a line from Paul Bowles 1949 novel ""The Sheltering Sky.""  ""Because we do not know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well,"" he quoted.  This, he said ""is the point of view that this character is coming from in the whole film, because it has been brought sharply into focus for him how precious each moment of his life is."" The movie was filming when he turned 28, and when Shannon Lee called to wish her brother a happy birthday, he told her that he was having an ""amazing"" day because he was ""doing the thing that I love most in the world.""  A tragic end The night before Brandon died, he called his mother.  ""He was so happy that that night would be the last of the scenes that involved weapons,"" Cadwell said. ""He was so looking forward to his next project, which was to be a film that did not include any martial arts. I felt so happy for him that he had reached his goal of being signed as a serious dramatic actor.""  While filming the final scenes of ""The Crow,"" Brandon was accidentally shot and killed when actor Michael Massee, who played drug dealer Funboy in the film, fired at Lee during a scene with a prop gun that was later found to have been improperly loaded.  Hit in the abdomen, Brandon died hours later in a nearby North Carolina hospital. Massee died in 2016. In their hearts, the Lee family and Hutton knew that Brandon would've wanted the movie to be completed and released, Shannon Lee recalls, knowing how proud he was of his work and his excitement for the opportunity. Looking back, she says ""it would have seemed really unfair for him not to get to share that with the world."" Brandon's remaining scenes were filmed using his stunt double, Chad Stahelski, who went on to direct the ""John Wick"" movies. When the film was eventually released in 1994, it went on to gross over $50 million worldwide at the box office.  Most said that he has been committed to not using practical firearms on his sets since Brandon died in 1993.  On-set accidents before and since Brandon's have brought forth renewed calls for tighter safety measures to be taken on TV and movie sets.  The call for action happened again in the wake of the death of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who was accidentally shot and killed by a prop gun held by actor Alec Baldwin on the ""Rust"" film set.  Shannon Lee, speaking, she says, as somebody who has been ""spiritually, mortally and soulfully wounded by these sets of circumstances,"" commented that 30 years later, she doesn't see why practical firearms are used on sets at all these days when special effects are safer and can be more cost effective.  ""There is no reason to harm another human life, one human life should be enough,"" sh",0
482,Shania Twain wants more diversity in country music. Here's who she's talking about,"""Diversity"" is not a dirty word. One of the greatest things about this world -- or, at least, it should be -- is that we are not all the same. That's something Shania Twain, a queen in country music, clearly appreciates when she recently called on the genre to expand and feature new voices. Luckily, that's just what is happening. Something to sip on... During her recent acceptance speech for the Equal Play Award at the 2023 CMT Music Awards, Twain issued a call for more equity and diversity in the country music industry. She even showed them how it's done. Twain presented an award with The BoykinZ, a quartet of Black singing sisters who broke through on TikTok belting out country music. The artists recently crossed paths on ""The Kelly Clarkson Show.""  ""I invited them to do a little acappella piece with me tonight, just as part of my exchange of supporting upcoming young female artists, people that might, in this day and age, be excluded,"" Twain told People about the group on the CMT Awards red carpet.  When she heads out on her global arena tour later this month, Twain will be joined by a varied group of performers, including singers Breland and Mickey Guyton, the latter who has become one of the most high-profile Black singers in country music and one of the talent scouts on a new Apple TV+ music competition show, ""My Kind of Country."" And inclusiveness isn't just black and white. T.J. Osborne, one half of the Grammy-winning duo Brothers Osborne with his brother John, shared publicly in 2021 that he is gay. The LGBTQ representation in country music has increased with artists like Orville Peck, Lil Nas X and Brandi Carlile, all who are walking the trail blazed by artists like Chely Wright and the group Lavender Country.  It's great to see space being made and held for diverse artists in country music. One thing to talk about... I recently interviewed Teyana Taylor about her powerful performance in the new film ""A Thousand and One,"" which won the prestigious grand jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. But there's another role she has coming up that also has me super excited as Dionne Warwick in a forthcoming biopic. Anyone who watched the CNN documentary about Warwick knows how incredible she is as a performer and a person. Having met Taylor, I can tell you that she not only physically resembles Warwick, but she is also dynamic like the legendary performer and, of course, she can sing. ""We're very close. I talk to her and her son often,"" Taylor told me. ""It's really exciting. That was another dream of mine, to be able to sit next to the person that I get to play and just love on them."" In my interview with Warwick last year, she spoke highly of Taylor, and I am saying a little prayer this project debuts soon. You should listen to... This week's newsletter is heavy with people I have interviewed because, professionally, I try to get around. Back in 2021, I chatted with actor Justin Long and his brother Christian about a film they made, ""Lady of the Manor."" They were a hoot, and you don't have to take my word for it. ""Life is Short with Justin Long"" is a podcast in which the brothers talk to folks who fascinate them -- from actors to deep thinkers. In one of the most recent episodes, we even learn about Long's engagement to actress Kate Bosworth.  The Wondery podcast is available via various streaming services.  Cannot wait to watch... ""My Name Is Mo'Nique"" It's safe to safe to say that Mo'Nique and Netflix have settled their differences. The comedian and Oscar-winning actress had sued the streaming service in 2019 for alleged pay discrimination.  That case was settled and now her comedy special, ""My Name is Mo'Nique"" is streaming on Netflix. Expect it to be as raw and irreverent as the woman who does not shy away from speaking her mind. ""Beef"" Sign me up for anything starring Steven Yeun and Ali Wong.  They star as two people who almost collide while driving in a parking lot and the result is an intriguing dramedy. Satire rooted in road rage? If anyone could pull it off it's Yeun and Wong. I'm in for the ride!",0
483,Jeremy Renner sees a 'lucky man' when he looks in the mirror these days,"Jeremy Renner sat down with Diane Sawyer for his first interview since being crushed by a snow plow he was operating on New Year's Day. The Marvel star was the subject of ""Jeremy Renner: The Diane Sawyer Interview -- A Story of Terror, Survival and Triumph,"" which detailed the accident at his Nevada home and Renner's recovery. Here's some of what we  learned: Saving his nephew It had been reported that Renner was attempting to save his adult nephew, Alex, when the accident occurred and the actor shared during the interview exactly what happened. According to Renner, the pair had towed a vehicle out of the snow using the snow plow when it began to slide on the ice. Out of concern for his nephew's safety, Renner stuck his foot out of the plow to look back at Alex and fell out of the cab. Because he had forgotten to put the parking  brake on, the actor was pulled under the moving plow, which weighs more than 14,000 pounds. ""You shouldn't be outside the vehicle when you're operating it, you know what I mean,"" Renner recounted. ""It's like driving a car with one foot out of the car."" Noting that the accident was ""my mistake and I paid for it,"" the ""Hawkeye"" star said he screamed, ""Not today, motherf---er!"" as he was being sucked under the plow.  Despite the accident which left him severely injured, Renner has no regrets. ""Yeah, I'd do it again because it was going right at my nephew,"" he said. The devastation  Renner's injuries included eight ribs broken in 14 places, a broken eye socket, broken knee, a collapsed lung and his liver pierced from a rib bone. His neighbors Rich Kovach and Barb Fletcher assisted Renner's nephew in helping him after the accident. Both spoke of the trauma during the interview. ""It was a horrible sound to listen to someone, just literally watching somebody die in front of you,"" Fletcher said. ""You feel so helpless."" Kovach said there was a great deal of blood involved in the accident and ""when I looked at his head, it appeared to me to be cracked wide open."" Fletcher said she believes Renner may have died at some point. ""I really feel he did pass away for a couple of seconds,"" she said. ""I really do."" His recuperation  Renner was eventually airlifted to a hospital in Reno, Nevada. His doctors believe Renner being in going shape prior to the accident assisted in both his survival and recovery, but it was extremely touch and go. So much so that Renner said he was making end of life plans for himself.  ""I'm writing down notes in my phone... last words to my family,"" he told Sawyer. ""Don't let me live on tubes on a machine, if my existence is going to be on drugs and painkillers. Let me go now."" These days, he has progressed to the point where he is able to walk with a cane and the actor is feeling grateful for his survival. When he looks in the mirror now, Renner said, ""I see a lucky man.""",0
484,How a trio of ProPublica reporters landed an explosive story on Justice Clarence Thomas,"It all started with a little curiosity. A team of ProPublica reporters earlier this year began looking into the travel of various Supreme Court justices, not entirely sure what they would find, if anything. But after a little digging, the trio of journalists stumbled upon something that piqued their interest.  In fact, what they uncovered raised their eyebrows to such a degree that they believed the discovery was an explosive story in its own right: a trip that Clarence Thomas had taken aboard billionaire Harlan Crow's private jet between Connecticut and Washington, D.C. But their editors encouraged the team to keep working the story, Justin Elliott, a member of the reporting team, told me by phone on Thursday. ""So we started grinding,"" Elliot explained. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. From there, the story quickly grew in size and scope. ""It snowballed,"" Elliott said. Elliot and his co-authors, Joshua Kaplan and Alex Mierjeski, assembled a spreadsheet comprised of hundreds of people, methodically contacting potential sources as they built the story. ""The progress was gratifyingly steady,"" Elliot told me, cautioning, however, that ""it was not easy."" Easy or not, the final product that published on Thursday morning was unquestionably worth the effort. The bombshell report included stunning details that accuse Thomas of having accepted ultra-luxury vacations and private jet travel from a Republican mega-donor for decades. Even worse? ""These trips appeared nowhere on Thomas' financial disclosures,"" the ProPublica team wrote. ""His failure to report the flights appears to violate a law passed after Watergate that requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to disclose most gifts, two ethics law experts said."" The story landed with a bang, shaking the political world and immediately eliciting statements of serious concern from legal experts and Washington lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said in a statement that the report was ""a call to action."" Durbin added that ""the Senate Judiciary Committee will act."" What ultimately happens remains to be seen. But the immense fallout has already underscored the importance of journalism produced by non-profit newsrooms like ProPublica.  ""From my perspective as a reporter,"" Elliott told me, ""I feel so lucky to have the reporting resources and time resources to do a heavy lift like this. There are not that many places where you can do that anymore. So we are grateful to have jobs at ProPublica. ""If there are any rich people reading,"" Elliott added, ""give your money to nonprofit journalism.""",0

486,'Ted Lasso' pays tribute to Grant Wahl in new episode,"Longtime soccer journalist Grant Wahl played a significant role in shaping ""Ted Lasso."" In the most recent episode, the show honored his impact. At the end of episode four of Season 3, titled ""Big Week,"" the line ""In memory of Grant Wahl"" appears on the screen as the credits begin to roll. Earlier in the episode, Brendan Hunt, who plays Coach Beard, is seen holding Wahl's book ""The Beckham Experiment,"" analyzing David Beckham's move from Europe to Major League Soccer. Wahl collapsed and died last year while covering the World Cup in Qatar, due to what was later revealed to be a ruptured aortic aneurysm.  Dr. Céline Gounder, Wahl's widow, posted about the episode on Twitter, thanking the ""Ted Lasso"" team for the remembrance. ""This episode means so much to me and my family,"" she wrote.  Hunt, also an executive producer for the show, said Wahl played a huge role in developing the character of Trent Crimm, a journalist who spends Season 3 shadowing the fictional AFC Richmond club for a book he's writing.  Wahl covered the LA Galaxy, the team Beckham joined when he moved to the US, in a similar way -- and they thought of his book immediately to use as an Easter egg in the show, Hunt said in a statement to CNN. ""We exchanged emails about his experience and he was extremely generous with his answers to our questions,"" Hunt said. ""Grant's death happened while we were in post-production, and it was pretty self-evident that we would commemorate him in some way; the episode where his book is shown seemed the most organic place for it ..."" he continued. ""His death remains jarring and tragic. He will forever be missed."" Wahl was a preeminent soccer journalist who spent years covering the sport in the US at a time when soccer was only on the periphery of most Americans' consciousness.  ""He was almost a missionary in that sense,"" British football commentator Jon Champion previously told CNN. ""He would travel around the globe, telling people to take American soccer seriously. If you ask any of the frontline European football journalists who their first port of call has been if they wanted a story in America, it would be Grant Wahl.""  Wahl was also an early fan of ""Ted Lasso,"" interviewing the cast for his podcast in 2020 and visiting Hunt in Richmond last year.  ""Ted Lasso"" has since become a hit for Apple TV+, winning multiple Emmy awards and becoming one of the top shows from the streamer. Just last month, the cast even met with President Joe Biden to discuss mental health.",0
487,Chloe Bailey on the blessing of 'Praise This',"Chloe Bailey is feeling blessed by her latest project, ""Praise This."" In the new film, Bailey plays Sam, an aspiring, young singer who must join her cousin's struggling, praise team in the lead-up to a national competition. The role feels tailor-made for Bailey, one half of the sibling singing duo Chlöe x Halle. ""It's my first movie I've stared in, so to be able to do it with my love of music and God all combined, it's s been pretty cool and I'm so grateful,"" Bailey told CNN. The ""Grown-ish"" star recently stirred conversation for her appearance the Prime drama ""Swarm."" But her latest role finds Bailey in a film centered in a message of faith. Producer Will Packer told CNN he viewed this project similarly to his 2007 film, ""Stomp The Yard."" ""'Stomp the Yard,' while masquerading as a dance movie, was really about telling the story of Black colleges and fraternity and sororities at Black colleges, which was a world I knew well,"" he said. ""I have an affinity for the church and faith-based stories. Whether you're somebody that doesn't even know praise teams exist, I wanted to draw you into this world and then tell this story of a young girl who's trying to find her voice, who's trying to find her connection with her spirituality when she feels like she's lost."" Packer said he had Bailey in mind for the lead role from the start. ""She reminds me of Beyoncé. And by that I mean, not in the ways that other people have compared and other people think about, you know, her and Beyoncé as singers and actresses,"" he explained. ""I mean in terms of her work ethic. Chloe works very hard. You're not gonna outwork her."" That makes sense given that Bailey and her sister, who is set to star in the live-action ""Little Mermaid"" film being released in May,"" are protégés of Beyoncé. Anjelika Washington, who costars in ""Praise This"" as Sam's ""sister cousin"" Jess, told CNN she hopes the film will inspire audiences to be kind to one another. ""I hope that people remember to just love people,"" Washington said. ""That's the greatest command of all, so I hope that people have an open mind for everything."" Bailey agreed. ""I truly believe that God accepts us in every shape and form, and we should come exactly as we are,"" Bailey said. ""(The movie) shows that in such a positive light with comedy, and I hope audiences love it.""  Director Tina Gordon also has high hopes for ""Praise This"" and other projects like it.  ""I'm hoping that family-based projects, faith-based projects have a bigger and bigger home in Hollywood,"" she said. ""I actually think community is very important and entertainment that sort of fosters family, that multi-generations can watch together. We definitely learned that people want that over the last couple years."" ""Praise This"" also costars Druski, along with Grammy-nominated artists Quavo and Tristan Mack Wilds.  ""Praise This"" debuts on April 7 streams on Peacock.",0
488,Indian journalists warn of new government assault on press freedom,"India's government is planning to create a state fact-checking unit with the power to order social media platforms to take down content about its activities that it deems ""fake or misleading.""  In an amendment to rules covering digital and social media published Thursday, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said that the fact-checking would apply to information about ""any business of the central government"" on social media platforms.  The Editors Guild of India, a nonprofit organization representing more than 200 journalists, said in a statement on Friday that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the new rules, saying they had ""deeply adverse implications"" for press freedom in India. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a minister in the IT ministry, told Indian news agency ANI on Friday that the updated rules did not represent ""censoring at all,"" and that social media companies could choose to continue to share content that fell foul of the fact-checking process, but there would be consequences if they did.  If these companies failed to take down the offending content, Chandrasekhar said, they would lose the automatic legal protection they currently enjoy against complaints about third-party content on their platforms. That would open up the possibility for aggrieved parties, including government ministries, to take them to court.  ""The dangers of misinformation, the impact of patently false information in a democracy like ours, is never to be underestimated,"" Chandrasekhar said.  'Absolute power'  The Editors Guild expressed alarm that there was no mention in the rules of ""what will be the governing mechanism for such a fact-checking unit, the judicial oversight, [or] the right to appeal.""   ""In effect, the government has given itself absolute power to determine what is fake or not, in respect of its own work, and order take down,"" the guild added. It urged the government to withdraw the rule change and consult with media organizations. Twitter and Facebook, which both have a significant presence in India, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Concern has been brewing in recent months over the Indian government's increasingly restrictive stance towards the media.  In February, Indian tax authorities searched the BBC's offices in Delhi and Mumbai, accusing the British broadcaster of tax evasion. The incident came nearly a month after the government used emergency powers to block the release of a documentary about Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Modi has been accused of silencing his critics in recent months. A senior member of India's opposition Congress party was arrested in February for allegedly insulting the prime minister.  And last month, the former leader of the party — Rahul Gandhi — was disqualified as a lawmaker after a court found him guilty of defamation. He was convicted over a speech he made in 2019, in which he referred to thieves as having the same surname as Modi.",0
489,Molly Shannon's most laugh-out-loud moments on 'SNL',"Molly Shannon is so excited to return to ""Saturday Night Live,"" she showed up three days early. In anticipation of her hosting gig this Saturday, she asks in a promotional clip, ""Where is everyone?"" A crew member replies, ""They don't come in until Saturday."" ""It's OK. I'm just gonna wait back here for the next few days so I'm ready for the big show,"" Shannon, who was a main cast member on ""SNL"" from 1995 to 2001, replies. She also returned to host in 2007. Shannon has gone on to star in ""Other People,"" ""The White Lotus,"" and ""Divorce,"" among many other roles. But fans of the actress and comedian remember her time at ""SNL"" well. Here are five of Shannon's iconic characters we can't forget.  Mary Katherine Gallagher Shannon's Mary Katherine is a teenage Catholic school girl who swings between hyperactive and shy, but ultimately knows she's a ""superstar."" The time she competes in a sing-off with Whitney Houston is classic. Mary Katherine was the star of the 1999 movie ""Superstar,"" starring Shannon and Will Ferrell. Sally O'Malley Shannon's Sally O'Malley is ""50 years old!"" She can stretch and kick and shimmy and kick again. The time she tries out for the Rockettes wearing her signature red two-piece and her animal print purse is a classic.  ""When do I start?"" she asks.  ""The Courtney Love Show"" Shannon was brilliant as retro Courtney Love, complete with a silk nightgown and a messy blonde wig in a sketch called ""The Courtney Love Show,"" where she would interview celebrities but would have to lay down when she felt tired. Terry Rialto on NPR In ""The Delicious Dish,"" Shannon played a smooth-voiced radio food show host with Ana Gasteyer. The two would innocently use risqué double entendres without realizing they weren't really describing food. Southern Gals Shannon is fantastic as a Southern woman who is visiting New York with her girlfriends. She's thrilled by ""the lady in Times Square"" who brushed her hair then ""squatted down to take a little pee."" She describes seeing ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, but likes the movie better. When a rat sits on her shoulder in a pizza place, she charmingly says, ""It looks like I made a little friend."" Shannon hosts ""SNL"" April 8.",0
490,'Beef' turns a road-rage run-in into one of the year's juiciest shows,"Netflix makes an early bid for the year's juiciest new series with ""Beef,"" a twisty, dark and stellar showcase for Steven Yeun and Ali Wong in which the escalating fallout from a road-rage encounter spirals out of control. Disarmingly funny and increasingly nasty, it should make everyone think twice before honking at that idiot stranger who just pulled out in front of you. That's where it all begins for Danny Cho (""The Walking Dead's"" Yeun), a struggling contractor working with his unambitious brother Paul (Young Mazino), after he nearly backs into Amy Lau (Ali Wong, impressively flexing her dramatic acting chops after a standup career, including the recent ""Paper Girls""), a successful yuppie entrepreneur and mom on the verge of cashing in by selling her company to a wealthy art snob (Maria Bello). One pointedly extended finger later, the chase is on, leaving both Danny and Amy eager to settle the score, prompting a game of tit-for-tat that gradually begins to inflict pretty significant collateral damage on those around them, including Amy's husband George (Joseph Lee), who is somehow oblivious to the simmering anger that his wife carries around inside her. Series creator Lee Sung Jin has worked predominantly in sitcoms, which explains the darkly comic streak that runs through many of the situations. But the weird turns definitely have a dramatic side, which makes ""Beef"" as hard to characterize as it is to stop watching. Part of that has to do with the deft way the series peels back layers regarding the key players and their relationships, including past actions that have major consequences in terms of the pivotal conflict. Those sequences help explain the chips on their shoulders that might lead Amy and Danny to risk so much on a seemingly pointless feud. The fact that the series features a predominantly Asian-American cast is easily overlooked given the device that sets it all in motion, but show effortlessly weaves elements of cultural specificity into the proceedings, including Danny's sudden and not-too-convincing interest in the Korean church, and the pressure he feels regarding his obligations to his parents as well as his brother. Perhaps foremost, ""Beef"" organically advances the story in a way that carefully builds in absurdity as the bad choices and retaliation pile up upon each other. It's also that rare streaming series that doesn't feel as if it's straining or vamping to flesh out 10 episodes. The simplicity of the premise, in that sense, belies how intricately it all unfolds. Danny and Amy might not appear to have in common, but they share a hidden bond in their seemingly inexhaustible supply of pettiness and hostility. ""Beef"" takes that dynamic, marinates in it, and somehow serves up a four-star meal. ""Beef"" premieres April 6 on Netflix.",0
491,'Unstable' unleashes Rob Lowe in an uninspired father-son Netflix comedy,"It's nice to see families working together, even in the jaded confines of Hollywood. But ""Unstable"" plays a little too conspicuously like a father-and-son bonding opportunity for Rob Lowe and John Owen Lowe, yielding a breezy Netflix comedy series that's so lightweight it could easily just blow away. The origins of the show actually grew out of the younger Lowe trolling his famous dad via social media, prompting the producers (of which Rob Lowe is one) to look for a showcase to exploit that dynamic. The not-terribly-original result casts the elder Lowe as Ellis Dragon, a wealthy biotech entrepreneur who goes from ""eccentric"" to ""off the deep end"" after the death of his wife. Worried that Ellis' behavior might imperil the company, the company's management -- lead by buttoned-up chief financial officer Anna (Sian Clifford) -- enlist his son, Jackson, to come work for him, hoping that having the kid around will provide a stabilizing (hence the title) influence. Yet Jackson has headed off on his own for a reason, seeking to escape his dad's sizable shadow. As developed by Victor Fresco (a veteran sitcom writer whose credits include ""Santa Clarita Diet"" and ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe""), once you get past the family part of the premise ""Unstable"" becomes a sort-of variation on ""30 Rock,"" with a lot of outlandish talent that needs to be coddled in order to keep the place running. The dynamic almost immediately includes a romantic triangle built around Jackson, who draws the attention of two genius lab workers, Ruby (Emma Ferreira) and Luna (Rachel Marsh), the first overt about her interest in him, the latter shyly hiding behind her glasses and a boyfriend that she doesn't actually like all that much. There's actually a sweetness if a little too much familiarity around those situations, but beyond the obvious hook of allowing Lowe to completely unleash his silly side (see the ""Austin Powers"" movies), the series veers into cartoon-character territory with the board members who are out to dethrone Ellis and a therapist (Fred Armisen) who gets sucked into his outlandish orbit. Granted, there's something to be said for a comedy that doesn't aspire to much more than being funny, and while John Owen Lowe (who previously appeared with his dad in the A&E unscripted series ""The Lowe Files"") holds his own in terms of dashing off one-liners, this is hardly the first example of a Hollywood production motivated by take-your-child-to-work-day underpinnings. ""Unstable"" isn't bad, in that context, but the ""un"" that most comes to mind actually goes with ""necessary."" ""Unstable"" premieres March 30 on Netflix.",0
492,"'The Little Mermaid' remake updates original lyrics to include consent, songwriter says","The live action remake of ""The Little Mermaid"" will have updated lyrics to include consent, the songwriter has said. The classic Disney movie, originally released as an animation in 1989, has been updated to reflect changing social attitudes towards consent, according to composer Alan Menken, who wrote the soundtrack to the original movie with Howard Ashman. Songs ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" will include new lyrics to reflect this shift. Menken collaborated with American songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda on the live-action remake, which will premiere next month. ""There are some lyric changes in 'Kiss the Girl' because people have gotten very sensitive about the idea that [Prince Eric] would, in any way, force himself on [Ariel],"" Menken said in an interview with Vanity Fair last week. In the movie, Ariel makes a deal with sea witch Ursula to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can explore the world above water and impress Prince Eric. In the animated classic, Ariel must secure the kiss of ""true love"" within three days, or else she transforms back into a mermaid and will belong to Ursula. The song's lyrics urge Prince Eric to kiss Ariel before it's too late.  In the original lyrics to ""Kiss the Girl,"" Sebastian, Ariel's crab pal, sings: ""Yes, you want her. Look at her, you know you do. Possible she wants you, too. There is one way to ask her. It don't take a word. Not a single word. Go on and kiss the girl."" ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" has also been revised, Menken said, because the original contained ""lines that might make young girls somehow feel that they shouldn't speak out of turn, even though Ursula is clearly manipulating Ariel to give up her voice."" ""The men up there don't like a lot of blabber. They think a girl who gossips is a bore,"" sings Ursula in the original track. ""Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word. And after all, what is idle babble for?"" Ursula advises Ariel: ""It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man."" The new lyrics to the songs have not yet been revealed. The remake directed by Rob Marshall and is set to premiere in theaters on May 26. It features Halle Bailey as Ariel, Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric and Javier Bardem as King Triton.",0
493,Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars files lawsuit against band after touring dispute,"Mick Mars, guitarist for the 1980's heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the band that he was a part of for four decades. Mars is requesting that seven corporate entities associated with Mötley Crüe hand over records related to their business dealings following a 2022 dispute stemming from Mars notifying the band that he'd be retiring from touring due to a medical condition. Mars claims the band subsequently attempted to oust him altogether and diminish future earnings he claims he's entitled to, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. ""It is beyond sad that, after 41 years together, a band would try to throw out a member who is unable to tour anymore because he has a debilitating disease. Mick has been pushed around for far too long in this band, and we are not going to let that continue,"" Ed McPherson, the attorney representing Mars who filed the lawsuit on Thursday, told CNN in a statement.  McPherson said in the suit that when Mars notified Mötley Crüe that he'd retire from touring due to his ""debilitating"" Ankylosing Spondylitis, a condition that mainly affects the spine, he made it clear that he had no intention of leaving the band, that he could still record with them and still perform with them in a ""residency situation."" The suit alleges the band then called an emergency shareholders meeting for Mötley Crüe's main corporate entity ""in order to throw Mars out of the band, to fire him as a director of the corporation, to fire him as an officer of the corporation, and to take away his shares of the corporation.""  Sasha Frid, litigation counsel for Mötley Crüe, told CNN in a statement that Mars's lawsuit is ""unfortunate and completely off-base,"" and that Mars, and the other members of Mötley Crüe, signed a 2008 agreement that ""in no event shall any resigning shareholder be entitled to receive any monies attributable to live performances (i.e., tours)."" Frid's statement continued to say that after Mars publicly resigned from Mötley Crüe, ""the band offered Mick a generous compensation package to honor his career with the band"" despite ""the fact that the band did not owe Mick anything."" The lawsuit also outlines years of frayed relationships and tumult among members of the band, including allegations that various members performed some songs to pre-recorded tracks while on tour and that bassist Nikki Sixx ""gaslighted"" Mars, creating a false narrative that Mars was making mistakes on tour because of cognitive dysfunction.  McPherson noted in the suit that any errors Mars may have made while on tour were due to his in-ear monitors ""constantly malfunctioning, causing Mars to be unable to hear his own instrument."" ""Mötley Crüe always performs its songs live but during the last tour Mick struggled to remember chords, played the wrong songs and made constant mistakes which led to his departure from the band,"" Frid said in the band's statement.  Mötley Crüe famously reunited in 2019 and announced a new tour after performing what was supposed to be their last show at the end of 2015.",0
494,Emmy Rossum announces birth of son,"In a surprise announcement, actress Emmy Rossum shared on Thursday that she and producer husband Sam Esmail have welcomed a new member to their family.  ""On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born,"" Rossum posted on her verified Instagram account, noting the child's April 5 birth date. Rossum's post also included snapshots of her son's newborn footprints, her pregnant belly, and a sweet black and white photo of the baby snuggled up in a blanket.  The couple are also parents to a 22-month-old daughter.  The announcement comes as a surprise to the general public. Rossum kept the news secret that she and ""Mr. Robot"" creator Esmail were expecting until Thursday's birth announcement.  What's not a surprise, however, is that Rossum was able to pull off such a feat.  In May 2021, Rossum delivered the news that they had welcomed their daughter on Instagram after never previously sharing that she was pregnant.  The ""Shameless"" star is notoriously private but posted a moving message on Mother's Day last year that included photos of her daughter. ""The first year has been full of playing, crawling, eating, carrying pacifiers in mouths and holding hands. I am so deeply grateful to be your mom,"" her post read.  Esmail directed Rossum in the 2014 romantic comedy ""Comet"" before proposing to her the following year. The couple wed in New York in 2017.",0

Irvin Cartagena, who also goes by ""Green Eyes,"" was one of four men charged for being part of a drug trafficking organization that sold deadly fentanyl-laced heroin to Williams. Cartagena pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, heroin and other drugs. Prosecutors allege that Cartagena was the person who conducted the ""the hand-to-hand transaction"" with Williams just before the actor, best known for his role as Omar Little on HBO's ""The Wire,"" died of an accidental overdose. Williams was found dead in his New York City apartment in 2021 in what the New York City Medical Examiner's Officer ruled an accidental overdose. He was 54. ""Irvin Cartagena sold fentanyl-laced heroin in broad daylight in New York City, feeding addiction and causing tragedy,"" the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement Thursday. ""In doing so, he dealt the fatal dose that killed Michael K. Williams."" Cartagena, 39, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison but could face up to 40 years behind bars when he is sentenced by a federal judge. CNN reached out to Cartagena's lawyer for comment.  One of Cartagena's codefendants, Carlos Macci, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute narcotics on Tuesday, according to the court docket. The two other men charged, Hector Robles and Luis Cruz, have pleaded not guilty.",0

498,Lizzo snuggles Grogu in a cameo-filled 'The Mandalorian',"Lizzo has officially joined the ""Star Wars"" galaxy far, far away.  The ""About Damn Time"" singer surprised fans when she appeared in the latest episode of ""The Mandalorian"" as a noblewoman who becomes fast friends with young Grogu (Baby Yoda to the uninitiated).  She cameoed alongside Jack Black, who played her daffy husband. Lizzo floated onscreen as Duchess of the Outer Rim planet Plazir-15, and, from what viewers saw, she spends her time sipping on ""secretions"" and playing interstellar bocce with her court. Black as Captain Bombardier was by her side through it all, a former Imperial officer who fell for the Duchess when he was sent to Plazir for ""rehabilitation."" (He swore in the episode he has no Imperial leanings.)  When Mando, fellow Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze and, of course, Grogu enter her ""domed paradise,"" the Duchess and the baby quickly become close companions. The diminutive green creature even uses the Force to help the Duchess outscore her opponents in a lawn game that involved tossing balled-up, centipede-like creatures through a series of hoops.  Later in the episode, Doc Brown himself appears -- Christopher Lloyd of ""Back to the Future"" played the planet's security head Commissioner Helgait, who oversees the reprogrammed battle droids that citizens of Plazir task with carrying shopping bags or valeting ships.  Later, it's revealed that Helgait, a Separatist loyal to the Sith Count Dooku, purposely messed with some of the droids so they'd malfunction. Lizzo's Duchess gravely exiles him on their planet's moon -- and then lovingly knights Grogu for being his sweet self.  Lizzo is an avowed fan of Grogu -- in 2021, she painted herself green and donned a beige robe and pointy ears to portray the young Force-sensitive alien for Halloween.  Sharing images of herself traipsing around Hollywood in costume, Lizzo facetiously wrote on Instagram: ""A representative from Grogu's publicity team has issued a statement regarding the paparazzi photos taken last night: 'Grogu aka Baby Yoda aka The Child has no recollection of these events. In fact, these events never happened *jedi hand wave*'""  The Emmy and Grammy winner celebrated her appearance on ""The Mandalorian"" with a selfie, flanked by countless Grogu stuffed animals and figurines: ""I'm in Star Wars YALL!""",0

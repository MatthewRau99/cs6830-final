0,FBI warns consumers not to use public phone charging stations,"Security experts have been warning about the dangers of using public charging stations for a while now, and the FBI has recently joined in with a warning to consumers not to use them as they may be susceptible to cyber attacks.

The FBI issued this warning on March 25, 2019, in a public service announcement (PSA) that was designed to raise awareness of the risks associated with charging your smart device in public places.

The announcement stated that hackers are taking advantage of the lack of security surrounding public charging stations to access personal and sensitive information stored on smart devices.

Although the FBI did not cite any specific incidents, it is thought that cyber criminals are using a technique known as “juice jacking,” which is where they install malware onto a public charging station in order to steal personal information from anyone who plugs their device in.

This can include personal data such as contacts, photos, text messages, and other sensitive information, which can then be used for identity theft or fraud.

According to the FBI’s announcement, these cyber criminals will often disguise themselves as charging stations, with some even being created to look like legitimate phone charger stations in public places such as airports and shopping centers.

This makes it difficult for consumers to spot the difference between a genuine phone charger and a fake one, increasing the risk of them falling victim to a cyber attack.

The FBI has advised that people should always check the source of a charging station before plugging in their phone or other smart device.

They have also recommended that people use their own charging cables, rather than those provided, as these may have been tampered with by cyber criminals.

A spokesperson for the FBI stated: “The best way to ensure the security of your device and personal information is to be vigilant when selecting charging stations.”

They continued: “We urge everyone to be cautious when using public charging stations and to always take steps to protect their personal data.”

In addition to the FBI’s announcement, various security experts and agencies have also been highlighting the risks associated with public charging stations.

One such expert is Jim Stickley, CEO of Stickley on Security, who has highlighted how easy it is for cyber criminals to hack into a device through a public charging station.

In an interview with TechRepublic, Stickley said: “It’s really easy for a bad guy to modify these—there’s no way for you to know that they’ve done it.”

He continued: “There’s no way for you to know what’s happening behind the scenes on your phone, and that’s why they can do things like copy all of your information.”

Another expert, Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at antivirus software firm ESET, has highlighted the importance of being aware of the potential risks when using public charging stations.

In an interview with the BBC, Moore warned that using public charging stations is “akin to leaving your house key with a stranger.”

He explained: “It’s putting trust in them that they will only give the key back to you and not copy it.”

Despite the risks highlighted by security experts, many people still use public charging stations on a regular basis.

This is partly due to the fact that many modern smartphones have a short battery life and require frequent charging, particularly if you use them heavily.

Furthermore, many people may not be aware of the risks associated with public charging stations, or may simply forget about them in the rush of everyday life.

So, what can you do to protect yourself from the dangers of public charging stations?

One of the simplest ways is to always carry a portable charger with you, which you can use to charge your phone or other smart device while on the move.

These portable chargers are relatively cheap and easy to use, and will enable you to charge your device wherever you are without having to rely on public charging stations.

You can also use a protective cable that blocks data transfer while allowing charging, such as a “Charge-Only” cable or one that does not have the two data wires connected (“2-Data”). These cables only allow electricity to flow from the charging station to your device, and block any attempts by cyber criminals to steal your data.

Another way to protect yourself is to enable the “USB restricted mode” on your smartphone or other smart device.

This is a feature that was introduced in iOS 11.4.1 and later versions of iOS, which shuts down the charging port to data transfer if it has not been unlocked in the past hour.

To enable this feature, you will need to go to the Settings app on your phone, select “Touch ID & Passcode,” and then toggle on the “USB Accessories” option under the “Allow Access When Locked” section.

Finally, it is important to remain vigilant when using public charging stations.

Always check the source of the charging station before plugging in your device, and never use a charger that appears to be damaged, has been tampered with, or looks suspicious in any way.

If you believe that your device may have been hacked or compromised in any way, it is important to contact your service provider or a security expert immediately.

In conclusion, the FBI’s warning about public charging stations is a reminder of the potential risks associated with using these facilities.

While it may be convenient to plug in your device and charge it while on the move, it is important to remain aware of the risks and take steps to protect yourself and your personal information.

By following the advice of security experts and remaining vigilant, you can help to ensure that your personal data remains safe and secure, even when using public charging stations.",1
1,'Flabbergasted': See doctor's reaction to judge's controversial ruling,"A recent controversial ruling by a judge has left many people in shock and disbelief, including one prominent doctor who took to social media to express her outrage.

Dr. Sarah Carter, a renowned surgeon and medical expert, was flabbergasted when she heard about the ruling that declared it legal to discriminate against patients based on their gender identity. In a Twitter post that quickly went viral, she wrote, ""As a doctor, I took an oath to treat all patients equally and with respect. This ruling is not only unjust but goes against everything I stand for as a healthcare professional.""

The ruling, which came from a federal judge in Texas, stated that doctors and healthcare providers with religious objections to gender-affirming care cannot be forced to provide such care to transgender patients. This means that doctors can turn away transgender patients seeking basic medical care, such as check-ups or preventative screenings.

Dr. Carter, who has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights and healthcare access, says she is appalled by the decision and worried about the implications it could have for transgender patients.

""It's already difficult enough for transgender individuals to access healthcare, and this ruling is only going to make things worse,"" she said. ""No one should be turned away from a doctor's office because of who they are.""

Supporters of the ruling argue that it protects doctors' religious freedoms and prevents them from being forced to provide care that goes against their beliefs. However, critics say it is a clear form of discrimination and could lead to even more barriers for already marginalized groups.

As for Dr. Carter, she says she will continue to fight for equality in healthcare and hopes that others will join her in speaking out against this ruling. ""We cannot allow discrimination to be enshrined in our healthcare system. All patients deserve dignity, respect, and access to the care they need.""",1
2,Nashville sends Justin Jones back to the Tennessee House days after GOP lawmakers ousted him,"Nashville sends Justin Jones back to the Tennessee House days after GOP lawmakers ousted him

Nashville, Tennessee - Justin Jones, a well-known activist and advocate for racial justice, was recently ousted from his position on the Tennessee House of Representatives by the state's Republican lawmakers. However, his constituents had a different plan. After mounting pressure from community members and activists, Jones was reinstated to his position, showing the power and impact of grassroots organizing.

Jones, a 24-year-old Black man, made national headlines in June 2020 when he spray-painted ""They Kill Us"" outside the Tennessee State Capitol during a George Floyd protest. He was subsequently charged with vandalism and faces 10 years in prison if convicted.

Despite this, Jones ran for and won a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives last November, representing a district that includes parts of Nashville. However, it didn't take long for state Republicans to challenge his election.

In late January, Republican lawmakers in the Tennessee House voted to overturn Jones' election, citing the vandalism charges against him as evidence of his supposed unsuitability for office. Jones' supporters immediately decried this move as a nakedly partisan attack.

""Justin Jones did nothing that a thousand other activists didn't do when they vandalized the Tennessee State Capitol,"" said Rev. Sharpton during a press conference condemning the ouster. ""The idea that this is enough to disqualify him from holding public office is absurd and deeply troubling.""

Despite Rev. Sharpton's passionate advocacy, however, it seemed that the vote to oust Jones was final. However, community members and activists soon swung into action, launching a massive campaign to get Jones reinstated to his rightful place in the Tennessee House.

This campaign took many forms, from social media campaigns to protests outside the Tennessee State Capitol. But perhaps the most effective tactic was simply overwhelming Jones' Republican opponents with phone calls, emails, and letters pleading for them to reconsider their vote.

These efforts finally bore fruit earlier this week, when Jones was officially reinstated to his seat in the Tennessee House by a unanimous vote of his colleagues.

Jones took to social media to express his gratitude to all those who had supported him throughout this ordeal, saying ""We made history in Tennessee today. Thank you to all who made calls, wrote letters, and stood with me these past weeks.""

He also used the opportunity to highlight the broader issues of racial justice and police brutality that had led him to run for office in the first place, saying, ""I hope this moment serves as a reminder of the power of grassroots organizing and the need for systemic change.""

Throughout this entire saga, Jones has remained steadfast in his commitment to standing up for the most marginalized communities in Tennessee. His reinstatement to the House of Representatives sends a clear message that, even in the face of concerted attacks from powerful interests, the will of the people can still prevail.

For all the activists, community members, and allies who worked tirelessly on his behalf, this victory is a testament to the power of organizing and the importance of never giving up, no matter how bleak the outlook may seem. As Jones himself put it, ""We can win when we stand together.""",1
3,A coffee chain announced it wants to make your drinks with oat milk. Here's why (2022),"In a move aimed at catering to the growing demand for plant-based food options, a prominent coffee chain has announced its intention to start making drinks with oat milk. The decision comes amid a shift in consumer preferences towards more sustainable and health-conscious food choices.

Oat milk, made from blending whole oats with water and then straining the liquid, has become increasingly popular as a dairy-free alternative. It has a creamy texture and a slightly sweet taste, making it an attractive ingredient in coffee and other beverages. Unlike other milk alternatives, such as almond or soy milk, oat milk is also relatively low in fat and calories, making it a healthier option.

The coffee chain, which has outlets across the United States, said that it decided to introduce oat milk after listening to feedback from customers. ""We know that many people are looking for alternatives to dairy milk, and oat milk has been one of the most requested choices,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""We want to give our customers more options and make it easier for them to enjoy their favorite drinks with their preferred milk.""

The decision to use oat milk is also in line with the company's commitment to sustainability. Oat milk has a much lower carbon footprint than cow's milk, as oat production requires significantly less water and land than dairy farming. Furthermore, the use of plant-based milk reduces the demand for animal products, which can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support biodiversity.

The announcement follows a trend of companies seeking to cater to the growing demand for plant-based food options, as consumers become more aware of the environmental and health benefits of a plant-based diet. In recent years, there has been a surge in the popularity of veganism, with more people adopting a plant-based lifestyle than ever before.

Going forward, it's likely that we'll continue to see more coffee chains and cafes incorporating oat milk and other plant-based milk alternatives into their menus. This reflects a wider shift in consumer preferences towards sustainable and health-conscious food choices, and companies that fail to adapt risk being left behind.

In conclusion, the move towards oat milk by a prominent coffee chain is a sign of changing consumer preferences towards healthier, more sustainable food choices. Oat milk is low in fat and calories, has a smaller carbon footprint than cow's milk, and is popular among those who are lactose intolerant or plant-based eaters. It’s also worth noting that other coffee chains, such as Starbucks and Dunkin', have already introduced oat milk to their menus, and it's likely we'll see more follow suit in the years to come.",1
4,WWE apologizes for using footage of Auschwitz in promotional spot,"In a move that shocked and angered fans across the globe, WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) recently aired a promotional spot that featured footage of former wrestler and Hall of Famer 'Big Show' towering over the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp in Germany. The clip, which was part of a promotional video for the wrestling organization's upcoming event 'WrestleMania 37', received immediate backlash from viewers and sparked widespread condemnation.

Within hours of the clip's airing, social media was flooded with comments from outraged fans and critics, who accused WWE of trivializing the atrocities that took place in Auschwitz during the Holocaust. Many felt that the use of the concentration camp footage for the purposes of promoting a sports entertainment event was completely inappropriate and in poor taste.

The backlash prompted WWE to issue an apology, stating that they had no intention of offending or disrespecting anyone with the clip. Speaking to reporters, a WWE spokesperson said, ""We apologize for any offense that may have been caused by the promotional spot that aired Monday night on WWE programming. We would never intentionally do anything to disrespect the legacy of those who suffered and died during the Holocaust.""

However, many were left questioning how such a mistake could have been made in the first place. Auschwitz, which is located in Poland and was operated by the Nazis during World War II, is widely regarded as one of the darkest chapters in human history. Over a million people, most of them Jewish, were systematically murdered at Auschwitz, with many more subjected to cruel and inhumane conditions.

Despite the apology, some critics argued that WWE had not gone far enough in addressing the issue at hand. They pointed out that the wrestling organization had a responsibility to use its platform in a responsible and respectful way, and suggested that more needed to be done to educate those involved in its creative process.

""The fact that WWE thought it was okay to use footage of Auschwitz to promote a wrestling event speaks volumes about the lack of education and sensitivity within the organization,"" said one commentator. ""This is not just an issue of bad taste - it's an issue of ignorance and a lack of understanding of history and the importance of commemorating those who suffered and died during the Holocaust.""

Others suggested that WWE could use the backlash as an opportunity to raise awareness and promote education about the Holocaust and other atrocities. They proposed that the wrestling organization could work with Holocaust education organizations to develop educational materials and resources for its fans and employees.

Some also pointed out that this incident was not the first time that WWE had come under fire for insensitivity or inappropriate content. In the past, the organization has been criticized for its portrayal of racial and gender stereotypes, as well as for its use of violent or sexually suggestive themes.

Despite the controversies, WWE remains one of the most popular and lucrative entertainment franchises in the world, with a massive fan base and significant cultural influence. As such, some argued that the organization had a responsibility to use its immense platform for good, and to promote values of respect, inclusivity, and social responsibility.

""Whether they like it or not, WWE is a cultural force that shapes the attitudes and perceptions of millions of people around the world,"" said one fan. ""They have a responsibility to make sure that they are promoting positive, respectful messages that reflect the diversity of their audience.""

As the backlash continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how WWE will respond and what actions it will take to address the issue at hand. Regardless of the outcome, however, it is clear that this incident has highlighted the importance of sensitivity and respect when it comes to issues of historical commemoration and education.

More broadly, it has also served as a reminder of the need for cultural organizations and industries to be vigilant and proactive about promoting values of inclusivity, diversity, and social responsibility. In today's rapidly changing and increasingly polarized world, it is more important than ever for cultural leaders to take a stand and use their influence for the greater good.",1
5,'Succession' delivers a major surprise as the show goes back to its future,"HBO's ""Succession"" is considered one of the best shows on television by critics and audiences alike. The drama, created by Jesse Armstrong, follows the Roy family, a dysfunctional media dynasty, as they battle for control of their father's empire. The series has amassed a cult following thanks to its sharp writing, intense performances, and biting humor. The show's third season premiered on Sunday night, and it did not disappoint. In fact, it delivered a major surprise that has fans buzzing.

In the season three premiere, titled ""Secession,"" we see the Roys still reeling from the scandal that engulfed them at the end of season two. The family's patriarch, Logan (Brian Cox), is still in charge of the company, but his power is slipping. His son, Kendall (Jeremy Strong), attempted to oust him in a hostile takeover that failed miserably. Logan's other children, Shiv (Sarah Snook), Roman (Kieran Culkin), and Connor (Alan Ruck), are all jockeying for position, hoping to be the one that their father chooses as his successor.

The episode opens with Kendall in a state of despair. He's drinking heavily, smoking cigarettes, and staring off into the distance. It's clear that his failed coup attempt has taken a toll on him. He's lost his confidence, his drive, and his relationship with his father. In a heartbreaking scene, we see Kendall begging his father to take him back into the fold, telling him that he'll do anything to make it right. Logan's response is brutal: ""You're dead to me, son.""

This sets the tone for the rest of the episode, which is filled with tension, backstabbing, and power plays. Shiv meets with a political consultant to discuss a possible run for office, but quickly realizes that the consultant is more interested in using her family's wealth to advance his own career. Roman tries to cozy up to a new executive at the company, but his attempts at charm fall flat. And Connor announces his intention to run for president, causing his siblings to roll their eyes in disbelief.

But the real surprise comes at the end of the episode. Kendall is driving home, still lost in his thoughts and clearly in a dark place. Suddenly, he swerves off the road and crashes his car into a lake. The scene is shocking, and it leaves viewers wondering if Kendall is dead or alive. But it's not just the fact that the show has seemingly killed off one of its main characters that has fans talking. It's the way that the scene was shot.

Throughout the episode, we see Kendall struggling to come to terms with his failed coup attempt. He's haunted by the memory of his father telling him that he's ""dead to me."" As he drives home, we see him swerving recklessly, almost as if he's trying to punish himself. But as he crashes into the lake, the camera cuts away. We don't see the impact, we don't see the car sinking, and we don't see Kendall struggling to escape. Instead, we see the car from a distance, sinking underwater, as the show's theme song plays in the background.

It's a bold choice by the show's creators, and it's one that has been praised by critics. The decision to not show the impact of the crash or the aftermath is a testament to the show's confidence in its audience. It trusts that we'll be able to fill in the blanks ourselves, and that we'll be left with a haunting, gut-wrenching feeling that will stay with us long after the episode has ended.

But the show's choice to leave things open-ended has also caused some frustration among fans. Social media has been abuzz with theories about what happened to Kendall. Some believe that he's dead, while others think that he survived and will be back to exact his revenge on his family. The ambiguity has left fans hungry for more, and eager to see what comes next.

Overall, the season three premiere of ""Succession"" delivered on all fronts. It was tense, funny, and surprising, all at the same time. The show's writers have once again proven that they have a talent for crafting complex characters and twisting storylines that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. And the standout performance by Jeremy Strong as Kendall only adds to the show's already impressive resume.

""Succession"" has always been a show that's unafraid to take risks, and the decision to seemingly kill off one of its main characters in the season three premiere is just the latest example of that. It's a bold move, and one that's sure to have consequences for the rest of the season. But no matter what happens next, one thing is clear: ""Succession"" is still one of the best shows on television, and it's back to its future in a big way.",1

7,This type of exercise might be better for your brain than biking or jogging,"In a world where we are constantly searching for the best ways to enhance our physical health, we often forget to consider the importance of exercising our brains. However, an emerging body of research suggests that certain activities may be better for our brains than others. 

While activities like biking and jogging are great for your physical health, they may not be the best choice if you are looking to boost your cognitive functioning. According to a new study published in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, dancing may be a more effective exercise for your brain.

The study, which analyzed the brain scans of participants who engaged in either dancing or endurance training, found that dancing led to greater improvements in the brain's white matter integrity. White matter is responsible for connecting different areas of the brain, and its deterioration has been linked to various cognitive problems.

This finding is significant as it suggests that dancing may have unique benefits for our brain health. So, the next time you're looking to exercise your mind and body, why not try something new and hit the dance floor?",1
8,Johnson & Johnson halts development of RSV vaccine in midst of late-stage clinical trials,"Johnson & Johnson, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, has announced that it is halting the development of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine midway through the late-stage clinical trials. The company cited the efficacy of the vaccine during the trials as the reason for discontinuing it.

The decision by the company has come as a major surprise to the medical community and has raised concerns about the direction of the vaccine industry in the future. RSV is a common viral infection that causes respiratory illness among infants, young children, and the elderly. It is a leading cause of hospitalization in infants and is estimated to cause up to 200,000 deaths each year globally.

Johnson & Johnson's RSV vaccine was undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials, the final stage of trials before submitting the vaccine for regulatory approval. The company had invested millions of dollars and years of research into the vaccine's development in the hope of providing a much-needed solution for the prevention and treatment of the respiratory illness. The decision is a significant blow to the company, as it was relying on the vaccine to diversify its vaccine portfolio.

The company's decision has been met with disappointment by medical professionals, who had been eagerly anticipating the results of the trials. ""It is a major setback for the fight against RSV,"" said Dr. Mark Smith, a pediatrician at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center. ""The world needs an effective vaccine to protect against RSV, and the failure of this vaccine is concerning.”

The news of the vaccine's failure has also raised questions about the effectiveness of existing vaccines and the value of investing in the development of new vaccines. RSV vaccines have been in development for decades, but despite significant progress, there is still no effective vaccine available.

RSV is a notoriously difficult virus to target with vaccines, and there are many different strains of the virus that cause illness. The virus also mutates rapidly, making it difficult to develop a vaccine that can provide long-term protection. Although several vaccine candidates have reached clinical trials in recent years, none have yet been approved for use.

The decision by Johnson & Johnson to discontinue the vaccine's development highlights the challenges faced by companies in the vaccine industry. Developing vaccines is a complex and expensive process that can take years and requires significant investment. The risks involved in vaccine development are high, and the failure of a vaccine in late-stage clinical trials can result in significant losses for companies.

The development of vaccines for infectious diseases is essential for protecting public health, but it is a risky business. Companies invest significant resources into the development of vaccines, often with no guarantee of success. The failure of the Johnson & Johnson RSV vaccine is a stark reminder of the challenges and risks involved in vaccine development.

The decision by Johnson & Johnson to halt the development of the RSV vaccine comes at a time when vaccines are in the spotlight due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 has been intense, with several vaccines currently in clinical trials. The failure of the RSV vaccine serves as a cautionary tale for companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, highlighting the challenges and risks involved.

The challenges of RSV vaccine development also raise broader questions about the value of investing in vaccine research. Developing new vaccines is an expensive and risky business, which can take years to yield results. Despite the high costs and risks involved, vaccines are essential for protecting public health and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

The news of the Johnson & Johnson RSV vaccine's failure is undoubtedly disappointing, but it is important to remember that vaccine development is a long and complex process. The failure of a vaccine does not mean that progress has not been made or that the vaccine industry is failing. It simply highlights the importance of continued investment in research, innovation, and collaboration.

The development of vaccines is a critical component of public health, and it is essential that the industry continues to pursue the development of new vaccines to protect against infectious diseases. Vaccine development will always be a risky business, but the potential benefits of success are too great to ignore.

In conclusion, the failure of the Johnson & Johnson RSV vaccine is a significant setback for the fight against respiratory syncytial virus, a common viral infection that causes respiratory illness among infants, young children, and the elderly. The decision to halt the vaccine's development midway through the late-stage clinical trials highlights the challenges and risks involved in vaccine development. It is a stark reminder of the importance of continued investment in vaccine research to protect public health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Although the news is disappointing, it is essential that companies continue to pursue the development of new vaccines to provide much-needed solutions for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.",1
9,American offices are half-empty. That could be the next big risk for banks,"American offices are half-empty. That could be the next big risk for banks

As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to impact the world, businesses have been struggling to find ways to adapt to the new normal. One of the most significant changes brought on by the pandemic is the widespread adoption of remote work arrangements. In the banking industry, many companies have embraced the work-from-home model, and while it may have worked well in the short term, it is starting to become a major risk for the sector.

The shift to remote work happened almost overnight when the pandemic hit, and it was a necessary response to the unprecedented situation. But with the vaccine rollout gaining momentum, major issues are beginning to emerge. For example, bankers are becoming concerned that the empty offices across the country could have a detrimental effect on the health of the banking industry. 

Banks have long been at the center of many national economies, and they are essential for the smooth functioning of financial systems. But now, with employees working from home and the trend for office space downsizing, there are concerns that the loss of work from the banking centers could have significant negative effects on the industry.

The reasons behind the shift are undoubtedly linked to the pandemic. Remote work has become increasingly popular as social distancing measures have become the norm. With the use of teleconferencing capabilities and other digital communication tools, many employees have been able to work from home.

Banks, in particular, have responded by supporting flexible work arrangements in order to help their employees stay safe while continuing to operate. Remote work has allowed many banks to continue serving customers while also protecting employees from the risk of exposure to Covid-19. However, this transition has also been fraught with challenges.

When banks first began working from home arrangements, there was a great deal of uncertainty. Managers had to establish remote teams quickly; employee access to required technology had to be guaranteed, and existing infrastructure had to be adapted so that work could be done remotely.

Now, as the pandemic continues to disrupt traditional office work, banks are scanning the horizon for signs of future risks. They are asking themselves what the long-term effects of remote working will be and whether remote teams can be as effective as traditional teams.

One of the biggest risks posed by remote work is the possibility of losing touch with clients. Client relationships are crucial for banks, and they help drive revenue. Without face-to-face contact with customers, employees may not be able to develop the same level of understanding of client needs and concerns as before.

The loss of personal interaction with clients can also lead to a lack of motivation for employees, reduced career advancement opportunities, and less development of new ideas required for business growth.

Moreover, the work-from-home model could hurt specific parts of the banking industry. For example, if remote workers cannot provide adequate customer support, customers may look to switch to other banking alternatives with better support options. 

There will also be an impact on the technology infrastructure required to support remote work arrangements, and there may be new regulation requirements that banks need to understand and comply with.

Another problem is that WFH (work from home) is not suitable for everyone, which can lead to increased staff turnover and other issues related to employee engagement. This could lead to high costs, as banks try to recruit and retain employees who are able to work from home effectively.

There is also a real concern that employees may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers and supervisors. This isolation can lead to unproductive work, lack of motivation, and other behavioral and mental health issues.

Even though banks have created their unique COVID-19 response, which allows employees to work from home, there is a valid argument to suggest that it's not effective in the long run. Industries like banking rely heavily on teamwork, collaboration, and client interaction, which are all difficult to achieve remotely.

The future of the banking industry post-pandemic is uncertain, but it's clear that banks must take steps to ensure that their employees can return to the office sooner rather than later. The banking industry relies on the interaction of employees, clients, and peers. None of that can be achieved effectively without in-person collaboration and communication.

Fortunately, many banks are now starting to develop plans for a smooth return to the workplace. They are taking a phased approach, with some employees returning first, followed by others as conditions improve.

But returning to the office is not just about re-establishing old habits. Banks will need to address specific issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, employers may consider investing in touchless technologies, restructuring the workplace to meet social distancing requirements, and increasing cleaning and disinfection protocols.

The banks will need to navigate this transition carefully. Employers must weigh the benefits of returning to the workplace against the risks of in-person meetings, including the potential for increased Covid-19 transmission.

The banking industry must also take steps to maintain its reputation for client satisfaction and excellent customer service. Employees must continue providing high-level support, and support operations must be optimized, even as workers return to the office.

There are many different ways that banks can address these issues, and many are already developing strategies for returning to the office. Some banks are investing in new technologies that allow for hybrid models of work, in which employees can work from home but are also able to come into the office and work together when required. 

Others are focused on developing a more flexible workplace, in which employees can work on-site, remotely or in a hybrid work mode. This could help employees maintain a better work-life balance and reduce the stress of being in the office all the time.

Other financial institutions are choosing virtual collaboration tools, increasing automation or even reducing the office's physical footprint to support a leaner post-pandemic operation.

However, many industry experts think it is too early to tell which solution will emerge as the preferred model of the future. One thing is clear: the banking industry must adapt to the new reality of work, and it must do so quickly.

In conclusion, while working from home may have been successful in mitigating many of the risks presented by Covid-19, there are concerns that it will cause more considerable issues for the banking industry in the long run. This could lead to the loss of human talent, customer satisfaction, and ultimately the industry's bottom line. 

Banks must find ways to return to in-person communication and collaboration while adapting to the new normal of post-pandemic life. As the world shifts to a post-pandemic future, banks must be prepared to act quickly and decisively.",1
10,India's endangered tiger population is rebounding in triumph for conservationists,"India’s tiger population has had a rough history, with the country once witnessing hundreds of thousands of tigers roaming freely in its forests in the early 20th century. However, due to rampant hunting, poaching, loss of habitat, and several other reasons, the tiger population has drastically dwindled, with only around 1,400 tigers remaining in India in the 1970s. At the time, it seemed as though the critically endangered species was destined toward extinction. However, thanks to the concerted efforts of conservationists across India, the tiger population is now reaching a point of rebound.

As per the latest tiger census conducted in 2018, there are over 2,967 tigers in India, marking a staggering 33% increase in numbers in just four years.

The remarkable rebound of India’s tiger population is the result of the hard work, dedication, and relentless conservation efforts of several organizations, including the Indian government, NGOs, and local communities. The efforts are paying off, but there is still a long way to go to ensure that the tiger population continues to thrive in the future.

One of the most crucial aspects of saving the tiger population has been the conservation of their habitats, which are mainly forests in India. The Indian government has focused on protecting forests that are home to tigers, and several schemes have been implemented to ensure their conservation. The Ministry of Environment in India launched the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats (IDWH) scheme, providing financial aid to states to promote the conservation of forests and wildlife habitats. This scheme has played a significant role in providing resources to conserve tiger habitats across India.

The government’s efforts have also been supplemented by NGOs, which have been working tirelessly in the field of tiger conservation for several years. The NGOs have been involved in various aspects of tiger conservation, including community outreach, research, and awareness campaigns. They have been instrumental in raising awareness about the importance of protecting tiger habitats and how people can contribute towards this goal.

One of the most notable NGOs involved in tiger conservation is the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Established in 1991, the organization has been working towards the conservation of tigers and other wildlife species in India. They operate in various tiger reserves across India, including the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve and the Sariska Tiger Reserve. WCS works on several fronts, including monitoring and research, community outreach, and advocacy by partnering with the government and other stakeholders.

Another organization that has been instrumental in tiger conservation is the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). They have been working towards the conservation of tigers for several years and were responsible for launching the Tigers Alive Initiative. The initiative aims to conserve tiger habitats and to reduce human-tiger conflicts. WWF has been actively involved in various aspects of tiger conservation across India.

In addition to the efforts of NGOs and the government in tiger conservation, local communities have played a crucial role in the protection of the tiger population in India. Many village communities who live close to tiger habitats have been involved in conservation efforts. They have participated in tiger monitoring programs, actively reported any suspicious poaching activities, and have also been involved in awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of tiger conservation.

One such village community that has played a critical role in tiger conservation is the Bishnoi community. This community, which practices traditional conservation in western Rajasthan, has been instrumental in saving tigers from poachers several times. Their contribution to conservation was recognized by the government, which awarded them the ‘Conservation of Wildlife’ award.

Despite the efforts by the government, NGOs, and local communities, the tiger population still faces several challenges that threaten their existence. One of the most significant challenges is human-tiger conflict. The increasing human population in India has led to the encroachment of forests, leading to habitat degradation and fragmentation. This has resulted in the displacement of tigers from their habitats and increased conflicts with humans. In addition, poaching remains a significant threat to the tiger population in India, with tiger parts being highly valued on the black market.

To tackle these challenges, it is essential to continue implementing effective conservation strategies. Conservationists must work towards raising awareness about the importance of tiger conservation among local communities and the government. They should also emphasize the need to conserve forests that are essential tiger habitats.

One of the best ways that conservationists can achieve success is by partnering with local communities, who offer valuable insights into conservation efforts. By engaging communities in conservation programs, conservationists can develop a sense of ownership towards the tiger population, leading to a better understanding of the need for conservation.

The Indian government must also continue to provide support for tiger conservation, both financially and logistically. This support can include providing the resources needed to monitor and protect tiger habitats, deploying anti-poaching teams, and raising awareness about the importance of tiger conservation among the general public.

Finally, it is essential to address the root causes of human-tiger conflict in India. This can be achieved by developing policies that promote sustainable land use, as well as implementing measures that reduce the human footprint in forests. The government must work towards providing alternative livelihoods for communities that depend on forests for survival.

India’s remarkable success in tiger conservation is a testament to the value of conservation efforts. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the efforts must continue. The government, NGOs, and local communities must continue to work together to ensure that the tiger population continues to thrive in India. With continued efforts, conservationists hope that India’s tiger population will continue to increase, leading to the ultimate goal of seeing the endangered species off the critically endangered list.",1
11,Biden heads to Northern Ireland to mark accord anniversary,"Former Vice President Joe Biden is set to visit Northern Ireland this week to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. The accord, which was signed in 1998, is considered a landmark achievement for both the United Kingdom and Ireland, bringing an end to decades of sectarian violence known as ""The Troubles.""

12,Tucker Carlson raged against Trump in private. But in interview with the former president he took a very different tone,"The political landscape in America has been dominated by conflicts and clashes between different factions of the political elite. One of the most prominent figures in this arena has been Tucker Carlson, a conservative pundit with a huge following among right-wing voters.

In recent months, Carlson has made headlines for his criticisms of former President Donald Trump, his one-time ally. The Fox News host has been vocal about his frustrations with Trump's behavior, especially in the aftermath of the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol. Carlson has openly criticized Trump's response to the events and some of his supporters have even called for his dismissal from Fox News.

However, in a recent interview with Trump, Carlson took a very different tone, seemingly ignoring past criticisms and instead, praising the former president. This apparent shift in Carlson's approach has raised questions about his political motivations and his true feelings towards Trump.

In private, Carlson was said to have raged against Trump following the Capitol insurrection. According to sources, the Fox News host was outraged by Trump's behavior during the attack, including his delay in calling for the National Guard to assist the besieged Capitol Police officers. It was also reported that Carlson had warned his colleagues at Fox News to distance themselves from Trump to preserve their journalistic credibility.

This was seen as a surprising development, given Carlson's previous reputation as a staunch Trump supporter. He had been known for his unwavering loyalty to the former president, frequently defending him on his show and attacking his critics in the media.

But just a few weeks after Trump left the White House, Carlson's tune seemed to have changed. He began to question Trump's leadership and criticized his handling of the insurrection. Some of his segments on Fox News were deemed to be critical of the former president and his administration.

This drew criticism from Trump's loyal supporters, who accused Carlson of betrayal and called for his dismissal from Fox News. Some even organized a boycott of his show, prompting advertisers to pull their support.

Undeterred, Carlson continued to question Trump's actions, and his criticisms became more frequent and more pointed. In one segment, he criticized Trump's decision to pardon Roger Stone, a longtime ally who had been found guilty of multiple crimes, including witness tampering and obstruction of justice.

Carlson's criticisms continued in the lead-up to Trump's second impeachment trial. He criticized Trump's legal team and argued that the former president had left himself vulnerable to prosecution by encouraging his supporters to storm the Capitol.

It seemed, for a moment, that Carlson had turned on Trump, becoming one of the few conservative commentators willing to hold the former president accountable for his actions. But then came the interview with Trump, and all of that seemed to fall by the wayside.

In the interview, Carlson seemed to have lost all of his skepticism and criticisms of Trump. Instead, he praised the former president and his achievements, including economic growth and foreign policy achievements.

He also expressed faith in Trump's future political prospects, calling him a ""leader of the movement"" and predicting that he could run for office again in the future. It was a striking departure from his previous criticisms of Trump, and it left many of his viewers confused and bewildered.

The interview highlighted the potential pitfalls of political commentary in the age of Trump. Carlson, like many other commentators, has built his career on stoking the fires of partisanship and ideological conflict. He has relied on his viewers' loyalty to Trump and the conservative movement to maintain his popularity and power.

But as Trump's presidency came to a tumultuous end, Carlson found himself caught between two competing forces: his loyalty to Trump and his devotion to conservative principles. To his credit, he attempted to hold Trump accountable for his actions, and to help steer the conservative movement towards a more principled and less divisive future.

However, the interview with Trump showed that, in the end, Carlson was unable or unwilling to break free from the constraints of partisanship and personal loyalty. He was, and remains, a creature of the conservative media ecosystem, reliant on ratings, clicks, and advertising dollars to maintain his power and influence.

This has left many viewers questioning Carlson's motivations and intentions. Was his criticism of Trump genuine, or was it a calculated attempt to burnish his own credentials as a principled conservative commentator? And was his interview with Trump an attempt to curry favor with the former president and his supporters, or was it an authentic expression of his true beliefs and feelings towards Trump?

The answer to these questions is unclear, and may never be fully known. But what is clear is that Carlson's shifting approach to Trump highlights the deep divisions and contradictions within the conservative movement, and the challenges that this movement will face in the post-Trump era.

As the Republican Party moves forward, it will need to grapple with the legacy of Trump's presidency, and the divisions that it has created within the conservative movement. Commentators like Carlson will play a key role in shaping the future of this movement, and the direction it takes will have significant consequences for the future of American politics.

Will the movement continue down the path of partisanship and division, or will it embrace a more principled and constructive approach to governance? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the future of the conservative movement is in a state of flux, and its trajectory will be shaped by the actions and decisions of its most prominent leaders and commentators.",1
13,Xylazine test strips available to help users check for animal sedative in drugs,"In recent years, there has been an alarming surge in the use of xylazine, an animal sedative, in street drugs. Xylazine is a potent tranquilizer that is used in veterinary medicine to sedate horses and other large animals. It can cause rapid heart rate, respiratory depression, and even death when used in combination with other drugs. Unfortunately, it has also become a popular ingredient in street drugs, such as heroin and cocaine.

In response to this growing problem, drug testing laboratories have developed xylazine test strips that can help users check for the presence of this dangerous drug in their drugs. These test strips are simple to use and provide quick and accurate results.

Xylazine is a non-opioid sedative that acts on the central nervous system. It works by depressing the activity of the brain and nervous system, leading to drowsiness and a decreased ability to feel pain. In veterinary medicine, it is used to sedate large animals for procedures such as surgery or dental work. However, when used in humans, it can have serious health consequences.

In recent years, xylazine has become an increasingly popular adulterant in street drugs, particularly among drug dealers looking to stretch their supply or enhance the psychoactive effects of their drugs. Xylazine is commonly added to heroin, cocaine, and other drugs of abuse, and users are often unaware of its presence.

The use of xylazine in street drugs has been linked to a number of adverse health effects, including respiratory depression, cardiac arrest, seizures, and even death. It can also cause a range of other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and disorientation. Unfortunately, because xylazine is not a controlled substance, it is difficult to monitor and regulate its use in street drugs.

To address this problem, drug testing laboratories have developed xylazine test strips that can help users check for the presence of this dangerous drug in their drugs. These test strips are simple to use and provide quick and accurate results, allowing users to identify the presence of xylazine and make informed decisions about their drug use.

Drug testing laboratories have been producing test strips for months now, and they are starting to gain popularity among drug users. The strip is a paper card, about the size of a business card, with two neon strips on it. One strip is a control strip, and the other is a test strip.

To use the xylazine test strip, users simply place a small amount of the drug they want to test on the test strip and add a few drops of water. The strip then turns blue if xylazine is present, indicating a positive result. If the strip remains colorless, it is negative for the presence of xylazine.

The xylazine test strips have become increasingly popular among drug users who are concerned about the risks of using adulterated drugs. Advocates for the use of these strips argue that they can help prevent overdoses and other health problems associated with xylazine use.

Experts believe that the widespread use of xylazine in street drugs is a symptom of a larger problem in the illicit drug trade. As drug supplies become more limited and dealers seek to maximize profits, they are turning to cheaper, more dangerous adulterants like xylazine to make their drugs appear more potent.

Law enforcement officials are also concerned about the growing use of xylazine in the drug trade. While the drug is not currently scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, some states have taken steps to regulate its use. For example, in New York City, xylazine is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance, which means that it is subject to tighter regulation and control.

Despite the growing popularity of xylazine test strips, there are some concerns about the availability and reliability of these tests. Some experts have noted that the strips may not be accurate in all situations, as other substances in the drug being tested may interfere with the results.

Others have raised concerns about the potential message that the use of these strips could send to drug users. Some worry that the availability of test strips may inadvertently encourage drug use by giving users a false sense of security and encouraging them to experiment with drugs they might otherwise avoid.

Advocates of the xylazine test strips, however, argue that these concerns are unfounded. They say that the strips provide an important harm reduction tool for drug users, allowing them to make informed decisions about their drug use and helping them to avoid potentially deadly substances.

The development and distribution of xylazine test strips is just one example of the growing interest in harm reduction strategies that seek to minimize the risks associated with drug use. Other harm reduction strategies include needle exchange programs, drug treatment programs, and overdose prevention measures such as the distribution of naloxone, an opioid overdose-reversal drug.

While some may argue that these measures do nothing to address the root causes of drug use or addiction, proponents of harm reduction see them as an important step toward reducing the harms associated with the drug trade and helping drug users stay safe and healthy.

In conclusion, the use of xylazine in street drugs is a growing concern in the United States, and the development of xylazine test strips is one important tool that can help drug users stay safe and informed. As the illicit drug trade continues to evolve, it is likely that new and innovative harm reduction strategies will continue to emerge to help address the challenges facing drug users and public health officials alike.",1
14,Make your own bed: will less daily housekeeping hurt the hotel business?,"In an effort to reduce contact between guests and employees during the Covid-19 pandemic, hotels around the world have started implementing new policies regarding daily housekeeping. Longer stays may mean less frequent cleaning, and some hotels are giving guests the option to opt out of daily room cleaning altogether. While these changes may be perceived as positive for guests who prefer privacy and to limit contact, it raises the question: Will fewer housekeeping services negatively impact the hotel business?

For years, daily housekeeping services have been a staple in the hotel industry. For some guests, the daily cleaning and bed-making is a perk that adds value to their stay. But given the current climate and the need to minimize contact, it's understandable that hotels are adjusting their policies.

However, the change in service may not necessarily be met with enthusiasm by all guests. Some may find that fewer housekeeping services are inconvenient, especially if they are used to having their room tidied up every day. In the long term, this could result in less repeat business and negative reviews.

On the other hand, more environmentally conscious travelers may applaud the move towards less frequent cleaning. With fewer resources being used for daily cleaning, hotels could advertise their commitment to sustainability and appeal to a larger group of guests who prioritize eco-friendliness.

Overall, it remains to be seen whether this shift towards fewer housekeeping services will be beneficial or detrimental to the hotel industry. Only time will tell if guests will embrace the changes or seek out establishments with traditional daily housekeeping services.",1
15,Mother of 6-year-old student who shot teacher charged with child neglect,"In a shocking turn of events, the mother of a six-year-old student who shot his first-grade teacher has been arrested and charged with child neglect. The incident occurred at Moss Elementary School in Cocoa, Florida on August 15, 2019. The young boy had brought his grandmother's handgun to school and shot his teacher, Sharon L. Hill, in the leg before school had even officially started for the day.

The mother in question, Maribel Rosado Morales, 34, was arrested on September 5, 2019, and has been charged by the Brevard County Sheriff's Office with two counts of child neglect that resulted in great bodily harm. The charges stem from the fact that the young boy had allegedly exhibited violent behavior in the past, which Morales was aware of, yet failed to seek medical attention or any form of professional help for her son.

The incident has sparked a national debate on the responsibilities parents have when it comes to raising their children, especially in cases where their behavior may be deemed dangerous or potentially harmful. Many have expressed their sympathy for the victims of the incident, while others have criticized the mother's actions and the school's handling of the situation.

A History of Violent Behavior

The young shooter had reportedly exhibited violent behavior in the past, and his mother was aware of the situation. According to the police report, the young boy had allegedly been threatening his classmates with violence and had been suspended twice for his behavior. His father, who is divorced from Morales, had also reportedly contacted her multiple times in the past to address his concerns about their son's behavior.

Despite these warning signs, Morales had allegedly failed to seek any sort of professional help or medical attention for her son. This lack of action has resulted in her being charged with child neglect. The charges are based on the fact that Morales knew about her son's violent tendencies and yet did nothing to address them, thus putting other children at risk.

The shooting incident has put the spotlight on the importance of early intervention when it comes to children who exhibit violent behavior. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), early detection, and treatment of violent behavior can help prevent future incidents. Unfortunately, many parents are still reluctant to seek help or are unaware of the resources available to them.

The Aftermath of the Shooting

The shooting incident left many parents, teachers, and children traumatized. The school was closed for two days following the incident to allow for a thorough investigation to be conducted. The young boy was taken into custody and was later charged with attempted murder, possession of a firearm on school property, and battery on a school employee. He is currently in the custody of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice.

Sharon L. Hill, the teacher who was shot, has been recovering from her injuries. She has since returned to work, but many teachers and staff at the school are still struggling to come to terms with what happened. The incident has caused an outpouring of support from the community, with many reaching out to offer their condolences and support.

The school district has since implemented new policies to help ensure the safety of students and staff. All schools in the district now have metal detectors at all entrances, and security personnel have been added to staff. Additionally, the district has implemented new policies to help identify students who may be at risk of violent or harmful behavior.

The Importance of Early Intervention

The shooting incident in Cocoa, Florida, has brought the issue of child neglect and the importance of early intervention to the forefront. Many are calling for parents to be held more accountable for the actions of their children, especially when it comes to issues of violence and neglect.

According to the NIMH, early intervention for children who exhibit violent behavior is critical to preventing future incidents. This can include therapy, counseling, medication, or other forms of treatment. Unfortunately, many parents are still hesitant to seek help or are unaware of the resources available to them.

Experts say that parents need to be vigilant and proactive when it comes to identifying signs of violent behavior in their children. Some warning signs can include aggression, anger, resentment, and violent tendencies. Other signs may include depression, anxiety, or other behavioral issues.

Parents are also being urged to seek professional help if they suspect that their child may be at risk of violent or harmful behavior. This can include talking to a pediatrician, therapist, counselor, or other mental health professionals.

Conclusion

The shooting incident at Moss Elementary School in Cocoa, Florida, has brought the issue of child neglect and the importance of early intervention to the forefront. The mother of the young shooter has been charged with two counts of child neglect, based on the fact that she was aware of her son's violent tendencies and failed to seek professional help.

16,How electric tuk-tuks could become a 'virtual power plant' for this country,"How electric tuk-tuks could become a 'virtual power plant' for this country

In countries like India and Thailand, tuk-tuks – small, three-wheeled vehicles – are a common sight on the streets. They're affordable, practical, and often used as a quick and convenient way to get around in congested urban areas. However, tuk-tuks also contribute to air pollution, noise pollution, and carbon emissions. Now, a group of researchers is exploring a way to turn tuk-tuks from a problem into a solution: by using them as mobile energy storage units, or a ""virtual power plant.""

The project is being led by a team of researchers from Deakin University in Australia, in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka. The team is focusing on the city of Delhi, where tuk-tuks are a common mode of transportation. They plan to install small, portable battery packs in tuk-tuks, which can be charged using solar panels. These batteries would then be used to store excess energy from the city's electrical grid, which can be accessed during times of high demand.

""The idea is to use tuk-tuks as mobile batteries,"" explains Dr. Kourosh Kalantar-Zadeh, a professor at Deakin University and one of the project's leads. ""We want to create a system where tuk-tuks can be charged during the day, when there's plenty of sunlight, and then be used to power homes and businesses at night, when demand is highest.""

The project is still in its early stages, but the researchers are hopeful that it could have a significant impact on the city's energy grid. Delhi is home to over 18 million people, and its rapid growth has put a strain on the city's infrastructure. Blackouts and brownouts are common, and the city relies heavily on coal-fired power plants to meet its energy needs. By using tuk-tuks as a ""virtual power plant,"" the researchers believe they could help reduce the city's reliance on fossil fuels and improve energy security.

""Our goal is to create a decentralized, community-based energy system,"" says Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh. ""By using tuk-tuks as energy storage units, we can help distribute power more efficiently and reduce the strain on the city's electrical grid.""

The project is also part of a larger trend towards using renewable energy to power transportation. Electric cars and buses are becoming more common in cities around the world, but tuk-tuks offer several advantages over these larger vehicles. For one, they're much cheaper to produce and maintain, which makes them more accessible to low-income communities. They're also smaller and more maneuverable, which makes them better suited to navigating congested urban streets.

But perhaps the biggest advantage of using tuk-tuks as a ""virtual power plant"" is that it doesn't require any new infrastructure. Unlike installing solar panels on buildings or building new power plants, the tuk-tuk project can be implemented quickly and easily, using existing vehicles and solar technology.

The plan is to install the battery packs in 10,000 tuk-tuks in Delhi over the next four years. The batteries are modular and can be easily swapped in and out, so tuk-tuk drivers can still use their vehicles as they normally would. The researchers estimate that each tuk-tuk could store up to 5 kilowatt-hours of energy, which is enough to power a typical Indian household for about six hours.

The battery packs themselves are designed to be lightweight, durable, and easy to install. They're made from a combination of carbon fiber and other high-strength materials, which helps keep them small and portable. They can be charged using either solar panels or regular electrical outlets, depending on availability.

The project has already received funding from several sources, including the Australian government and the University of Moratuwa. The team is also working with several partners in India, including the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles and the Centre for Energy Studies at IIT Delhi.

Despite the promising early results, the project still faces several challenges. For one, the researchers need to ensure that the tuk-tuk drivers are willing to participate in the program. Electric tuk-tuks are still a relatively new concept in India, and many drivers may be hesitant to invest in the technology without a clear financial incentive.

To address this issue, the researchers are exploring several different business models, including leasing the battery packs to the tuk-tuk drivers or paying them a small fee for participating in the program. They're also working with local governments to provide support and incentives for drivers who make the switch to electric vehicles.

Another challenge is ensuring that the battery packs are compatible with different types of tuk-tuks. There are dozens of different models and manufacturers of tuk-tuks in India, each with their own unique specifications and dimensions. The researchers need to develop battery packs that can fit in any type of tuk-tuk, without requiring significant modifications to the vehicle itself.

Despite these challenges, the researchers are optimistic about the potential of their project. They believe that electric tuk-tuks could become a key part of India's transition to renewable energy, helping to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and increase access to clean energy.

""Electric tuk-tuks are not just a solution for transportation – they're a solution for energy storage,"" says Dr. Kalantar-Zadeh. ""We believe that by working with local communities and governments, we can create a sustainable, decentralized energy system that benefits everyone.""

The project is still in its early stages, but the researchers are already planning to expand their work to other cities in India and around the world. They believe that electric tuk-tuks could be the future of transportation – and energy storage – in cities everywhere, helping to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for all.",1
17,Where jobs were gained and lost in March,"In March of 2021, the United States saw a significant amount of job growth as the country continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were still pockets of the economy that struggled to regain pre-pandemic levels.

Overall, the country added 916,000 jobs in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate decreased to 6.0%, down from 6.2% in February.

Most of the job gains were in the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 280,000 jobs. This industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, with many restaurants, bars, and hotels closing or operating at limited capacity.

The food services and drinking places subsector alone added 176,000 jobs in March. Many of these were in full-service restaurants, which added 103,000 jobs, and in bars and taverns, which added 64,000 jobs. However, employment in these subsectors is still down by 1.8 million and 1.3 million jobs, respectively, compared to pre-pandemic levels.

Other industries that saw significant job growth in March include:

- Construction: 110,000 jobs added
- Professional and business services: 66,000 jobs added
- Education and health services: 64,000 jobs added
- Manufacturing: 53,000 jobs added

The construction industry has seen a strong recovery in recent months, with employment now just 182,000 jobs below pre-pandemic levels. The majority of the job gains in March were in specialty trade contractors, which added 82,000 jobs.

Professional and business services also saw job growth, with the professional and technical services subsector adding 37,000 jobs and the administrative and support services subsector adding 37,000 jobs.

The education and health services industry saw gains in both healthcare and private education. Healthcare added 46,000 jobs in March, while private education added 16,000 jobs.

The manufacturing industry continued to recover in March, with durable goods manufacturing adding 30,000 jobs and nondurable goods manufacturing adding 23,000 jobs.

Despite these job gains, there were still industries that struggled in March. Employment in the retail trade industry was essentially unchanged, with only 23,000 jobs added. Clothing and clothing accessories stores saw a decline in employment, losing 20,000 jobs.

The information industry also saw a decline in employment, losing 2,000 jobs. This industry has struggled in recent years due to technological advancements and changes in consumer behavior.

Additionally, employment in the mining industry was essentially unchanged in March, with only 7,000 jobs added. Employment in this industry has been on a downward trend for several years, due in part to a decrease in demand for coal.

The government sector saw a slight increase in employment, adding 136,000 jobs in March. This was largely driven by state and local government education, which added 76,000 jobs.

Overall, March was a positive month for job growth in the United States, with many industries seeing significant gains. While there are still industries that are struggling to recover, the overall trend is towards a stronger and more stable economy.",1
18,'SNL' spoofs Dana Bash during Trump indictment coverage. See her reaction,"The well-known American television show ""Saturday Night Live"" (SNL) aired yet another episode of witty and politically charged satire.

In fact, she has previously tweeted with humor regarding the show's coverage of CNN.

All in all, SNL's latest skit offers a lighthearted commentary to the heated political climate, and offers Bash and CNN some well-deserved comedic relief.",1
19,Jozzy: Meet the artist Diddy called 'the R&B Biggie',"The music industry is constantly evolving, with new artists emerging on the scene every day. One such artist is Jozzy, a singer-songwriter who has recently caught the attention of music mogul Diddy. He has been dubbed the ""R&B Biggie"" by the Bad Boy Records founder, and for good reason.

Jozzy, whose real name is Jocelyn Donald, was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee. She grew up in a musically inclined household, where her mother played gospel music and her father played in a blues band. Jozzy's love for music started at a young age, and she began writing songs at just nine years old.

In an interview with Forbes, Jozzy spoke about how her upbringing influenced her music. ""I come from a city that is known for soul music, blues, and rock 'n' roll,"" she said. ""So, it's always been in my blood.""

After attending the University of Memphis on a music scholarship, Jozzy moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional songwriter. She worked odd jobs to make ends meet, but it wasn't long before she got her big break.

Jozzy landed a job as a songwriter for Timbaland's production company, where she collaborated with artists like Missy Elliott, Chris Brown, and Ciara. She then signed a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music, where she wrote songs for Beyoncé, Tinashe, and 21 Savage, among others.

Despite her success as a songwriter, Jozzy always knew that she wanted to be an artist in her own right. In 2018, she released her debut single, ""Push Thru,"" which garnered positive reviews from music critics and fans alike.

But it was her collaboration with Lil Wayne on the song ""Sucker for Pain"" that really put Jozzy on the map. The song, which was featured on the Suicide Squad soundtrack, became an instant hit and earned Jozzy a Grammy nomination.

It was around this time that Diddy took notice of Jozzy's talent. He invited her to his home to play him some of her music, and the two hit it off immediately. ""I heard some of the most refreshing and out-of-the-box music,"" Diddy said in an Instagram post. ""I said to myself, 'This is next level.'""

Diddy went on to sign Jozzy to his label, Bad Boy Records, and has been working with her closely ever since. In an interview with Billboard, Jozzy spoke about the experience of working with Diddy. ""It's been amazing,"" she said. ""He just tells me to be myself and do my thing. He's always giving me words of encouragement.""

Jozzy's music is often compared to that of legendary artists like Lauryn Hill and Beyoncé, but she has a style all her own. Her music is a blend of R&B, hip-hop, and soul, with lyrics that are both personal and universal.

In her song ""I'm Gone,"" Jozzy sings about the struggles she's faced as a black woman in the music industry. ""I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone 'cause I'm tired of being told what to do,"" she sings. ""I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone 'cause they don't wanna let me be me.""

Jozzy's music is not only catchy and relatable, but also empowering. Her songs inspire listeners to be confident in themselves and to pursue their dreams, no matter what obstacles they may face.

In addition to her solo work, Jozzy has also collaborated with other artists, including Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish. She co-wrote Lil Nas X's hit song ""Old Town Road,"" which broke records and became the longest-running number one song in Billboard Hot 100 history.

Jozzy's collaboration with Billie Eilish, ""Bury a Friend,"" won a Grammy for Song of the Year in 2020. The song, which was co-written by Jozzy, explores themes of anxiety and mental health.

Despite her success as a songwriter and collaborator, Jozzy remains focused on her own music career. She recently released her debut EP, ""Souvenir,"" which features six tracks that showcase her unique sound and style.

The EP includes the single ""Funny Friends,"" which was produced by Diddy and features a sample from The Notorious B.I.G.'s song ""Sky's The Limit."" The song pays tribute to the late rapper, who is often referred to as ""the greatest of all time"" in the world of hip-hop.

Jozzy's EP has received critical acclaim, with many praising her ability to blend genres and create music that is both fresh and nostalgic. ""Souvenir"" is a testament to Jozzy's talent as a songwriter and vocalist, and it's clear that she has a bright future ahead of her.

In a statement to Billboard, Jozzy spoke about her goals for the future. ""I really want to be known for bringing people together,"" she said. ""I think music is the universal language, and I want to use it to bring positivity and light to the world.""

With her unique sound, powerful lyrics, and collaboration with industry heavyweights like Diddy, Jozzy is poised to become a major force in the music industry. She is a rising star who is not to be missed, and her future looks brighter than ever.",1
20,CNN reporter hit with tear gas during live broadcast,"During a live broadcast on CNN, a reporter was hit with tear gas while covering the ongoing protests in Minneapolis. The incident happened as police officers tried to clear demonstrators from the area.

Omar Jimenez, a reporter for CNN, was broadcasting early on Friday morning when he and his crew were stopped by the police. Despite repeatedly identifying themselves as members of the press, they were faced with forceful action and were told to move along.

As they were complying with the police's instructions, tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd of protesters, and Jimenez and his crew were hit too. Despite the clear markings on his microphone and CNN badge, Jimenez was arrested.

Fellow CNN journalist John Berman, who was anchoring the channel's coverage of the protests, expressed his outrage and disbelief at what he had just witnessed. ""This is really extraordinary. This is an American television reporter being led away by police officers,"" he said.

Since the video of the incident went viral, it has sparked widespread condemnation and criticism of the police's handling of the protests. Journalists across the industry voiced their outrage at the treatment of their colleagues, stating that press freedom is a cornerstone of democracy.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has personally apologized to Jimenez and the other members of his crew for the incident. Speaking at a press conference, he said: ""I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen.""

In recent days, scenes of chaos have unfolded across Minneapolis as protests escalated following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer held him down for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. The incident has reignited national debate and protests against police brutality and racism.",1
21,Record-breaking Kenyan climber wants to advance the sport in his country,"A Kenyan climber has broken new ground for his country, shattering the record for the highest altitude reached by a native climber. Lenny Ngugi, 29, climbed to an altitude of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet), the peak of Mount Everest, earlier this month, setting a new national record.

The climber, who hails from the small town of Nyeri, has set his sights on changing the face of mountaineering in his country. He wants to advance the sport in Kenya and help more locals reach the heights he has.

In an interview with CNN, Ngugi said, ""I hope I can inspire more people to climb, especially from my community. It's a sport that is still new in my country and my goal is to develop the sport so that more Kenyans can experience the thrill of climbing.""

According to Ngugi, mountaineering is an expensive sport that requires a lot of equipment, training and funding, which makes it inaccessible to many Kenyans. However, he believes that with government support, the sport can be developed and made more accessible to a wider audience.

Ngugi's record-breaking achievement has already garnered plenty of attention, and he hopes this will spur more interest in the sport. He also hopes to inspire more representation of Kenyan climbers and mountaineers on the global stage.

""I want to put Kenya on the world map of mountaineering,"" he said. ""I want to show that we have talented climbers who can achieve great things.""",1
22,Expert says not to blame Fed for bank failures. Hear why,"According to financial expert, John Sullivan, the Federal Reserve should not be blamed for the recent bank failures. In an interview with CNN, Sullivan pointed out that banks are accountable for their own lending and investment decisions, and should bear the consequences of their own mistakes.

Although the Fed plays a crucial role in regulating the banking system, Sullivan believes that banks should have the freedom to operate independently and responsibly. He stated that, ""The Fed's job is not to bail out banks. Rather, it is to maintain stability in the financial system and protect consumers.""

The recent failures of major banks such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns have led to widespread criticism of the Fed's policies. However, Sullivan argued that blaming the Fed for these failures is a simplistic view of these complex issues. Instead, he urged banks to learn from their mistakes and ensure that they operate within their means.

Sullivan's analysis offers a valuable perspective on the current state of the banking system. While the Fed must indeed take action to maintain stability, it is ultimately the responsibility of banks to manage their own finances and investments wisely.",1
23,"FDA warns of risk of overheating, fire with some FreeStyle Libre glucose monitors","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about potential risks associated with some models of Abbott Laboratories' FreeStyle Libre glucose monitors, including the risk of overheating and fire.

The FreeStyle Libre, a glucose monitoring system that does not require finger pricks, was approved by the FDA in 2017. However, in a recent safety communication, the agency warned that certain components of some devices may malfunction and cause overheating, which could potentially result in burns or starting a fire.

The affected devices are identified as the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System and the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System Lite. Specifically, the FDA is warning patients and healthcare providers about the models that were manufactured between November 2017 and April 2018.

Abbott has estimated that around 0.2% of the over 700,000 devices sold during that time frame may be affected. The company recently issued a recall of the affected product and has issued a statement urging users to contact customer service to arrange for a replacement device.

In the meantime, the FDA is advising patients to be mindful of the potential risks associated with the affected devices. ""The FDA is concerned that patients may not be aware of the potential risks associated with the use of these devices and may continue to use them without taking appropriate precautions,"" says Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

The warning comes as a shock to many patients who rely on the FreeStyle Libre to monitor their glucose levels, as the device has been widely regarded as a game-changer in the management of diabetes. The system consists of a small sensor that is attached to the back of the upper arm, which can be worn for up to 14 days before it needs to be replaced.

The sensor uses a small filament to measure the sugar levels in the interstitial fluid just under the skin. Unlike traditional glucose monitoring devices, which require users to draw a drop of blood, the FreeStyle Libre collects glucose readings with a simple swipe of the device over the sensor.

Many patients who have used the device have reported significant improvements in their diabetes management, including better control of blood sugar levels and increased quality of life. However, the recent safety concerns have raised questions about the long-term safety of the FreeStyle Libre.

Experts say that while the recent incidents are concerning, patients should not panic. ""The vast majority of FreeStyle Libre users have not had any issues with their devices,"" says Dr. William Cefalu, chief scientific, medical and mission officer of the American Diabetes Association.

However, he adds that patients should still take precautions to ensure their safety. ""If you are a FreeStyle Libre user, it is important to follow the FDA's recommendations and contact Abbott customer service to arrange for a replacement device.""

In light of the recent safety concerns, some healthcare professionals are calling for greater transparency from Abbott about the safety of their products. ""It's essential that companies be proactive about identifying safety concerns and alerting patients and healthcare providers in a timely manner,"" says Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer of the Joslin Diabetes Center.

Others are concerned that the safety issues with the FreeStyle Libre may be indicative of a larger problem within the medical device industry. ""This is not an isolated incident,"" says Dr. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research. ""The medical device industry is notorious for putting profits ahead of patient safety, and it's time for regulators to crack down on their reckless behavior.""

The FDA has noted that it will continue to investigate the safety concerns with FreeStyle Libre devices and will take action as necessary to protect the public's health. In the meantime, patients are urged to be vigilant about the safety of their devices and to contact Abbott customer service to arrange for a replacement if their device is affected by the recent safety concerns.

Overall, the recent safety concerns with FreeStyle Libre devices highlight the need for greater transparency and oversight in the medical device industry. Patients should be able to rely on these devices to manage their conditions safely and effectively, without fear of harm. It is up to regulators and manufacturers alike to ensure that this is the case.",1
24,"Mother of 6-year-old who shot teacher turns herself in on child neglect charge, her attorney says","The heart-wrenching story of a 6-year-old boy accidentally shooting and injuring his first-grade teacher in the Harmony Learning Center in Maplewood, Minnesota, has made headlines across the country. Gun control advocates and opponents are once again at odds, but the latest development in the case has raised questions about parental responsibility.

The boy's mother, identified as 34-year-old Gail Latoya Bassett, turned herself in to authorities on Wednesday, July 11. Bassett is facing charges of child neglect, according to her attorney John Arechigo, who spoke to CNN.

""Bassett is a loving mother who simply made a mistake,"" Arechigo said. ""She is cooperating with authorities and intends to take full responsibility for her actions.""

The incident happened on the morning of Monday, June 4, when the boy brought a loaded gun to school in his backpack. The gun went off and hit first-grade teacher Suzi Ziemke in the shoulder. Ziemke was rushed to the hospital and survived the incident, but authorities say it could have been much worse.

The boy was quickly taken into custody and charged with multiple counts, including second-degree assault and possession of a firearm by a minor. His family has since set up a GoFundMe page to ""raise money for legal fees, counseling, and support for him and his siblings.""

However, it wasn't until two months after the shooting that authorities decided to charge Bassett with child neglect, a charge that could carry a sentence of up to one year in jail and up to $3,000 in fines.

According to a criminal complaint filed in Ramsey County District Court, Bassett ""created an unreasonable risk to the child's safety"" by failing to secure her firearm. The complaint alleges that Bassett knew her son had access to the firearm and had previously seen him playing with it.

""The defendant was aware or should have been aware that her child had the ability to gain access to her firearm,"" the complaint reads. ""She knowingly placed the child in a situation where he had easy access to the firearm and could cause harm to himself or others.""

Following her arrest and release on bail, Bassett spoke to reporters outside the Ramsey County Jail, apologizing for the incident and expressing remorse.

""I am so sorry for what happened, and I take full responsibility for my part,"" Bassett said. ""I should have done more to keep my child safe, and I understand my actions have serious consequences.""

Since the shooting, there has been a renewed debate about gun control and the need for stricter laws to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands. Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton has called for the state legislature to pass ""commonsense gun safety measures,"" including universal background checks and ""red flag"" laws that would allow family members and law enforcement to petition courts to temporarily remove guns from people who pose a danger to themselves or others.

Gun rights advocates, however, argue that the incident should not be used to further restrict Second Amendment rights. The National Rifle Association released a statement saying that ""no law, no matter how well-intentioned, will prevent all future tragedies like this one,"" and that ""the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.""

The incident has also brought attention to the issue of parental responsibility when it comes to firearms. According to a study by Everytown for Gun Safety, at least 4.6 million children in the US live in households with at least one loaded and unlocked firearm. The same study found that 73% of children under the age of 10 who live in homes with firearms know the location of their parents' firearms, and 36% have handled the firearms themselves.

Advocates for stricter gun laws have called for laws that would require firearms to be stored in a locked safe or with a trigger lock, especially in homes with children. Many states have already passed such laws, but enforcement varies widely.

Meanwhile, stories like the one in Maplewood continue to bring attention to the issue of child access to firearms. In February, a 2-year-old boy in Michigan accidentally shot and killed himself with his father's unsecured gun. In 2016, a 3-year-old in Ohio shot and killed himself with his mother's gun that had been left unsecured in her home. And in 2014, a 6-year-old in South Carolina accidentally shot and killed his 9-year-old brother with a gun that their father had left unsecured. 

Arechigo, Bassett's attorney, admitted that parental responsibility is a major concern, but he also argued that there must be a balance between personal responsibility and the right to bear arms.

""Parents must do everything in their power to keep their children safe,"" Arechigo said. ""But we can't forget that we live in a country where the Constitution protects our right to bear arms. We need to find a way to balance these two competing values.""

In the end, whatever the outcome of Bassett's case, it is clear that the incident has brought much-needed attention to the issue of child access to firearms and the need for greater parental responsibility. As legislators, advocates, and parents continue to grapple with this complex issue, one thing is certain: tragedies like the one in Maplewood must never happen again.",1
25,Lady Gaga marks wrap of filming on 'Joker' sequel,"It's a wrap! Lady Gaga has officially finished filming her scenes for the highly-anticipated Joker sequel. Fans of the pop star turned actress have been eagerly awaiting news on her involvement in the upcoming film, and this latest announcement has generated plenty of excitement.

Gaga, who received critical acclaim for her lead role in the 2018 hit A Star is Born, has been tight-lipped about her involvement in the Joker sequel. However, rumors have been circulating for weeks that she had been cast in a significant role in the movie.

The news of Gaga's involvement was confirmed when the official Twitter account of the Joker franchise shared a picture of the pop star on set. In the picture, Gaga can be seen wearing a black dress and a crimson red lip, standing alongside Joaquin Phoenix, who won an Academy Award for his role in the first Joker movie.

The Joker sequel has been highly anticipated since the first film was released in 2019. The movie, directed by Todd Phillips, was a critical and commercial success, earning over $1 billion at the worldwide box office and receiving numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards.

The sequel promises to be just as dark and intense as the first film, focusing on the story of the Joker's rise to power and his battles with Gotham's criminal underworld.

For Gaga, this marks another successful collaboration with Phillips and the film's producer, Bradley Cooper. The trio previously worked together on A Star is Born, which was a huge hit with audiences and critics alike.

There is no word yet on Gaga's exact role in the Joker sequel, but rumors suggest that she will be playing a significant character. Some have speculated that she will be playing a love interest for the Joker, while others have suggested that her character may have connections to Gotham's criminal underworld.

Gaga herself has remained tight-lipped about her involvement in the film, focusing instead on her work as an advocate for mental health awareness. The pop star has been open about her own struggles with mental health, and has used her platform to raise awareness of the issue and encourage others to seek help when they need it.

It's no secret that Gaga is a multi-talented artist, with a successful career in music, film, and fashion. Her ability to immerse herself in each of these different fields has earned her a legion of dedicated fans and admirers, who eagerly await news of her next project.

With the news that Gaga has wrapped filming on the Joker sequel, fans will undoubtedly be even more excited to see what she brings to the table in her next big-screen role.

Gaga's involvement in the film is just one of the many reasons why the Joker sequel is generating so much buzz. The first film was praised for its raw and gritty take on the iconic character, and fans are hoping that the sequel will live up to the expectations set by its predecessor.

In addition to Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the Joker sequel will also feature appearances from several other high-profile actors, including Robert De Niro and Frances Conroy.

While the release date for the film has yet to be announced, fans can rest assured that it will be worth the wait. With an all-star cast, a talented director, and an acclaimed producer, the Joker sequel is sure to be one of the most highly anticipated films of the year.

As for Gaga, it looks like she is continuing to make waves in the film industry, cementing her status as one of Hollywood's most versatile and talented actresses.

While we may not know exactly what her role in the Joker sequel will be, one thing is for certain: Gaga is sure to bring her A-game to the table, delivering a performance that will leave audiences stunned and begging for more.",1
26,"Almost 90% of US mpox-related deaths were in Black men, and nearly all had weakened immune systems, CDC reports","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on communities of color in the United States, with Black Americans accounting for a significant share of both the infections and deaths. A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sheds light on just how severe the toll has been, with almost 90% of COVID-19-related deaths among Black men.

According to the report, which analyzed mortality data from the first six months of the pandemic, Black men were far more likely to die from COVID-19 than any other demographic group. Out of the 51,550 deaths in which race and gender information was available, Black men accounted for 37% of deaths, despite comprising only 6.5% of the population.

The report also found that nearly all of the Black men who died from COVID-19 had underlying health conditions, particularly weakened immune systems. Of the 6,562 Black men who died from COVID-19, nearly 98% had at least one underlying condition, such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, or obesity. These conditions, which disproportionately affect Black communities, can put individuals at increased risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19.

The report underscores the urgent need to address both the racial and health inequities that have fueled the pandemic's devastation in communities of color. It also highlights the need for targeted interventions to protect those who are most vulnerable, particularly Black men who have underlying conditions that put them at higher risk.

""The findings remind us how important it is to address the underlying health conditions that contribute to health disparities and worsen COVID-19 outcomes,"" said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH. ""They also underscore the need to expand access to COVID-19 vaccines for people of color, who have suffered disproportionately from this pandemic.""

The report's findings are particularly alarming given the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. According to data from the CDC, the seven-day average of new cases in the United States has increased by more than 19,000 in the past week, with hotspots emerging in states with low vaccination rates, particularly in the South and Midwest.

Despite the availability of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, many communities of color continue to face barriers to vaccination, including limited access to vaccine sites, misinformation and mistrust, and systemic inequities in healthcare.

To address these disparities, public health officials and community leaders have been working to increase vaccine access and uptake in hard-hit communities. These efforts include opening community vaccination clinics, partnering with trusted community organizations to promote vaccine education and outreach, and addressing concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness through culturally sensitive messaging.

But more needs to be done to ensure that Black men, in particular, receive the information and care they need to stay safe and healthy amid the ongoing pandemic. This includes increased access to testing and treatment for underlying health conditions, as well as targeted vaccine outreach and education campaigns that address the unique barriers to vaccination faced by Black men.

""This pandemic has highlighted the deep-rooted structural and social inequities that exist in our society and have made Black and brown communities disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 and other health crises,"" said Chris Beyrer, MD, MPH, Desmond M. Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""It's critical that we address these inequities head-on and work together to build a healthier and more just society for all.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage communities across the United States, it is clear that much work remains to be done to address the racial and health inequities that have contributed to its devastating toll. But with targeted efforts to address these disparities and prioritize the health and well-being of Black men and other vulnerable populations, there is hope that we can bend the curve and emerge from this crisis stronger and more resilient than ever before.",1
27,"The banking crisis will tilt US into recession, say Fed economists","The United States economy is on a knife's edge. Amidst a steady stream of bleak news, economists within the Federal Reserve are predicting that the country is on the brink of a recession brought upon by a banking crisis. Many factors have contributed to this dire outlook, and if left unchecked, Americans could end up bearing the brunt of their lawmakers’ inaction.

For years now, the regulatory environment for banks has been weakened, and the once watertight safety measures have been eroded. These weak regulations, coupled with risk-taking activities by these financial institutions, have created a perfect storm that is now threatening to capsize the US economy.

Recent events have placed the US banking sector in the spotlight. Bank of America was fined $16.7 billion in 2014 for creating mortgage-backed securities that it knew were toxic. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, and many other major institutions have also been fined for a variety of offenses. Many of these penalties have been large, but they have been dwarfed by the profits that these institutions have made over the years. However, there is evidence that this profitability might not last for long. 

The Fed economists warn that the banking system has significant structural weakness, and this could lead to a major recession if banks started to fail en masse. Derivatives trading, which helped spark the global financial crisis of 2008, continues on an enormous scale, and the underlying assets, such as mortgages and student loans, are now more risky than ever before. Moreover, the shadow banking system has grown larger and more complex, making it increasingly difficult to track risky lending practices.

Perhaps most worrying of all is the fact that the banking system has been connected to the broader economy in a way that it never has before. This means that any collapse in the banking system will have a ripple effect throughout the entire economy: small businesses will suffer, jobs will be lost, and the middle class’s wealth will be eroded, leaving inequality to grow unchecked. 

As the financial markets become more interconnected, it’s difficult to identify which toxic assets are held in which institutions. This lack of transparency is a major issue, and it is essential that Congress works to address it to stave off catastrophe.

The lead up to the 2008 financial crisis saw these symptoms to varying degrees. Banks lent too much money to people who couldn't afford it, and many of these loans were packaged together, sold as investment products, and traded recklessly. This behavior led to a housing bubble that, when it finally burst, left many Americans underwater on their mortgages and caused their homes to be repossessed.

During the crisis, the US government bailed out the banks to the tune of $700 billion to keep them from going under. Despite the anger this sparked amongst the taxpayers, many scholars and journalists argued that these bailouts were necessary to prevent a much more devastating collapse of the global financial system. Bailouts alone, however, won't be sufficient to prevent another potential crisis.

In the last decade, several regulatory measures have been taken up to address the loopholes in the banking system, but few have been implemented. The Dodd-Frank Act, introduced in 2010, was the most sweeping reform of America's financial system since the 1930s. It was designed to prevent another major financial crisis, primarily by establishing regulators to oversee derivatives trading, requiring banks to hold more capital, and preventing the practice of ""too big to fail."" But many of these rules haven't been enacted due to political pressure from the banking industry.

Recently, the Trump administration has been making moves to further erode the protections offered by the Dodd-Frank Act. Instead of bolstering the regulations, they have repealed many of the key provisions that were put in place to protect the economy.

Rolling back the regulations laid out in Dodd-Frank might provide some relief for banks keen on using risky lending practices, like derivatives trading, but it makes the broader economy much more vulnerable. It also makes it much more likely that the US will suffer from the kind of wholesale banking failure that we saw in 2008. 

The current regulatory environment is inadequate, and Congress needs to take action to remedy this. The US government has failed to reform financial regulations significantly over the last ten years, despite legislative attempts like the Dodd-Frank Act. The Fed economists and other financial experts have warned for years that the banking sector is poised to trigger the next economic recession, and this prediction appears to be coming to fruition.

If the regulators do not act soon, then a banking crisis could indeed cause a full-scale recession in the US. The ramifications of this would be felt for years to come, with millions of Americans suffering economic hardship. The financial crisis of 2008 was a wake-up call, but it seems that the lessons it presented have not been learned.

It is time for the US government to act to protect the country's financial security. It must take concrete measures to enforce regulations and ensure that banks do not engage in risk-taking behavior. By doing this, the government can protect the interests of Americans across the economic spectrum and prevent a disaster situation.",1
28,"Veteran lawyer ""surprised"" Fox hasn't already settled $1.6B defamation lawsuit","A veteran lawyer who has been closely following Fox News' ongoing legal battle with Dominion Voting Systems expressed his surprise that the network has not yet settled the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit.

During an interview with CNN, James Goodale, who previously served as vice chairman of The New York Times Company, said that he expected Fox News to quickly settle the lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems earlier this year. The lawsuit alleges that Fox News spread false claims about Dominion's voting machines being used to rig the 2020 presidential election in favor of President Joe Biden.

""It's surprising to me that they haven't settled already,"" Goodale said. ""It's such a straightforward case. Fox was clearly responsible for giving airtime to these false claims about Dominion.""

The lawsuit, which was filed in February, names several Fox News hosts and guests, including Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, and Jeanine Pirro. It alleges that they spread baseless claims about Dominion's voting machines being easily hacked and manipulated.

In recent weeks, several other news organizations, including Newsmax and One America News Network, have settled lawsuits with Dominion over their election coverage. Goodale said that Fox News would be wise to do the same.

""If they settle now, they can limit the damage to their reputation,"" he said. ""The longer they drag this out, the worse it looks for them.""

Fox News has defended its coverage of the 2020 election, saying that it was providing a forum for all sides to be heard. However, the network has also faced criticism from some of its own hosts, including Neil Cavuto and Chris Wallace, who pushed back against claims of election fraud.

The Dominion lawsuit is just one of several legal challenges facing Fox News. The network is also facing a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, another voting technology company, as well as a lawsuit from a former Fox News reporter who alleges that she was sexually harassed by former anchor Ed Henry.",1

30,A Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its shelves is set to consider shutting down its library system,"In a move that has raised eyebrows across the literary world, a Texas county that was recently ordered to return banned books to its shelves is now considering shutting down its entire library system.

The decision has been met with backlash from residents, librarians, and book lovers across the country.

The controversy began when the La Mora County Library, located in a small town just outside of Houston, removed several books from its shelves earlier this year. The books in question included LGBTQ+ themed books and ones that dealt with issues such as race and social justice.

The removal of the books sparked a community-wide debate over censorship, freedom of speech, and the role of libraries in promoting diversity and inclusivity.

The American Library Association (ALA) criticized the move, stating that the removal of books based on their content goes against the fundamental principles of intellectual freedom and free expression.

Following a public outcry, a group of concerned citizens filed a lawsuit against the library system, arguing that the removal of the books was a violation of their First Amendment rights.

In August, a federal judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that La Mora County Library had acted unlawfully in removing the books from its shelves.

In his ruling, Judge Andrew Hanen wrote that ""the First Amendment prohibits public officials from removing materials from a public library because of their content, no matter how well-intentioned their motives may be.""

The judge ordered the library system to return the books to its shelves, and to pay damages to the plaintiffs.

Despite the court's ruling, however, the library system appears unwilling to comply.

In a statement released last week, the library board announced that it was considering shutting down the entire library system, citing financial concerns and a lack of community support.

The decision has been met with outrage from residents and librarians, who argue that such a move would be a drastic overreaction to the situation.

Kayla Martinez, a local resident and frequent library-goer, expressed her frustration to CNN in an interview.

""It's like they're punishing us for wanting access to diverse and inclusive literature,"" she said. ""If they go through with this, it would be a huge loss for our community.""

Many others have also taken to social media to express their concerns, with the hashtag #SaveLaMoraLibrary trending on Twitter.

In response to the backlash, the library board has defended its decision, stating that the costs of maintaining the library system are simply too high.

""We have to be fiscally responsible, and right now, it's just not financially feasible to keep the library system running,"" said board member Robert Johnson in a statement.

But critics question the validity of the board's claims, noting that shutting down the entire library system is an extreme measure that would do more harm than good to the community.

They argue that instead of closing the libraries, the board should work to address the financial concerns in a more measured and responsible way.

""It's clear that there are underlying issues at play here that need to be addressed,"" said ALA President James LaRue in a statement. ""But shutting down the entire library system is not the answer.""

The controversy surrounding La Mora County Library is just the latest in a series of debates over censorship and freedom of speech in public libraries across the country.

In recent years, libraries have come under fire for a variety of reasons, including controversial books, internet filters, and budget cuts.

While libraries have always been at the forefront of intellectual freedom and free speech, the rise of the internet and the increasing polarized political climate has made them an even more vital source of knowledge and information.

In the face of such challenges, it is more important than ever for libraries to remain committed to their core values of free speech and inclusivity.

As Judge Hanen noted in his ruling, ""public libraries have an obligation to provide access to diverse and unpopular ideas, and to promote intellectual freedom and open discourse.""

It is now up to the residents of La Mora County to hold their library board accountable and ensure that these values are upheld in their community.",1
31,"Maryland sheriff and firearms dealer indicted in illegal machine gun acquisition scheme, DOJ says","A Maryland sheriff and a firearms dealer were indicted by the Department of Justice on Wednesday on charges that they illegally purchased and sold machine guns that had been modified to fire automatically.

Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler and firearms dealer Frank James Freeman Jr. are accused of conspiring together to purchase and sell the illegal firearms from July 2018 to October 2020.

According to the indictment, Freeman allegedly modified semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic machine guns, which are illegal to possess without proper licensing under federal and state law. Gahler is accused of knowingly purchasing the illegal firearms and instructing Freeman on how to modify them.

""The indictment alleges that Sheriff Gahler and Mr. Freeman worked together to obtain and sell illegal firearms, including machine guns that had been modified to fire automatically, in violation of federal law,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the DOJ's Civil Division in a statement. ""This prosecution serves as a reminder that no one is above the law and we will hold accountable those who seek to circumvent it.""

According to the indictment, Gahler purchased and possessed at least two of the illegal machine guns, while Freeman allegedly sold at least three of them to undercover agents posing as customers. The guns were allegedly sold for tens of thousands of dollars each.

The indictment also alleges that Gahler had Freeman modify a Glock handgun to make it fully automatic and purchased a silencer from him.

Gahler, who has served as sheriff since 2014, was suspended without pay by the Harford County Executive Barry Glassman after the indictment was announced.

""I have today suspended Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler after receiving notification from the State Prosecutor's Office that criminal charges have been filed against him in Anne Arundel County,"" Glassman said in a statement. ""Harford County government will cooperate fully with this investigation and will provide whatever assistance is requested.""

Gahler's attorney, Robert Bonsib, denied the allegations in a statement to CNN.

""Sheriff Gahler has served and protected the citizens of Harford County for over 30 years with distinction and dedication,"" Bonsib said. ""He denies the allegations in the indictment and looks forward to his day in court to clear his name.""

Freeman was arrested on Wednesday and charged with several offenses, including possession of an unregistered firearm and conspiracy to deal firearms without a license. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

According to the DOJ, the scheme was discovered during a separate investigation into Freeman's firearms business, known as HQL Solutions. The investigation revealed that Freeman was allegedly purchasing firearms at gun shows and using his connections with law enforcement to obtain firearms that were not available to the general public.

The investigation also uncovered evidence that Freeman was allegedly falsifying records to conceal the illegal purchases and sales. He allegedly conducted business with several law enforcement agencies in Maryland, including the Harford County Sheriff's Office.

The indictment alleges that Gahler and Freeman discussed the purchase and sale of the illegal machine guns through text messages and phone calls. They allegedly used code words and phrases to conceal their intentions from law enforcement.

The DOJ emphasized that the charges against Gahler and Freeman do not reflect on the thousands of law enforcement officers who serve their communities with integrity.

""The vast majority of law enforcement officers serve their communities honorably and with great sacrifice,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner of the District of Maryland in a statement. ""The conduct alleged in this case is a betrayal of the trust that we, as citizens, place in our law enforcement officers. It is important that the public has confidence in their law enforcement officials, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that trust is maintained.""

The charges against Gahler and Freeman come amid a nationwide debate over gun control, with President Joe Biden recently announcing a series of executive actions aimed at curbing gun violence.

In a statement released after the announcement, Gahler expressed his opposition to the measures, saying they would not address the root causes of gun violence.

""I stand firm in my belief that illegal firearms and those who use them are the true problem in our society,"" Gahler said. ""I remain committed to pursuing the individuals and criminal enterprises who unlawfully possess and use guns in our communities.""

Gahler is scheduled to appear in court on May 17.",1
32,"Some Philips CPAP, BiPAP machines may not work as intended, FDA says in recall","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a recall for certain Philips Respironics CPAP and BiPAP machines due to potential health risks posed by the devices.

The products, designed to help those with sleep apnea, a disorder that interrupts breathing during sleep, may not work as intended, the FDA warns. The agency adds that the machines are also believed to potentially expose users to harmful chemicals.

In a June 30 announcement, the FDA states that some foam used in the devices' sound-reducing foam may degrade and release particles and gases, which could be harmful if inhaled or ingested.

""The potential risks of particulate exposure include respiratory issues, irritation, inflammation, and toxic or carcinogenic effects,"" the FDA said. ""The potential risks of chemical exposure due to off-gassing include headache, dizziness, irritation, hypersensitivity, nausea/vomiting, and possible toxic and carcinogenic effects.""

According to Philips, the recall is meant to address ""identified potential health risks related to the polyester-based polyurethane (PE-PUR) sound abatement foam component"" in affected devices.

The company says it has already received user reports of headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms associated with potentially inhaling or ingesting foam particles. In rare cases, the foam may also ignite, posing a fire hazard, Philips warns.

The recall affects about 3.5 million machines sold worldwide between 2009 and April 2021, Philips estimated. The company has been the largest manufacturer of CPAP machines in the U.S., according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The affected models include certain DreamStation and SystemOne devices, which fall under Philips' sleep and respiratory care products.

While users who experience symptoms after use have been advised to contact their healthcare providers, the FDA is encouraging all affected individuals to ""consult with their healthcare providers or a medical professional for the most appropriate options for continued treatment.""

Philips is advising customers to discontinue use of affected devices immediately and consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best options for continued treatment.

""We deeply regret any concern and inconvenience that patients using the affected devices will experience because of the proactive measures we are announcing today to ensure patient safety,"" said Philips CEO Frans van Houten in a statement.

The company says it has already begun to address the issue with a planned rollout of a foam replacement program, and that customers can register online to receive a repair or replacement device. Philips has indicated that it plans to prioritize replacement for users with certain medical needs, such as those using the devices in a critical care setting.

The recall has prompted concern from some sleep apnea patients, who say they rely on the devices to help manage their condition.

One user, John Arnold, told CNN that he has been using the DreamStation CPAP machine for three years and was shocked to learn of the recall.

""I'm in a bit of disbelief, to be honest,"" Arnold said. ""I've been using this machine faithfully every night, and you know, it's just such an important medical device for people like myself.""

Arnold called the recall a ""wake-up call"" for CPAP users and urged Philips to act swiftly in addressing the issue.

Another user, Travis Gray, said he has been using a BiPAP machine since 2009 and has yet to experience any issues.

""I've been using it for so long, and I've never had any problems or any symptoms,"" Gray said. ""It's definitely concerning, but I also trust that Philips will take care of it and make it right for their customers.""

The recall also underscores the importance of regular maintenance and inspection of medical devices, experts say.

""Having situate areas or materials that can become dislodged after years of use or from wear and tear on a CPAP or BiPAP machine could pose a significant risk of harm to patients,"" said Dr. Aaron Bunnell, chief medical officer of UCLA Health's division of pulmonary and critical care medicine, in a statement to CNN.

Bunnell added that patients using affected devices should prioritize seeing their healthcare providers and discussing alternative treatments if needed.

The recall comes as medical device safety continues to be a pressing public health issue. In April, a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found that more than 83,000 people have died globally as a result of defective medical devices in the last 10 years.

The report criticized regulatory agencies for their ""failures to regulate adequately the medical device industry and to protect patient safety.""

In response, the FDA has called for greater transparency and collaboration within the medical device industry, as well as stricter regulations and safety standards.

""The FDA remains dedicated to closely monitoring medical devices for safety and effectiveness, taking action when necessary to protect patients, and promoting innovations that improve patient outcomes,"" the agency said in a statement regarding the Philips recall.

For users affected by the recall, the FDA has also released a list of recommended actions, which includes contacting Philips directly and reporting any symptoms to the agency's MedWatch program.

Patients who are particularly concerned about the potential health risks of continuing to use their CPAP or BiPAP machines may want to talk to their doctors about alternative interventions, such as surgery or dental appliances, to manage their sleep apnea.

In the meantime, users like Arnold say they are hopeful that Philips will take responsibility and provide a safe solution for those affected by the recall.

""I'm just hoping that they come up with a plan and that it's something that's not going to cause a lot of disruption or anxiety for people like myself,"" Arnold said. ""I think we all just want a solution that's going to be safe and effective for our health.""",1
33,"WHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low risk","In a newly released advisory, the World Health Organization (WHO) experts have revised their Covid-19 vaccine advice and are now recommending vaccination for healthy kids and teenagers.

The updated guidance comes as more and more countries begin to vaccinate adolescents and some younger children against Covid-19. The WHO's previous recommendation had been to prioritize vaccinating at-risk adults, healthcare workers, and older people worldwide.

At a press briefing held on Friday, the WHO's Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that ""in light of the rapidly evolving evidence, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization has carefully reviewed the evidence for Covid-19 vaccines in children and adolescents.""

He added: ""We recommend the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people aged 12 years and above, and Moderna's vaccine for those 18 and above. We advise that the vaccine be used in the context of the country's national vaccination program, with access provided to children and adolescents who are at high risk of severe Covid-19 or who live in areas of high transmission.""

According to the WHO's updated guidance, children and teenagers who are healthy and without underlying medical conditions face a low risk of severe Covid-19. However, even children who experience mild or no symptoms of the virus could still spread it to others, making vaccination an important public health tool.

The decision to update the advice came as several countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, have already authorized the use of Covid-19 vaccines in children aged 12 and above.

In the US, officials have been working to increase vaccination rates, especially among younger age groups, as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads quickly throughout the country. Last week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted full approval to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for people aged 16 and above, clearing the way for more employers, schools, and universities to require vaccination.

Canada also recently approved the use of Pfizer's vaccine for children aged 12 and over. The country's health agency reported that the vaccine had demonstrated high efficacy and was safe for use in children.

Similarly, the UK has authorized the use of Pfizer's vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 years old, and in the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently recommended extending the use of Pfizer's vaccine to include children aged 12 to 15.

In June, China also approved the use of its Sinovac vaccine for children aged three years and above, while Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has been authorized for use in children aged 12 to 17.

The WHO's updated guidance is expected to prompt many countries that have not yet authorized vaccines for younger age groups to do so.

""For those countries considering vaccinating children and adolescents, the decision should be based on a review of available data and the country's epidemiological situation and vaccine supply,"" said Dr. Alejandro Cravioto, the Chair of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization.

""We urge countries to prioritize vaccinating those at high risk of severe disease and death, and to continue implementing proven public health measures to protect against Covid-19 transmission,"" he added.

The WHO's guidance also calls for monitoring the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children and adolescents continuously, as more data become available.

Critics of the decision argue that children and teenagers face an almost negligible risk from Covid-19 and that the vaccine's potential long-term effects have not been adequately studied. They also point to vaccine hesitancy among parents and the risk of severe side effects, including myocarditis, a rare inflammation of the heart that has been observed in some vaccinated adolescents.

In response, the WHO noted that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people and that vaccinated individuals are less likely to experience serious complications from Covid-19.

""Recommending vaccination of children and adolescents is not only appropriate but essential in controlling the pandemic,"" said Dr. Katherine O'Brien, the Director of the WHO Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals.

She added that it was essential to prioritize the best available evidence, including the significant health, social, and economic benefit of protecting children and adolescents from the impact of the disease.

The WHO's updated vaccine advice also comes as the global death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 4.4 million and cases continue to surge in many parts of the world, including in countries with low vaccination rates.

According to data from WHO's Covid-19 Dashboard, over 212 million cases have been reported globally since the outbreak began, with 5.5 million new cases reported in the week ending August 22.

""The pandemic is far from over, and it is critical that we continue to take action to slow the spread of the virus and protect the most vulnerable,"" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

""The WHO remains committed to working with all countries to accelerate the equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics to save lives and stem the impact of Covid-19,"" he added.

Overall, the WHO's updated guidance represents a significant development in the fight against Covid-19 and a vital step towards curbing the pandemic's spread. As more countries expand their vaccination programs to include younger age groups, global efforts to control the outbreak will be strengthened, bringing us one step closer to a post-pandemic world.",1
34,Doctor explains new over-the-counter medicine that's a 'complete antidote to opioids',"A new over-the-counter medicine could offer a solution to the opioid crisis that has gripped the United States. Dr. Jane Smith, a leading authority on addiction and pain management, claims that the new medicine is a ""complete antidote to opioids.""

The medicine, called Opioid-Block, contains a unique combination of vitamins and minerals that have been shown to reduce the brain's response to opioid receptors. By doing so, the medicine can help to reduce the effects of opioid addiction and withdrawal.

""We have been searching for a safe, effective, and affordable solution to the opioid crisis for years,"" Dr. Smith said. ""And I believe that Opioid-Block is that solution.""

The medicine is available over-the-counter and requires no prescription. It is also relatively affordable, with a typical monthly supply costing around $50.

Dr. Smith says that the medicine is safe and non-addictive, and it can be taken by anyone who is trying to overcome opioid addiction. She recommends taking the medicine once a day, in conjunction with other treatments such as counseling and group therapy.

""The road to recovery is a long and difficult one, but I truly believe that Opioid-Block can be a powerful tool to help people overcome their addiction,"" she said.

While there is still much to learn about Opioid-Block and its potential effects, early tests have been promising. If further research confirms its effectiveness, it could be a vital tool in the fight against opioid addiction.",1
35,Ben Affleck speaking fluent Spanish is tripping people out,"Actor, director, and producer Ben Affleck has been in the spotlight for many reasons over the years. He's won awards for his work in the entertainment industry, been the center of countless rumors and controversies, and even played Batman in a few blockbuster films. However, recently Affleck has been making headlines for a different reason altogether: his fluency in Spanish.

Affleck was recently filmed speaking Spanish during an interview with Univision, a popular Spanish-language television network in the United States. This brief clip, which has since gone viral on social media, shows Affleck speaking effortlessly and fluently in the language, which has impressed and tripped many people out.

It's not that Affleck's ability to speak Spanish is a total shock to those who know and follow him. He spent some of his childhood in Mexico and has previously demonstrated that he has some level of proficiency in the language. However, it's the extent of his fluency that has people surprised, and some have even expressed disbelief.

Twitter has, predictably, been flooded with tweets about Ben Affleck and his Spanish skills. Some users have praised him for being able to speak the language so well, while others have been more skeptical or just downright confused.

One user, @amandabellerr, wrote: ""Can we just talk about how Ben Affleck is out here speaking fluent Spanish and I’m struggling to remember even basic grammar rules."" Another user, @JuiceboxP, tweeted, ""Just found out that Ben Affleck is fluent in Spanish, I’m genuinely shocked.""

Overall, though, the reaction to Affleck's language skills has generally been positive. It's an unexpected surprise for many, and it's certainly impressive to see someone speak another language so seamlessly.

But why is this getting so much attention? There are a few reasons.

First, the fact that Affleck is speaking Spanish specifically is noteworthy. While Spanish is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, it's not commonly seen as something that most Americans (even those in the entertainment industry) are particularly proficient in. That's starting to change, though, as more people in the U.S. are learning Spanish as a second language (or third, or fourth…). But the fact that Affleck is an award-winning actor who's generally seen as being ""typically American"" makes his Spanish-speaking abilities more surprising and noteworthy.

Second, there's a certain fascination people have with celebrities who speak another language. We've seen this before with actors like Bradley Cooper (who speaks French fluently) or Mila Kunis (who speaks both Russian and Spanish). There's something intriguing and exotic about seeing someone who is already famous and successful demonstrate that they have even more skills and talents than we realized. It's like an added bonus, and it helps us feel like we're getting to know the celebrity on a more personal level.

Finally, there's a certain degree of novelty to seeing someone speak another language fluently. It's impressive enough to speak multiple languages even if you're not famous, but when someone like Ben Affleck – a Hollywood superstar – does it, it's even more unexpected. It's kind of like seeing a shark walk on land – it's not something you see every day, and it's thrilling to witness.

Of course, there are some who are less impressed with Affleck's language skills. Some on social media have pointed out that there are plenty of people who speak Spanish fluently and it's not that big of a deal. Others have joked that Affleck's pronunciation or grammar might not actually be that great (though most comments seem to suggest that his Spanish is quite good).

Regardless of how you feel about it, there's no doubt that Ben Affleck speaking fluent Spanish is tripping some people out. It's a fun reminder that even the most famous celebrities have skills and talents that we might not know about. It's also a reminder that learning another language is always a valuable and impressive thing to do, even if you're not a movie star.",1
36,Louisiana state troopers involved in deadly Ronald Greene arrest plead not guilty,"Three Louisiana State Troopers recently pleaded not guilty after being indicted on charges related to the 2019 arrest and subsequent death of Ronald Greene, a Black motorist. The officers, who were not originally charged, were indicted last month by a federal grand jury.

The charges include counts of deprivation of rights under color of law, which can carry sentences ranging from life in prison to the death penalty.

The case has garnered national attention since body camera footage was released earlier this year, showing Greene being tased and beaten by troopers during a traffic stop. Greene died in police custody, and initial reports claimed he was killed in a car crash following the chase.

However, the video footage painted a different picture, leading to intense scrutiny of the police officers involved and calls for justice.

In response to the charges and pleas, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards issued a statement, saying, ""These are serious charges that will be pursued rigorously. We must ensure justice is served for Ronald Greene, his family, and the people of Louisiana.""

The three indicted officers, Daniel J. Butler, Chris Hollingsworth, and Kory York, were all present during Greene's arrest and have since been placed on administrative leave by the Louisiana State Police.

Hollingsworth died in a single-vehicle crash last year, just weeks after acknowledging in an audio recording that he had beaten Greene and ""choked him and everything else trying to get him under control.""

York and Butler are currently free on bond, and their attorneys have maintained their innocence.

Speaking to reporters after their pleas, York's attorney John McLindon said, ""We're not going to try this case in the press. We're going to wait and see what the evidence shows.""

Butler's attorney, Donald Cazayoux Jr., also emphasized that his client was ""presumed innocent until proven guilty"" and that they would be fighting the charges in court.

Greene's family and civil rights groups have been critical of the state's response to the case, accusing officials of a cover-up and demanding more transparency.

In a statement released last month, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund stated, ""This indictment… is a long-overdue step toward accountability for Mr. Greene's death, yet it falls far short of what is necessary to address the systemic racism and brutality that plagues Louisiana law enforcement.""

The organization called on federal officials to launch an independent investigation into the state police department and the circumstances surrounding Greene's death.

Louisiana has a long and troubling history of police brutality and discrimination against Black people. Recent incidents involving police officers targeting protesters and using excessive force have added fuel to the fire of activists and community leaders demanding change.

In the wake of last year's protests against police violence and racism, Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill banning chokeholds and other forms of excessive force by police officers.

However, many activists argue that more fundamental changes are necessary to address the root causes of police violence and reform law enforcement practices.

As the case moves forward, there remains a great deal of uncertainty and tension in the community. The fate of the officers involved, as well as the larger issue of police accountability, continues to be a topic of intense debate and discussion.

However, one thing is clear: the death of Ronald Greene was a tragedy that has exposed deep flaws within the criminal justice system and highlighted the urgent need for reform.

As Louisiana continues to grapple with the aftermath of the arrest and death of Ronald Greene, communities across the country are watching closely and demanding answers. The fight for justice and accountability for all victims of police violence remains an ongoing struggle, and the outcome of this case is sure to have far-reaching implications for the future of law enforcement in Louisiana and beyond.",1
37,Russian warships conduct anti-submarine exercises in Asian waters,"Russian warships conducted anti-submarine exercises in the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean, as tensions rise between various regional powers, including China, Japan, and the United States.

The exercises, which were carried out by the Russian Pacific Fleet, involved multiple vessels, including the Admiral Panteleyev destroyer, the Admiral Vinogradov destroyer, and the large anti-submarine ship Admiral Tributs. According to a statement from the Russian Defense Ministry, the exercises were designed to test the ships' abilities to detect and track submarines, as well as to practice anti-submarine warfare tactics.

The exercises come at a time of increased naval activity in the region, with the United States deploying multiple carrier strike groups to the area in recent weeks, as well as conducting joint exercises with allies including Japan and South Korea. China, meanwhile, has been increasing its naval presence in the South China Sea, where it claims disputed territories and has built military installations on artificial islands.

Japan, which is a key ally of the United States in the region, has also been stepping up its defense capabilities, with plans to deploy F-35A fighter jets and rerouting a destroyer to the South China Sea in response to China's actions.

The Russian exercises have been viewed by some experts as a sign of Russia's growing military ambitions in the region, as well as a signal to China that Russia is willing to challenge the United States in the region.

""This is a clear indication that Russia is interested in expanding its military presence and influence in the Asia-Pacific region,"" said William Choong, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore. ""By conducting these exercises, Russia is demonstrating that it is willing to work closely with China, its strategic partner, but also prepared to push back against American influence.""

The exercises also come amid ongoing tensions between Russia and the United States, with both sides accusing each other of engaging in aggressive behavior in various parts of the world. The United States has accused Russia of meddling in its elections and is currently imposing sanctions on the country, while Russia has accused the United States of trying to provoke conflict in Ukraine and Syria.

The exercises were not the first time that Russian warships have ventured into Asian waters. In 2016, a Russian carrier strike group sailed through the South China Sea, raising concerns among regional powers. However, the current exercises are seen as more significant, given the larger number of ships involved and the focus on anti-submarine warfare.

Experts point out that submarines are becoming an increasingly important tool for modern navies, especially in the contested waters of the South China Sea, where countries are seeking to gain an edge over their rivals. Submarines are difficult to detect and can carry out a range of missions, including surveillance, intelligence gathering, and attacks on enemy vessels.

""The anti-submarine exercises demonstrate Russia's intention to expand its naval presence in the region and the potential challenge it poses to China's claims,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center in Washington, D.C. ""Submarines have emerged as an important tool for countries seeking to control the seas and exercise power in the region. By honing its anti-submarine capabilities, Russia is sending a message that it is willing to compete in this arena.""

The exercises also highlight Russia's growing military capabilities, especially in the naval sphere. In recent years, Russia has invested heavily in its navy, modernizing its fleet with new ships and submarines and improving its training and tactics.

The Russian navy has been active in various parts of the world in recent years, including the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, as part of what Russian officials describe as a broader effort to protect the country's interests and project power abroad.

Despite Russia's growing military prowess, some experts caution against seeing the country as a major player in the region, arguing that its military capabilities remain limited compared to those of China and the United States.

""Russia is certainly looking to increase its presence in the region, but it faces significant challenges, especially when it comes to funding and infrastructure,"" said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""China and the United States both have much larger navies and greater regional influence, and Russia cannot hope to challenge them directly.""

Despite these challenges, the exercises are seen as a sign of Russia's determination to play a larger role in the Asia-Pacific region, where it sees opportunities to expand its influence and challenge the dominance of the United States and its allies.

As tensions continue to rise in the South China Sea and the wider region, the exercises serve as a reminder of the growing importance of naval power in the 21st century, as well as the competition between great powers for control of key strategic areas.

""The exercises show that the Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly contested, with multiple powers seeking to assert their influence and protect their interests,"" said Choong. ""The challenge now is to manage these tensions and prevent conflict from breaking out, whether through diplomacy or more robust military deterrence measures.""",1

39,Man accused of stabbing imam at New Jersey mosque pleads not guilty to attempted murder charge,"On January 16th, a disturbing incident occurred at the mosque in New Jersey when an imam was stabbed. Following the event, a man was soon arrested and charged with attempted murder. Now, in a recent update, the accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge, and the case is set to go to trial.

The incident took place at the Dar-ul-Islah mosque in Teaneck, where a man identified as Anthony Graziano allegedly approached the victim, Imam Mohamed Qatanani, and stabbed him multiple times in the neck with a four-inch folding knife. The attack happened during afternoon prayers while the imam was standing at the podium delivering a sermon.

The attack on Imam Qatanani sent shockwaves through the Muslim community in New Jersey, with many expressing their concern about the rise in hate crimes against them. Qatanani has long been an advocate for peaceful coexistence between the Muslim community and other faiths, and the attack on him was seen as a direct assault on those efforts.

Following the attack, Qatanani was rushed to Hackensack University Medical Center, where he underwent surgery to treat the injuries he sustained. Though the imam was left with significant injuries, he eventually made a full recovery and was able to return to his duties at the mosque.

As news of the attack spread, authorities worked tirelessly to investigate and apprehend those involved. Following the incident, Graziano was quickly identified as a suspect, and he was later arrested and charged with attempted murder.

Graziano was arraigned on Friday, February 12th, where he pleaded not guilty to the charge. The hearing was conducted virtually due to COVID-19 restrictions, with Graziano appearing via a video conference from a jail in the Hudson County. During the arraignment, Graziano spoke very briefly, only stating that he understood the charges against him.

The accused's defense attorney, Michael Orozco, requested for Graziano's release from jail on the grounds that the state had not shown sufficient evidence to keep him detained. However, Judge Adam Jacobs denied the request, citing the severity of the charges against Graziano.

The judge also denied a motion from the prosecution to increase his bail amount of $750,000, which had already been posted by Graziano's family. The prosecution had argued that Graziano, who has a history of mental health issues, posed a danger to society and was a flight risk.

Despite the defense's efforts to claim Graziano's lack of mental stability, prosecutors have said that they believe the attack was fueled by ethnic and religious biases. Paul DeGroot, the assistant Bergen County prosecutor handling the case, stated that Graziano had a history of making anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant remarks on social media.

Graziano had been previously charged with bias crimes, but he was not convicted of those charges. Prosecutors argue that his previous actions show a pattern of discriminatory behavior, which may have been the motive behind the stabbing at the mosque.

While the case has yet to go to trial, the not-guilty plea from Graziano has come as a shock to many in the Muslim community. The incident at the mosque has left many feeling violated and scared, and they worry about the rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes in recent years.

In a statement to the media, the Dar-ul-Islah mosque expressed disappointment in Graziano's plea but remained optimistic that justice would be served. ""We believe that the legal system will do the right thing and hold the accused accountable for his actions,"" the statement read.

The mosque also expressed gratitude and appreciation for the law enforcement agencies who swiftly acted to apprehend the suspect and bring him to justice. The statement noted that the quick response helped prevent further harm and allowed the community to begin the healing process.

The attack on Imam Qatanani has also sparked discussions about the importance of interfaith dialogue and the need for more outreach between different faith communities. Many religious leaders from various faith traditions have come forward to offer their support and solidarity with the Muslim community in the wake of the incident.

In a statement, the Interfaith Brotherhood Sisterhood (IBS), a group that promotes interfaith understanding and dialogue, expressed their concern about the rise in hate crimes and urged people to come together to fight against such bigotry. ""We cannot let hate divide us. We must come together to show that we stand for peace and inclusiveness,"" the statement read.

The IBS has also planned a series of events to bring different faith communities together to discuss issues relating to interfaith cooperation and understanding. Such efforts have been praised by many in the Muslim community who believe that such conversations are necessary to prevent similar hate crimes from occurring in the future.

The case against Graziano is expected to go to trial in the coming months. The accused faces up to life in prison if convicted on the attempted murder charge. The trial is likely to garner a significant amount of attention, particularly from members of the Muslim community who have been impacted by the attack.

For them, the trial represents more than just a legal proceeding. It is a chance for justice to be served, for their voices to be heard, and for their concerns about the rise of hate crimes to be addressed at the highest levels. As Imam Qatanani has said, ""We must remain vigilant and work together to ensure that our communities remain safe and secure for people of all faiths.""",1

41,Celine Dion announces new music amid her health battle,"Celine Dion has been a force in the music industry for decades, captivating audiences with her powerful voice and emotional performances. However, in recent years, she has faced a different kind of battle: her health.

In 2016, Dion lost her husband, René Angélil, to throat cancer. Shortly after, she announced that she, too, had been diagnosed with the condition, forcing her to cancel several shows and take a break from her music career to focus on her health.

But on Thursday, the beloved singer announced that she is preparing to release new music that she hopes will inspire her fans and offer them hope during these difficult times.

""I'm excited to announce that I'll be releasing new music very soon and I can't wait for you to hear it,"" Dion said in a statement. ""Music has always been my passion and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to share my voice and my stories with the world.""

Dion's announcement comes at a time when the world is still grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. With many people struggling to cope with isolation, financial uncertainty, and health issues, Dion's upcoming music could offer a much-needed source of comfort and inspiration.

""I know that times are tough right now, and many of us are facing challenges that we never could have imagined,"" Dion said. ""But I hope that my music can help to lift your spirits and remind you that we're all in this together.""

While Dion has not revealed many details about the new music she is preparing to release, she has hinted that it will be deeply personal and reflective of her own experiences.

""Over the past few years, I've been through a lot,"" Dion said. ""From losing my husband to battling cancer, it's been a difficult journey. But through it all, music has been my constant companion. It's helped me to heal, to find peace, and to keep going when things seem impossible.""

Dion's fans have been eagerly anticipating her return to music, and her announcement has already generated a great deal of excitement and support on social media.

""Can't wait to hear what Celine has been working on!"" one fan tweeted in response to the news. ""Her music has always been a source of hope and inspiration for me.""

Another fan echoed these sentiments, writing, ""Celine's voice is like a warm hug for the soul. I can't wait to hear what she has in store for us.""

While Dion's health battle has undoubtedly been challenging, she has remained optimistic and resilient throughout the process. In a recent interview with People magazine, she spoke about the importance of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of adversity.

""I believe that we have the power to choose our own attitudes and reactions, no matter what life throws our way,"" Dion said. ""Of course, there are times when it's hard to stay positive, but I always try to focus on the things that bring me joy and gratitude.""

For Dion, one of those things has always been her music. Over the course of her career, she has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, earning her the title of one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

But for Dion, success has always been about more than just record sales or chart-topping singles. Instead, she has always focused on the deeper emotional connection that music can create between artist and listener.

""Music has always been my way of expressing myself and connecting with others,"" Dion said. ""When I sing, I'm not just performing for an audience. I'm sharing a piece of myself, and inviting others to join me in that space.""

As Dion prepares to release her new music, she hopes that it will provide a sense of comfort and community for her fans, especially during these difficult times.

""Music has the power to bring people together, even when we're apart,"" Dion said. ""I hope that my new music can offer a sense of hope and inspiration to those who need it most, and remind us all that we are stronger together than we could ever be alone.""",1
42,What someone with an eating disorder wishes you knew,"What Someone with an Eating Disorder Wishes You Knew

Eating disorders are a complex and often misunderstood mental illness that affect millions of individuals around the world. In fact, according to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), an estimated 20 million women and 10 million men in the United States alone will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. Despite its prevalence, eating disorders remain stigmatized and misunderstood. 

For those who have never experienced it, it can be difficult to understand how it feels to live with an eating disorder. However, those who have firsthand experience with these conditions want you to know that there is much more to the illness than just the physical behaviors associated with restrictive eating, bingeing, and purging. 

To help broaden our understanding, we spoke to individuals who have struggled with eating disorders and asked them what they wish more people understood about these illnesses. Here are the insights they shared.

Eating disorders are not just about food 

Many people wrongly assume that eating disorders are solely about food, calories and losing weight, but in reality, food is just a symptom of a much deeper issue. An eating disorder is often driven by psychological and emotional factors that can include low self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and trauma. 

An eating disorder can also be used as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, emotional pain or trauma. Strict control over eating can provide a sense of predictability and order in a world that feels otherwise chaotic and unpredictable.

“I was never just obsessed with food or losing weight, but instead it was a way for me to feel in control when everything else felt out of control in my life,” says Ava* who struggled with anorexia for five years. “It was a way for me to numb out the chaos and uncertainty in my life and feel like I had control over something.”

Eating disorders come in many forms 

Eating disorders do not discriminate based on gender, age, or body type, and can manifest in a variety of ways. There are four primary types of eating disorders: Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED). 

Anorexia Nervosa is characterized by restricted food intake, severe weight loss and a distorted body image. Those with this disorder may also engage in excessive exercise.

Bulimia Nervosa involves episodes of binge-eating followed by purging, fasting, or excessive exercise.

Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by episodes of overeating followed by feelings of shame, guilt and a lack of control. Those with BED do not typically engage in purging.

OSFED is a category used to describe disorders that do not fit cleanly into the other three categories. It can include conditions such as atypical anorexia, night-eating syndrome and purging disorder.

Myth: You can tell that someone has an eating disorder just by looking at them

Reality: Eating disorders are not always visible. Individuals of all shapes and sizes can suffer from an eating disorder. However, society often associates eating disorders with being thin. This can result in a lack of support and recognition for those who do not fit this stereotype.

Carly* struggled with binge eating disorder but was not taken seriously by doctors because of her weight. She says: “I was overweight when I developed my eating disorder, so for years I didn’t think I deserved help or support because I didn’t look like someone who had an eating disorder. It wasn’t until my symptoms got so severe that I needed medical help that I was finally diagnosed.""

Eating disorders can be triggered by various factors 

Eating disorders can be triggered by a variety of factors, including social media, trauma, family history, societal pressures, and genetics. However, there is no single cause of eating disorders, and it can be challenging to pinpoint why one person may develop an eating disorder while another may not.

For some individuals, a traumatic event or difficult transition can trigger the onset of an eating disorder. For others, societal pressures to look a certain way, such as those perpetuated by social media, can lead to unhealthy behaviors around food and body image.

Additionally, genetics may also play a role in the development of eating disorders. According to NEDA, studies have identified specific genes that are associated with an increased risk for developing an eating disorder.

Recovery from an eating disorder is possible 

Recovery from an eating disorder is possible, but it's a complex and difficult process. It often requires treatment from a team of professionals, including therapists, dietitians, and medical doctors, and it can be a lengthy process that involves both physical and emotional healing.

“I’ve been in recovery for two years, and it’s been the hardest but also the most rewarding challenge of my life,” says Emily* who struggled with bulimia for nine years. “It takes a lot of work and support, but over time you begin to heal and realize that there is more to life than constantly thinking about food and your body.”

What can we do to support those struggling with eating disorders? 

The first step in supporting those who are struggling with eating disorders is to educate ourselves on the complexities of the illness. It is not enough to rely on stereotypes and assumptions about what eating disorders look like. Rather, we must listen to the experiences of those who have struggled and incorporate their perspectives into our understanding.

Additionally, it's important to become an ally to those struggling with eating disorders, rather than someone who inadvertently stigmatizes or further harms them. This means offering support and understanding, rather than judgment and shame.

If you are concerned about someone you love, offer to help them find professional support and treatment. Do not try to force someone to recover or blame them for their condition.

Finally, it is essential to remember that recovery from an eating disorder is possible, but it requires compassion, patience, and dedication. The road to recovery may be long and difficult, but it is possible with the right guidance and support.

Conclusion

Those who have experienced an eating disorder understand that there is much more to the illness than the physical symptoms. Eating disorders are complex conditions that require a nuanced and compassionate understanding to overcome. By listening to the experiences of those who have struggled with eating disorders and being a supportive ally, we can help create a more compassionate and informed society where those who are suffering can receive the support and care they deserve.",1
43,"About 100,000 nurses left the workforce due to pandemic-related burnout and stress, survey finds","About 100,000 nurses have left the healthcare workforce due to pandemic-related burnout and stress, according to a new survey conducted by the American Nurses Association (ANA) and other nursing organizations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has put a tremendous strain on the healthcare system and placed a heavy burden on healthcare workers, especially nurses, who are often on the front lines of patient care. Over the past year and a half, nurses have been working tirelessly to care for patients with COVID-19, often putting their own health and safety at risk.

However, the strain has taken a toll on nurses' mental health, with many experiencing burnout, anxiety, depression, and other forms of stress-related illness. The survey aimed to shed light on the extent of the problem and provide insights into how to deal with it.

The survey gathered responses from more than 22,000 nurses across the United States, providing valuable insights into their mental health and work conditions. The findings showed that nurses are struggling with a range of mental health issues related to the pandemic, including burnout, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

According to the survey, almost half of the nurses (49%) reported feeling burnt out, while almost a third (31%) reported experiencing anxiety or depression. Moreover, over a fifth of the nurses (22%) reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD, which can have a profound and long-lasting impact on mental health and wellbeing.

The survey also highlighted the significant impact of the pandemic on the nursing workforce, with nearly one in five nurses (18%) reporting that they had left the workforce entirely or scaled back their hours due to pandemic-related stress and burnout. When extrapolated to the entire nursing workforce in the U.S., this translates to an estimated 100,000 nurses leaving the workforce.

The ANA and other nursing organizations are calling for immediate action to address the mental health and wellbeing of nurses, who are crucial to the delivery of high-quality patient care. They are calling for increased investment in mental health services for nurses, including counseling, emotional support, and other forms of assistance to help them cope with the stresses of the pandemic.

The survey also highlighted the need for structural changes in healthcare systems to support nurses in their work. These include reducing nurse-to-patient ratios, increasing flexibility in work schedules, and addressing the root causes of workplace stress and burnout.

The ANA has released a statement calling for urgent action to address the mental health and wellbeing of nurses, highlighting the critical importance of supporting these essential workers during the pandemic and beyond.

""Nurses are the backbone of our healthcare system, and their health and wellbeing are essential to the delivery of high-quality patient care,"" said Ernest Grant, President of the ANA. ""We must take immediate action to address the mental health challenges of nurses, who have been working tirelessly to care for patients during the pandemic. We need increased investment in mental health services and structural changes in healthcare systems to ensure that nurses can continue to do their vital work.""

Nursing leaders across the country have also voiced their concern over the impact of the pandemic on the nursing workforce. They have called for greater recognition of the contributions of nurses and for increased support and resources to help them cope with the stresses of the pandemic.

""Over the past year and a half, nurses have been working under incredibly stressful conditions, often risking their own health and safety to care for patients with COVID-19,"" said Sheila Davis, CEO of Partners in Health, a global health organization. ""They have shown incredible resilience and dedication, but we need to do more to support them. We need to provide them with the resources they need to manage their mental health and wellbeing, reduce their workloads, and recognize their contributions to our healthcare system.""

The pandemic has also highlighted the critical need to address long-standing issues in the nursing profession, including the shortage of nurses, the need for greater diversity and inclusion, and the need for increased investment in nursing education. These issues are essential to ensuring that nurses can continue to provide high-quality patient care and meet the healthcare needs of communities across the country.

The ANA and other nursing organizations are calling on policymakers, healthcare leaders, and the general public to take action to support nurses during the pandemic and beyond. They are urging healthcare systems to implement evidence-based practices that promote nurse wellbeing, including reducing workloads, offering training and support to manage stress, and increasing access to mental health services.

""We need to recognize the critical importance of nurses during this pandemic and beyond,"" said Pamela Cipriano, Dean of the School of Nursing at the University of Virginia. ""They are the ones at the bedside, providing critical care to patients and supporting their families. We need to do everything we can to support them during these challenging times.""

In conclusion, the ANA survey finds that almost 100,000 nurses have left the healthcare workforce due to pandemic-related stress and burnout. The survey highlights the need for urgent action to promote the mental health and wellbeing of nurses, including increased investment in mental health services and structural changes in healthcare systems to support nurses in their work. The pandemic has brought the critical role of nurses in healthcare delivery to the forefront, highlighting the need to address long-standing issues in the nursing profession to ensure that nurses can continue to provide high-quality patient care in the future.",1
44,Drugmakers sign letter supporting FDA and calling for reversal of Texas judge's mifepristone ruling,"In light of recent events, drugmakers have come forward to support the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its decision to allow mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, to be prescribed via telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. This comes after Texas judge Lee Yeakel ruled in July that a ban on abortions due to COVID-19 could potentially release more hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, which led to a ban on abortions in Texas, including those performed with mifepristone.

The FDA has supported the use of mifepristone for abortion since 2000 when it approved the drug for use up to 70 days after the start of the last menstrual period. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA stated in a letter to healthcare professionals in March that it would not enforce the requirement for patients to receive the pill in person at a healthcare clinic or hospital. The decision came as a way to limit patient exposure to the virus.

However, Judge Yeakel’s decision overturned this ruling, stating that the decision to ban abortions was within the state’s power to regulate healthcare procedures. The decision was then upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court refused to intervene.

Now, in a statement to CNN Business, multiple pharmaceutical companies, including Bayer, which produces the abortion pill, have signed a letter supporting the FDA and calling for the reversal of Judge Yeakel's ruling. The letter states that ""we support the FDA's decision to temporarily relax the FDA-approved regimen for mifepristone to allow providers to prescribe the medicine by telehealth and mail delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic for the safety of patients and healthcare providers.""

The letter also states that the ruling in Texas is “harmful to both patients and healthcare providers” and argues that telemedicine can help ensure that those seeking an abortion have timely access to care.

The letter was organized by the Center for Reproductive Rights and signed by 22 pharmaceutical and advocacy groups, including the National Women's Health Network, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

The decision by these pharmaceutical companies to speak out in support of the FDA is significant as it highlights the importance of access to reproductive healthcare, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has underscored the importance of telemedicine as a vital resource for healthcare practitioners and patients alike, and this decision could potentially have a ripple effect on other healthcare decisions in the future.

However, this decision is not without controversy. Pro-life groups, such as the American Life League, have spoken out against the decision, stating that it promotes the “culture of death,” and that abortions should be banned altogether. They argue that the decision by the FDA to allow telemedicine for the administration of mifepristone violates the principles of medical ethics and puts women's health at risk.

Despite these criticisms, the letter signed by Bayer and other drugmakers and advocacy groups is a significant win for those fighting for access to reproductive healthcare. It highlights the importance of telemedicine as a way to increase access to care, particularly during a pandemic, and underscores the need for continued advocacy for access to essential healthcare services.

The decision by Judge Yeakel to ban the use of mifepristone during the pandemic was particularly harmful to women in Texas, as it denied them the ability to access a safe and medically sound procedure. This decision, combined with the defunding of Planned Parenthood clinics across the state, has had devastating consequences for women who rely on these essential services.

The reversal of this decision would provide women in Texas and across the country with greater access to reproductive healthcare, allowing them to make choices about their bodies and their future. This is particularly imperative during a pandemic, where access to healthcare is more critical than ever before.

It is also important to note that the decision by Bayer and other drugmakers to sign this letter is not a statement simply in favor of abortion. Instead, it is a statement in favor of patients and healthcare providers, recognizing the importance of telemedicine as a way to increase access to essential healthcare services.

The decision by the FDA to allow telemedicine for the administration of mifepristone during the pandemic is a critical step in ensuring that women across the country have access to essential reproductive healthcare services. It is imperative that this decision is upheld and expanded upon, as access to healthcare is a fundamental right that must be protected.

It is also important to note that access to reproductive healthcare is not a political issue; it is a healthcare issue. Women across the country rely on access to abortion services as an essential part of their healthcare, and denying them this care puts their health and well-being at risk.

The decision by Bayer and other drugmakers to sign the letter in support of the FDA is a statement in support of women's healthcare and human rights. This decision sends a powerful message to politicians and policymakers that access to reproductive healthcare is a fundamental right that must be protected.

In conclusion, the decision by drugmakers to sign the letter in support of the FDA’s decision to allow telemedicine for the administration of mifepristone during the pandemic is a significant win for women's healthcare rights. It highlights the importance of access to essential healthcare services during a pandemic and sends a powerful message to policymakers that access to reproductive healthcare is a fundamental right that must be protected. The reversal of Judge Yeakel's ruling in Texas would provide women with greater access to reproductive healthcare, allowing them to make choices about their bodies and their future. It is imperative that we continue to advocate for access to essential healthcare services, particularly during a pandemic when access is more critical than ever before.",1
45,"There were 32,000 fewer legal abortions in the US in the six months after the Dobbs decision, new analysis suggests","In December 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a landmark ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overturning a lower court ruling that had blocked a Mississippi law banning almost all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

While the fallout from this decision is still being felt nationwide, early indications suggest a significant drop in the number of legal abortions performed in the six months following the decision.

According to new analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, a prominent reproductive rights research organization, there were approximately 32,000 fewer legal abortions performed in the US between December 2021 and May 2022 than there would have been in the absence of the Dobbs decision.

While this figure only accounts for a six-month period and is subject to limitations due to data availability, it is nonetheless a concerning trend for those who support the right to choose.

Here's what we know about the decline in legal abortions since the Dobbs decision and what it could mean for the future of reproductive rights in the US.

Understanding the Dobbs Decision

Before diving into the analysis, it's important to understand what exactly the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision entailed.

The Mississippi law at issue in the case, known as the Gestational Age Act, banned nearly all abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with limited exceptions for medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities. The law was signed by Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2018 but was immediately challenged by the state's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization.

Lower courts blocked the law from taking effect, citing the Supreme Court's 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide. The Roe decision established a constitutional right to abortion up to the viability of the fetus, usually around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

However, in June 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Dobbs case, signaling a potential shakeup in abortion rights jurisprudence. And in December 2021, the court ultimately upheld the Mississippi law, ruling that states have the right to ban abortions before fetal viability.

What this Means for Abortion Access

The Dobbs decision marks a significant departure from established precedents on abortion rights, and it has already had ripple effects across the country.

One of the most immediate impacts has been on the availability of legal abortions. In the wake of Dobbs, several states have moved to enact or enforce more restrictive abortion laws, citing the court's decision as a green light to do so.

For example, Texas recently passed a law that bans all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, effectively outlawing the procedure for most people in the state. The law also allows private citizens to file lawsuits against anyone who aids or abets an abortion, including drivers who take patients to clinics or people who provide financial assistance.

Other states have introduced bills that would similarly restrict abortion access, with some even enacting so-called ""trigger laws"" that would automatically ban the procedure if Roe v. Wade is overturned.

All of these developments have had a chilling effect on the availability of legal abortions. Patients and providers alike are navigating an increasingly hostile legal landscape, with some clinics opting to shut down rather than risk legal action.

The Guttmacher Institute's Analysis

The Guttmacher Institute's new analysis provides some quantitative data to supplement these anecdotal accounts of declining abortion access.

To arrive at their estimate of 32,000 fewer legal abortions, Guttmacher researchers used a few different sources of data.

First, they looked at the number of legal abortions performed in the US during the six-month period in question, which they obtained from state health departments and national abortion reporting systems. They then compared this figure to previous years' data to get a sense of whether the number of abortions was trending up or down over time.

Next, the researchers used a statistical model to estimate what the abortion rate would have been in the absence of the Dobbs decision. To do this, they factored in trends in abortion rates, the number of pregnancies, and the number of individuals seeking abortion care.

Finally, the researchers compared the actual abortion rate to this estimated rate to arrive at their conclusion that there were approximately 32,000 fewer legal abortions in the US between December 2021 and May 2022 than there would have been otherwise.

It's worth noting that this is an estimate and is subject to some limitations. For example, the analysis only covers a six-month period, so it's possible that the impact of the Dobbs decision could become more or less pronounced over time. Additionally, some states may not have yet reported their abortion data for the relevant time period, which could skew the final numbers.

Still, as the Guttmacher researchers point out, the magnitude of the decline they estimate suggests that something significant is happening in the wake of Dobbs.

""Although this number is an estimate, the size of the change suggests that it cannot be dismissed as a chance fluctuation,"" the researchers write. ""It is also notable that the difference appears to be distributed across the country, rather than reflecting large declines in individual states or regions.""

What this Means for the Future of Reproductive Rights

So what does this new data tell us about the future of reproductive rights in the US? As is often the case with legal battles over contentious issues, the answer is complicated.

On the one hand, the significant decline in legal abortions is clearly a worrying trend for advocates of reproductive rights. It suggests that the Dobbs decision and its aftermath are having a real-world impact on the ability of people to access the care they need.

Furthermore, as we noted earlier, the Dobbs ruling has emboldened anti-abortion activists and legislators to push for even more restrictive laws. If these laws continue to proliferate, it's likely that the decline in legal abortions will only accelerate.

At the same time, however, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. For one, legal challenges to these laws are already underway, with several cases currently making their way through the courts. And as we've seen in the past, the Supreme Court's rulings on abortion rights can be brutally divisive but ultimately can swing back in the other direction.

Additionally, the political landscape around abortion is somewhat fluid. While there may be a more conservative majority on the Supreme Court at the moment, public opinion on abortion has historically been fairly stable, with the majority of Americans supporting the right to choose in some form.

If activists can harness that public support and mobilize around the issue, it's possible that they could push back against restrictive laws and ultimately secure more expansive protections for reproductive rights.

Ultimately, the decline in legal abortions is concerning, but it's also a reminder that reproductive rights are always at risk and must be fought for constantly. Whether through legal challenges, grassroots organizing, or legislative action, those who support the right to choose must remain vigilant in the face of any challenges that come their way.",1
46,"Project that gave $500 a month to some California residents shows that such efforts could have a 'profound impact on public health, researchers say","In recent years, guaranteed income programs have been at the forefront of public policy debates. The concept of giving individuals a basic income with no strings attached has been gaining traction in many parts of the world, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

One such program was recently carried out in the city of Stockton, California, where a group of residents received $500 a month for two years as part of a pilot program. The program ended in January 2020, and the results were analyzed by researchers to determine its impact on the residents' lives.

The results were promising. The program not only improved the financial well-being of the participants but also had a positive impact on their mental and physical health. Researchers believe that guaranteed income programs like these could have a profound impact on public health in the long run.

The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) was launched in 2019 and was funded entirely through private donations. It provided 125 residents in the city with $500 a month for two years, with no strings attached. The program was designed to provide financial assistance to those in need and to bring attention to the benefits of providing a basic income.

The pilot program was led by Stockton's former mayor, Michael Tubbs, who became the youngest mayor in the city's history at the age of 26. Tubbs has been a vocal advocate for a guaranteed income and has pushed for its implementation at the state and federal levels.

Speaking to CNN, Tubbs said, ""The goal was to provide dignified income support to those living on the economic margins and to provide local data to inform policies that could be replicated in other cities and states.""

The program's results were analyzed by the University of Tennessee and the University of Pennsylvania, who found that the participants' lives had significantly improved after receiving the monthly sum. The study found that the recipients of the guaranteed income program were more likely to have full-time employment, spent more time with their families, and had fewer incidents of financial instability.

Furthermore, the program had a positive impact on the participants' mental and physical health. The recipients reported lower levels of anxiety and depression and showed a significant improvement in their overall well-being. The researchers believe that the program's positive impact on health could have a long-term impact on public health.

Dr. Stacey McMorrow, a health policy expert and associate professor at Georgia State University, told CNN that guaranteed income programs like the SEED could have a profound impact on public health by reducing stress and improving overall well-being, leading to fewer health problems.

""When people have access to financial support, they are better able to meet their basic needs,"" McMorrow said. ""This can lead to decreased stress and anxiety, which can have a positive impact on various health outcomes.""

McMorrow also stated that a guaranteed income could help address the social determinants of health, which are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, and age, and which can have a significant impact on their health outcomes. Addressing these social determinants can help reduce health inequities and improve overall health outcomes.

Guaranteed income programs have been gaining traction in recent years, with several cities in the US implementing pilot programs to test their efficacy. In addition to Stockton, cities like Oakland, California, and Saint Paul, Minnesota, have also launched guaranteed income programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for a basic income, with millions of Americans losing their jobs and struggling to make ends meet. The pandemic has also exposed the social and economic inequities that exist in the US, with low-income communities and communities of color bearing the brunt of the crisis.

Many experts believe that a guaranteed income could help address these inequities and provide a safety net for those in need, regardless of their employment status. The concept of a basic income has gained widespread support from policymakers, academics, and activists around the world.

However, there are still concerns about the cost of implementing such a program and the impact it could have on the economy. Critics argue that a basic income could disincentivize work and lead to inflation.

In response, advocates of a guaranteed income argue that the potential benefits of such a program outweigh the costs. They argue that providing financial security to low-income individuals and families could have a ripple effect on the economy, leading to increased consumer spending and economic growth.

Moreover, the SEED program found that the majority of the participants continued to work while receiving the monthly income. The program did not lead to a significant impact on the employment rate or the participants' work behavior.

In conclusion, the SEED program in Stockton, California, has shown that guaranteed income programs could have a significant impact on public health and financial well-being. The findings of the study provide evidence that a basic income can improve the overall quality of life for low-income individuals and families.

As the US grapples with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, guaranteed income programs could provide a safety net for those in need and address the social and economic inequities that exist in the country. Policymakers and advocates must carefully consider the potential benefits and costs of a basic income and work together to create policies that can ensure that every American has access to financial security and a dignified life.",1
47,Behold the stuffed-crust bagel,"In the world of breakfast foods, there may be no greater invention than the bagel. This round bread of Jewish origin has become a staple in many diets, enjoyed with everything from cream cheese to lox to bacon and eggs. But what if you could take the classic bagel even further, creating a new type of breakfast treat that is sure to delight and surprise your taste buds? Well, that's exactly what the stuffed-crust bagel aims to do.

Yes, you read that right: The stuffed-crust bagel is a bagel that has been stuffed with cheese or another delicious filling, creating a warm, gooey surprise at the center of the bread. Similar to a stuffed crust pizza, this bagel is a game-changer for breakfast enthusiasts everywhere.

While the concept of stuffing a bagel may seem like a novelty, it's actually been around for decades. In some parts of the world, stuffed bagels are a common sight at bakeries and breakfast spots. But it's only recently that the trend has caught on in a big way in the United States, with specialty bagel shops and fast-food chains alike offering their own takes on the stuffed-crust bagel.

One of the earliest adopters of the stuffed-crust bagel was the pizza chain Pizza Hut. In 2016, the company introduced its ""Triple Cheese Covered Stuffed Crust"" pizza, which featured a crust stuffed with mozzarella, provolone, and white cheddar. But it was the restaurant's decision to apply this concept to a bagel that really raised eyebrows.

In 2019, Pizza Hut introduced the ""Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza"", which featured a crust stuffed with garlic butter and cheese. But perhaps even more exciting was the ""Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza"", which saw the chain taking the bagel to a new level. This breakfast offering featured a bagel stuffed with bacon, egg, and cheese, along with a side of marinara dipping sauce.

So what makes the stuffed-crust bagel such a popular choice for breakfast lovers? For one thing, it's the ultimate combination of savory and sweet. The chewy, slightly sweet bagel dough pairs perfectly with the salty, creamy filling, creating a contrast of flavors that is hard to beat. And unlike some other breakfast foods, the stuffed-crust bagel is also highly customizable. Depending on the filling, you can create a hearty breakfast sandwich or a lighter option that is still satisfying.

For those looking to try a stuffed-crust bagel, there are now plenty of options to choose from. In addition to fast-food chains like Pizza Hut and Dunkin' Donuts, many local and independent bagel shops are now offering their own unique takes on the trend. Some popular fillings include cream cheese, bacon, sausage, ham, and various types of cheese.

However, it's important to note that not all stuffed-crust bagels are created equal. While some may be perfectly fluffy and oozing with cheesy goodness, others may be overly dense or lacking in filling. To truly enjoy a stuffed-crust bagel, it's important to seek out a reputable and high-quality bakery or restaurant that takes the time to make each bagel by hand.

One such bakery is The Bagelry in Santa Cruz, California. This family-owned and operated bakery has been a staple in the community for over 30 years, serving up fresh, handmade bagels and other baked goods. In recent years, the bakery has also started offering a wide variety of stuffed bagels, with fillings ranging from chorizo and jalapeno to lox and cream cheese.

At The Bagelry, the stuffed-crust bagel is taken very seriously. Each bagel is made with care and attention to detail, ensuring that the filling is evenly distributed throughout the bread. The result is a bagel that is both delicious and visually stunning, with a golden, crispy exterior and a soft, melty center.

But it's not just small, independent bakeries that are embracing the stuffed-crust bagel trend. Even major fast-food chains like Dunkin' Donuts are getting in on the action. In late 2020, the chain announced the launch of its ""Stuffed Bagel Minis"", which are essentially bite-sized stuffed-crust bagels. The minis come in two flavors – plain and everything – and are filled with cream cheese.

While some may criticize the fast-food version of the stuffed-crust bagel as a cheap imitation of the real thing, others see it as an opportunity to introduce the concept to a wider audience. Dunkin' Donuts, in particular, has massive reach and visibility, and its decision to offer stuffed-crust bagels may be just what the trend needs to really take off.

Of course, with any new food trend comes the inevitable criticism and backlash. Some have argued that the stuffed-crust bagel is simply too indulgent and unhealthy, with too many calories and too much fat. Others have taken issue with the very concept of stuffing a bagel, arguing that it goes against the traditional integrity of the bread.

But at the end of the day, food is about enjoyment and pleasure. And there's no denying that the stuffed-crust bagel is a fun and exciting way to enjoy one of the most beloved breakfast foods around. So go ahead and indulge in a stuffed-crust bagel every once in a while – your taste buds will thank you.",1
48,'Sticky doors' could be a warning sign for this dangerous natural disaster,"As hurricane season approaches, experts are warning of a lesser-known but potentially dangerous natural disaster that could leave homeowners vulnerable to severe wind damage. ""Sticky doors"" may be a warning sign of a phenomenon called ""uplift pressure,"" where strong winds cause air to be forced into the home, increasing the pressure and potentially lifting the roof.

According to the National Hurricane Center, uplift pressure can occur during hurricane-force winds and sometimes result in the complete destruction of a structure. Identified by a telltale sign of hard-to-open doors, uplift pressure needs immediate attention to minimize its potential devastation.

High-velocity winds create a kind of air vacuum over a property with a tight roof or windows, which can force cooler outside air into the home's interior. As this air circulates, it carries with it the building's warm air while lifting the roof away from the walls.

To prevent uplift pressure, homeowners should keep interior doors open, allow air to circulate evenly, and caulk the gaps around doors and windows. Shutter installation may also provide an additional layer of protection.

As always, it's essential to stay informed about potential natural disasters and heed any warnings from local authorities. Take steps to safeguard your home before a storm strikes to protect yourself and your property from uplift pressure's potentially catastrophic effects.",1

52,The Juice mission will soon launch to Jupiter's icy ocean worlds,"The Juice mission will soon launch to Jupiter's icy ocean worlds

In 2022, the European Space Agency's largest planetary mission to date will take off – a journey to explore the mysteries of Jupiter and its moons. Known as the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), the spacecraft will study Jupiter's largest icy moons, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, to understand the fundamental questions of our solar system's formation, the potential for habitability, and the search for life beyond Earth.

Jupiter's icy moons are of particular interest to scientists because they harbor subterranean oceans beneath their frozen surfaces, some of the most promising places in our solar system for the presence of microbial extraterrestrial life.

JUICE will carry an array of instruments, including high-resolution cameras, laser altimeters, spectrometers, magnetometers, and a subsurface radar to penetrate the thick ice that covers the moons' surfaces. The mission's main objectives are to study the moons' geology, atmosphere, magnetic fields, and potential habitability.

""We know that there are oceans underneath the icy crusts of these moons. We want to know what these oceans are made of, how deep they are, and how they interact with the rocky cores,"" said Gaele Winters, the head of Planetary Science at the European Space Agency.

""JUICE will study the moons' surface features, detect the composition of the subsurface ocean, and analyze the chemical makeup and interactions between the ocean and the rocky core to determine the potential for habitability,"" she added.

The JUICE mission is a complex feat of engineering, involving some of the most advanced technology ever developed for interplanetary exploration.

The spacecraft will be powered by a solar array, using three panels that can generate up to 8200 watts of power. Its propulsion system will use a combination of chemical and electric thrusters, allowing the spacecraft to travel nearly 600 million kilometers to Jupiter in just under eight years.

Once it arrives in orbit around Jupiter, JUICE will conduct several flybys of Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, getting as close as 200 kilometers to their surfaces. It will then enter orbit around Ganymede, the largest moon in our solar system and the only known moon to have its own magnetic field.

""Ganymede is of particular interest because it is the only moon in the solar system with its own magnetic field, and it is surrounded by a thin atmosphere of oxygen,"" said Winters. ""We want to understand how this magnetic field is generated, how it interacts with the environment, and what drives the atmospheric escape.""

JUICE will spend nearly three years in orbit around Ganymede, studying the moon in detail from multiple angles and measuring its atmosphere, magnetic field, and surface geology. It will also study the interactions between Ganymede and Jupiter's magnetosphere, the region around the planet where charged particles are trapped by its magnetic field.

One of the major challenges of the JUICE mission is ensuring that the spacecraft does not contaminate the potentially habitable environments it is studying. To achieve this, the spacecraft is being built using stringent planetary protection protocols and will undergo extensive testing and cleaning to remove any potential biological contaminants.

""We take planetary protection very seriously,"" said Winters. ""We want to avoid any interference or contamination from Earth's environment, and we also want to make sure we're not introducing anything that could potentially harm any existing life that might be present on these moons.""

The JUICE mission is a collaborative effort involving more than 80 scientific institutes and industrial partners from across Europe, with additional contributions from NASA and other international partners.

""The JUICE mission is a testament to the power of international cooperation,"" said Winters. ""It's a complex and challenging mission that requires expertise and resources from many different countries and institutions, and we're proud to be working together to achieve this ambitious goal.""

The JUICE mission is expected to launch in June 2022, with the spacecraft arriving at Jupiter in October 2030. It will be a landmark achievement in the study of our solar system's icy moons and could hold the key to discovering the origins of life beyond Earth.",1
53,This life-saving medical device isn't required at all schools. Damar Hamlin wants to help change that,"For most parents, sending their child off to school is a daily routine filled with mixed emotions of pride, worry, and anxiety. While many parents find comfort in knowing that their child will be safe within the walls of the school, little do they know that most schools are not equipped with life-saving medical devices that can make a world of difference in the event of an emergency.

Damar Hamlin, a passionate inventor and entrepreneur, has made it his mission to change the status quo and ensure that all schools across the country are equipped with a medical device that can save the lives of children in distress.

Meet Damar Hamlin

Damar Hamlin is not your average inventor. As a Black man growing up in a tough neighborhood in South Side Chicago, Damar had to fight tooth and nail to make it out alive. He was determined to rise above the circumstances that surrounded him, and his curiosity and passion for science and engineering bloomed from there.

After graduating from high school, Damar attended the University of Illinois, where he studied biomedical engineering. It was there that he discovered his love for inventing and founded his first company, STEAM Education, to teach children about science, technology, engineering, arts, and math.

Since then, he has focused on designing and developing sustainable and innovative health care technologies that are accessible to everyone. He founded CALEDOS Lab, where he works with a team of experienced scientists and engineers, to create medical devices that can reduce health care costs while improving patient outcomes.

The inspiration for Damar's latest invention, the LifeBot® Life Saving Station, came after a friend's child had a seizure at school. The school was not equipped with a device that could provide immediate medical response, and Damar knew that he had the skills and resources to help.

The LifeBot® Life Saving Station is a powerful device that can communicate with patients, caregivers, and first responders to provide immediate medical intervention in the event of an emergency.

How LifeBot® Works

LifeBot® is a platform that connects all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. With a unique combination of hardware and software, the device delivers synchronous audio and visual communication and facilitates seamless collaboration between first responders and remote life-saving experts.

In a nutshell, LifeBot® is a portable telemedicine and telehealth system that allows schools to communicate with emergency medical services (EMS) in real-time. The system consists of a lightweight and user-friendly mobile device, a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure monitor, an oximeter, and other medical sensors that can be customized based on the needs of each school.

When a student experiences a medical emergency, a teacher or staff member can activate the LifeBot® device to establish a connection with EMS. The system allows users to provide a live video feed of the patient, audio communication with EMS, and automatic transmission of critical medical information.

LifeBot® runs on the cloud, meaning all data is securely stored and accessible by authorized personnel on any device, in real-time. The device can also be integrated with existing electronic health records (EHR) systems to provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient's medical history.

Currently, LifeBot® is the only life-saving device that can provide a two-way audio and video platform during emergencies, and it has already been used to save countless lives.

Damar's Commitment to Saving Lives

Damar and his team understand the critical role that LifeBot® plays in saving lives. That is why they are committed to their mission of ensuring that the device is available to every school across the country.

Damar is passionate about advocating for the inclusion of LifeBot® in every school's emergency response plan. He believes that every school should have a LifeBot® Life Saving Station, just as they have fire extinguishers and first aid kits.

""Every school should have a LifeBot® Life Saving Station, and it should be mandatory. It's a fundamental right for children to be safe and have access to life-saving technology,"" says Damar.

Damar and his team have taken their advocacy beyond their design table and are actively working to ensure that LifeBot® is accessible to schools that need it the most. They have partnered with schools and organizations across the country and have launched an online campaign to raise awareness about the importance of life-saving medical devices in schools.

Their campaign aims to educate the public on the dangers of not having access to life-saving medical technology, especially in schools. According to a study conducted by the American Heart Association, sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death among student-athletes, and only 50 percent of high schools in the United States have automated external defibrillators (AEDs) accessible.

This highlights the critical importance of having life-saving medical devices like LifeBot® in schools. With its portable design and ability to transmit critical medical information in real-time, the LifeBot® Life Saving Station is a game-changer in medical emergency response.

The Importance of LifeBot® in Schools

Over the years, schools have implemented various technologies to help keep students safe. However, few have considered the importance of life-saving medical devices like LifeBot®. Here's why every school needs a LifeBot® Life Saving Station.

Damar Hamlin and his team at CALEDOS Lab are doing their part, and it's up to all of us to join them on this quest to create meaningful change.",1
54,Head of top UK business lobby fired over misconduct claims,"The head of one of the UK's premier business lobbies has been removed from his position amid allegations of misconduct.

In a statement announcing the decision, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that ""serious concerns"" had been raised about the actions of the organization's director general, prompting an investigation and ultimately his firing.

""These are very serious allegations and we have a responsibility to investigate them thoroughly to ensure that we continue to uphold the high standards our members expect,"" the statement said.

The CBI is one of the UK's most influential business organizations, with over 190,000 members across a range of industries. It acts as a lobbying group, representing its members in talks with the government on issues of economic policy, trade, and employment.

The now-former head of the CBI has not yet been named publicly, and specifics about the nature of the allegations against him have not been made clear. However, rumors have surfaced suggesting that they may relate to inappropriate behavior towards female staff members.

News of the accusations has come as a shock to many in the business world, who had regarded the outgoing director general as a skilled and respected figurehead for the CBI.

The decision to dismiss him is likely to have significant repercussions across the organization, and may also have an impact on the broader business community in the UK.

One potential concern is that the incident could undermine the credibility of the CBI as a whole, casting doubt on its ability to represent its members effectively in talks with the government and other stakeholders.

The situation may also prompt renewed scrutiny of the wider issue of sexual harassment and misconduct in the workplace, which has been a hot topic in recent years in both the UK and beyond.

A number of high-profile cases have drawn attention to the issue in the business world, with companies such as Uber and Fox News facing criticism for their handling of sexual harassment allegations against senior staff.

In response, many businesses have sought to introduce new policies and training programs aimed at preventing harassment and ensuring that employees feel safe and supported in the workplace.

However, there remains concern that incidents of this nature are still occurring more frequently than is often reported, and that many victims may still feel unable to come forward and speak out.

In this context, the CBI has an important role to play in setting an example for other businesses and demonstrating a commitment to ensuring that all staff are treated with respect and dignity.

The organization has already indicated that it intends to take this matter seriously, stating that it will be launching an independent review to examine its internal procedures and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future.

""We have a responsibility to our members, our staff, and the wider community to ensure that we have the highest possible standards in place,"" the CBI's statement said.

""We are committed to fostering a culture of respect and dignity across the organization and will work tirelessly to achieve this in the months and years ahead.""

The incident has also prompted reflection on broader issues facing the UK business community at this time.

Many companies are currently grappling with ongoing uncertainty over Brexit, with negotiations between the UK and EU still ongoing and little clarity yet on what the final outcome will be.

This climate of uncertainty is widely seen as posing significant challenges for businesses, with many struggling to plan for the future or make the most of potential opportunities.

The CBI has been vocal in its calls for a clear and orderly Brexit process, and has been closely involved in negotiations with the government on issues such as trade and regulatory alignment.

However, the dismissal of its director general may now cause some to question the organization's effectiveness in representing its members effectively at such a critical time.

Amid these broader concerns, there is likely to be a significant amount of scrutiny on the CBI in the coming days and weeks as the fallout from the situation continues to unfold.

Many will be watching to see how the organization responds to the allegations, and will be keen to see evidence that it is taking all necessary steps to ensure that its internal processes are robust and effective.

There will also be pressure on the government to respond, with some calling for a thorough investigation into the allegations and for any individuals found to have been involved in misconduct to be held to account.

Overall, this is a highly troubling incident for the UK business community, and one that highlights the importance of a continued focus on issues of ethics, respect, and dignity in the workplace.

As the CBI and the wider business world seek to navigate a complex and challenging environment, it is essential that they demonstrate their commitment to these values and take decisive action when necessary to address incidents such as this one.",1
55,The convicted murderer suspected of faking his own death in a South African prison fire,"The convicted murderer suspected of faking his own death in a South African prison fire

In July 2021, a fire broke out at the Pietermaritzburg Correctional Centre in South Africa, leading to the deaths of three inmates. While the incident was initially thought to be a tragic accident, suspicions have arisen that one of the prisoners who died in the fire, a convicted murderer named Sibusiso Mthethwa, may have faked his own death in order to escape from prison.

Mthethwa, who was serving a life sentence for the killing of a police officer, had been involved in previous escape attempts and was considered a high-risk inmate. According to witnesses, he had been acting strangely in the days leading up to the fire, leading some to speculate that he may have been planning something.

After the fire was extinguished, Mthethwa's body was identified among the dead. However, some have questioned whether the body was really his or if he somehow managed to switch places with another inmate who died in the fire. The prison has launched an investigation into the incident, but so far, no definitive answers have been found.

The possibility that Mthethwa may have successfully faked his own death has many people concerned. If he is indeed on the run, he could be a danger to society, particularly given his violent past. Furthermore, his escape would raise serious questions about the security of South Africa's prison system and the ability of authorities to prevent inmates from breaking out.

But how likely is it that Mthethwa could have pulled off such a audacious scheme? And what might have motivated him to do so? To answer these questions, we need to take a closer look at Mthethwa's background and the circumstances surrounding the fire.

Who is Sibusiso Mthethwa?

Sibusiso Mthethwa was a 31-year-old man from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. He was convicted of murder in 2015 after he shot and killed a police officer during a robbery. Mthethwa was sentenced to life in prison for the crime, and was transferred to the Pietermaritzburg Correctional Centre to serve his sentence.

According to reports, Mthethwa was considered a ""difficult"" inmate due to his history of violence and his involvement in previous escape attempts. In 2017, he and several other inmates attempted to escape from the same prison by digging a tunnel underneath the perimeter fence. The plan was foiled by prison guards, but the incident raised concerns about the security of the facility.

In the years that followed, Mthethwa is said to have become increasingly despondent and agitated. According to one former inmate who spoke to journalists after the fire, Mthethwa had been struggling to adjust to life behind bars and was prone to outbursts of anger.

""He used to scream and shout and get very violent,"" the former inmate said. ""It was like he was losing his mind.""

As the date of the fire approached, some witnesses say that Mthethwa became even more erratic. One guard reported that Mthethwa had approached him and asked if he could be moved to a different cell, claiming that he was having trouble sleeping. Another inmate claimed that he had overheard Mthethwa talking about a ""big plan"" that he had in the works.

These comments have led some to wonder if Mthethwa was planning some kind of escape or if he had something else in mind.

The fire at Pietermaritzburg Correctional Centre

On July 22, 2021, a fire broke out at the Pietermaritzburg Correctional Centre. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, but it is believed to have started in one of the cells in the D-section of the prison.

The fire quickly spread through the cell block, causing panic among the inmates. Guards were able to evacuate many of the prisoners, but three inmates were killed in the blaze, including Mthethwa.

Initially, it was believed that the fire was a tragic accident. However, rumors began to circulate that Mthethwa may have been planning something and that his death may not have been what it seemed.

The suspicions were fueled by a number of factors. For one, some witnesses claimed that Mthethwa had been acting strangely in the days leading up to the fire. For another, it was reported that Mthethwa's body had been badly burned, making it difficult to positively identify him.

It should be noted that Mthethwa was not the only inmate to die in the fire. Two other prisoners, identified as Sihle Mncube and Sifiso Zulu, were also killed. However, there has been far less speculation about their deaths, perhaps because they were not considered to be high-risk inmates like Mthethwa.

Did Mthethwa fake his own death?

The question on everyone's minds is whether or not Mthethwa managed to fake his own death in the fire. While there is no concrete evidence to support this theory, there are certainly some reasons to be skeptical of the official story.

For one thing, Mthethwa was a known escape risk who had attempted to break out of prison in the past. It is not hard to imagine that he might have been planning another escape attempt, and that the fire provided him with an opportunity to make a run for it.

Furthermore, Mthethwa's badly burned body has made it difficult to positively identify him. While authorities claim to have matched his DNA to that of his family members, some have wondered whether the body might actually belong to someone else.

Finally, there are the reports that Mthethwa had been acting strangely in the days and weeks leading up to the fire. Some have speculated that he may have been planning something, whether it was an escape attempt or something else altogether.

None of these factors, of course, are definitive proof that Mthethwa faked his own death. It is entirely possible that he did die in the fire and that the suspicions are unfounded. However, the possibility that he could have pulled off such a stunt is concerning, to say the least.

What happens now?

The Pietermaritzburg Correctional Centre has launched an investigation into the fire and the circumstances surrounding it. The investigation is ongoing, and so far, no definitive answers have been found.

In the meantime, authorities are on the lookout for Mthethwa, in case he did indeed manage to escape. The fact that he is a convicted murderer who was serving a life sentence makes his disappearance all the more troubling.

The incident has also raised serious questions about the security of South Africa's prison system. If Mthethwa was able to fake his own death and make a break for it, what other holes might there be in the system? And how can these gaps be plugged to prevent other dangerous inmates from escaping?

These are questions that will require serious consideration and action from prison officials and government authorities. For now, however, the focus is on finding out what really happened to Sibusiso Mthethwa and whether or not he is still on the run.",1

57,"One year after their Virginia defamation trial, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have found peace abroad","It was a trial that shook the world of Hollywood and left everyone with a bad taste in their mouth. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard made headlines in 2019, after they both accused each other of domestic abuse. The trial took place in Virginia, and the media was quick to jump on every detail of the gruesome story. After months of legal battles and public scrutiny, the two have now found peace abroad, one year after their trial.

Johnny and Amber were both major players in the entertainment industry when they got together, with Johnny known for his iconic roles in movies such as “Pirates of the Caribbean” and Amber known for her appearances in movies like “Aquaman” and TV series “The Stand”. However, when the two got together, things didn't go as smoothly as they had hoped. Within a year of their marriage, Amber had filed for divorce, citing abuse on Johnny's part.

What followed was a nightmare for both parties involved. The media was quick to pick up on every detail of the case, and for months, it was a huge topic of discussion. Amber accused Johnny of physical and emotional abuse during their marriage, even alleging at one point that he had hit her with a phone, resulting in a black eye. Johnny vehemently denied these claims, and he filed a defamation lawsuit against Amber, claiming that her allegations were false and had harmed his reputation.

The trial that followed was a long and drawn-out process, with both sides presenting evidence and accusations against each other. In the end, the judge found in favor of Johnny, ruling that Amber had indeed defamed him with her accusations. The damages awarded to Johnny were put at $7 million, which he pledged to donate to charity.

The trial left a bad taste in everyone's mouth, with fans and the media divided. Many believed that Johnny had been unfairly targeted and that Amber was using her position of power to smear his name. Others felt that Amber was the victim and that Johnny had been trying to cover up his actions.

One year later, both Johnny and Amber have managed to move on with their lives. Johnny has taken up residence in France, while Amber has been working on her latest projects. In an interview with CNN, Johnny opened up about his life after the trial, saying that he was happy to have put it all behind him.
 
""It was a difficult time for me, but I'm very grateful for everything that's happened since then. I've been able to focus on my work and my family, and I feel like I've come out of it all stronger,"" he said.

Johnny has been open about his struggles with alcoholism and has said that he's been sober for over a year now. He's also been working on several new projects, including the upcoming “Fantastic Beasts” film, where he reprises his role as Gellert Grindelwald.

Amber, on the other hand, has been spending her time working on her activism and charity work. She's been vocal about her own experiences with domestic abuse, and she's been using her platform to raise awareness about this issue. She recently joined forces with the American Civil Liberties Union to help victims of domestic abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the difficult time that they went through, both Johnny and Amber have managed to find peace and happiness in their lives. It's clear that the legal battle took a toll on both of them, but they've both managed to come out on the other side stronger and more resilient.

It's also worth noting that the case brought to light the issue of domestic abuse and how it's often swept under the rug in the entertainment industry. It's important that more attention is given to this issue, and that victims have a safe space to speak out and seek help.

The trial may be over, but the discussion about domestic abuse and how to prevent it from happening in the future is ongoing. It's our responsibility as a society to listen to victims, raise awareness about this issue, and start taking action to end domestic violence once and for all.

It's clear that Johnny and Amber have moved on with their lives, and it's time for us to do the same. Let's focus on making sure that cases like this are never allowed to happen again, and that everyone has the opportunity to live their lives free from violence and abuse.",1
58,Should Fox settle defamation lawsuit? Prominent lawyer weighs in,"Fox News is facing a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, the electronic voting company, over false claims made about the company’s role in the 2020 presidential election. Many are wondering if Fox should settle the lawsuit, including prominent lawyer David Boies.

Boies has weighed in on the matter and believes that Fox should settle the lawsuit. In an interview with CNN, Boies stated, “I think it’s important for Fox to send a message that they’re not going to continue to disseminate false information, particularly when it comes to something as important as the integrity of our elections.”

Boies also acknowledged that settlements can be costly, but he believes that settling the lawsuit would be a small price to pay in comparison to continuously spreading false information. “Settlements can be expensive, but when you’re talking about something as important as the integrity of our democracy, I think Fox needs to do the right thing and settle this lawsuit,” said Boies.

Smartmatic’s lawsuit claims that Fox News “churned out a series of demonstrably false aspersions” about the company, which resulted in a loss of business for the company. Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion in damages from Fox News.

It remains to be seen if Fox News will take Boies’ advice and settle the lawsuit, but one thing is clear, the spreading of false information has real-world consequences and it’s time for accountability.",1
59,US declares journalist Evan Gershkovich wrongfully detained by Russia,"In a statement on Friday, the US State Department declared that journalist Evan Gershkovich has been wrongfully detained by Russian authorities.

Gershkovich, who previously worked for the Moscow Times, was detained by Russian officials in a raid on his apartment in Moscow on July 13th. He was accused of being involved with an organization labeled as ""undesirable"" by the Russian government, and has been held in detention ever since.

The US State Department condemned the actions of the Russian government, stating that Gershkovich's detention is a clear violation of his human rights and democratic principles.

""The United States strongly condemns the detention of Evan Gershkovich by the Russian authorities,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""We call on the Russian government to immediately release him and allow him to return to his family and his work as a journalist.""

This is not the first time that journalists have been targeted in Russia. In recent years, there has been a growing crackdown on independent media outlets and journalists critical of the Russian government.

The detention of Evan Gershkovitch is just another example of this troubling trend. The US Government's cautious diplomatic response to this appalling human rights violation suggests that the fate of free and independent journalism in Russia is more precarious than ever.",1
60,Martha Stewart welcomes Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders over Easter weekend,"Martha Stewart, the lifestyle icon, invited comedian Pete Davidson and his rumored girlfriend, fashion designer Chase Sui Wonders, for an Easter weekend celebration at her Bedford, New York estate.

The invitation extended to Davidson, who is a frequent guest on Saturday Night Live, was a surprising one given his reputation for high-profile relationships and his controversial public appearances. However, fans were excited to see him spending time with the domestic guru who is known for her impeccable taste and sense of hospitality.

The weekend celebration began on Good Friday, April 2, with the guests arriving at Stewart's grand stone mansion nestled on a sprawling 153-acre plot of land in the countryside. The star-studded group of attendees included, in addition to Davidson and Wonders, the TV host of The Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon and his wife, Nancy Juvonen, among others.

Martha Stewart, an avid enthusiast for Easter, had transformed her iconic estate into a springtime wonderland, complete with pastel colors, Easter bunny decorations and spring flowers. One of the highlights of the weekend was the traditional annual Easter egg hunt. Attendees scoured Stewart's estate in search of colorful eggs filled with sweets and other delicious treats.

The theme of the weekend celebration was ""family and friends,"" and Stewart, who has always described herself as ""the ultimate hostess,"" made it a point to ensure everyone was comfortable and having a great time. She shared updates on her Instagram page with pictures of the egg hunt and the guests enjoying the outdoors.

On Saturday, the celebration continued with more outdoor activities. Stewart showed her guests how to collect fresh eggs from her chicken coop and taught them how to make homemade pasta from scratch. She shared photos on Instagram of the guests getting their hands dirty with flour and pasta dough.

Davidson, who has described himself as struggling with mental health issues in the past, found the celebrations to be a much-needed break from the limelight. The comedian has been open with his fans about his struggles, and fans were happy to see him spending quality time with friends and enjoying a low-key weekend.

Chase Sui Wonders, the designer and granddaughter of fashion icon Anna Sui, appeared to be having a great time as well. The weekend provided her with an opportunity to connect with Davidson away from the constant media scrutiny surrounding their rumored relationship.

Stewart has been a longtime supporter of Davidson and once expressed her admiration for the comedian on social media, where she referred to him as one of her ""all-time favorite guests"" on her show. In 2020, she even made a guest appearance on Saturday Night Live to mentor Davidson in a skit.

The Easter weekend was clearly a memorable one for both Davidson and Wonders. The couple was seen laughing and having a good time with their friends, and Stewart's hospitality seemed to have helped ease any potential discomfort from the pair's high-profile status.

While Davidson and Wonders have not publicly confirmed their relationship, the Easter weekend spent at Stewart's estate has kept their fans guessing. Whether it is a blossoming romance or simply a weekend getaway among friends and family, one thing is clear: it was a weekend to remember.

Martha Stewart, the master of the domestic arts, succeeded in hosting yet another successful gathering. Her impeccable taste and hospitality have always been adored by her fans, and this Easter weekend was no different. The colorful decorations, homemade pasta, and the traditional egg hunt all came together to create a perfect weekend experience for her guests, including Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders.

While Martha's Easter celebrations may be over, her fans eagerly await her next gathering, perhaps with a possible update from the comedian and his rumored love interest.",1
61,"National Recording Registry adds Madonna, John Lennon and Mariah Carey classics, plus Super Mario Bros. theme","The National Recording Registry, a prestigious group that seeks to preserve and celebrate the cultural significance of sound recordings through the ages, has added a number of new classics to their repertoire, including contributions from musical icons Madonna, John Lennon, and Mariah Carey.

In addition to these beloved pop stars, the registry has also recognized the cultural importance of a more unexpected addition - the iconic theme from the video game Super Mario Bros.

Each year, the National Recording Registry adds 25 recordings to its collection. These recordings span a wide range of genres and time periods, from early jazz music to contemporary spoken word poetry.

""We are incredibly proud to be able to recognize these incredible contributions to our cultural heritage,"" said Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. ""These recordings showcase some of the best and most important work in music and media, and we feel honored to ensure they will be preserved for future generations.""

One of the newly-added recordings is Madonna's iconic 1984 hit ""Like a Virgin."" This song was a massive commercial success upon its release, and helped cement Madonna's place as one of the most influential pop stars of all time.

""Like a Virgin"" is notable not just for its catchy melody and upbeat tempo, but also for its lyrical content, which tackled themes of female sexuality and empowerment in a way that was groundbreaking for the time.

Speaking about the song's inclusion in the registry, Madonna expressed her gratitude for the recognition, saying ""I'm thrilled and humbled that 'Like a Virgin' has been selected for the National Recording Registry. This song was a big turning point in my career and I'm so glad to see it still resonating with people today.""

Another newly-added classic is John Lennon's 1971 album ""Imagine."" This album is widely considered to be one of the greatest musical works of all time, and features some of Lennon's most iconic songs, including the title track ""Imagine.""

The ""Imagine"" song has become an anthem for peace, and its message of unity and harmony continues to resonate with people around the world. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine named ""Imagine"" one of the top 500 songs of all time.

Mariah Carey's classic holiday ballad ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" has also been recognized by the National Recording Registry. This beloved song has become a cherished staple of the holiday season, and is played on radio stations and in stores around the world every December.

""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" was released in 1994, and while it wasn't an immediate commercial success, it has since become one of the best-selling holiday songs of all time. The song's inclusion in the registry is a testament to its enduring popularity and cultural significance.

And then there's the Super Mario Bros. theme, which may seem like an unexpected addition to a list of iconic music recordings, but is nonetheless an important part of our cultural lexicon.

The theme, composed by Koji Kondo, is instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever played the classic Nintendo game. Its catchy melody and bouncy rhythm perfectly capture the whimsy and energy of the game's world, and have become deeply ingrained in popular culture.

In an interview with Kotaku, Kondo spoke about the making of the Super Mario Bros. theme, saying ""The original Mario Bros. was a game where you were in a sewer and had to fight off these critters coming out of the pipes. For the music, I wanted to create something that would evoke a playful mood, and that's where the bouncing rhythm came from.""

The National Recording Registry's recognition of the Super Mario Bros. theme is a nod to the important role that video games have played in our cultural landscape, and to the enduring popularity of this particular game and its theme music.

Overall, the newly-added recordings represent a diverse array of genres and time periods, united by their cultural significance and enduring popularity. As the National Recording Registry continues to grow and evolve, it provides an important window into our shared cultural heritage, and a reminder of the power of music and sound to shape our lives and our world.",1
62,The owner of Tiffany and Dior gets a boost from China's reopening,"As China reopens from its COVID-19 lockdown, luxury goods companies are seeing a surge in sales, with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton – the owner of top brands such as Tiffany and Dior – among the major beneficiaries of the recovery. 

In the first quarter of this year, LVMH’s sales fell by 17%, as the pandemic led to the closure of stores and a sharp drop in tourist traffic. However, the situation in China is now providing a bright spot for the company. 

According to LVMH, sales of its fashion and leather goods division in China saw a double-digit growth rate in April, following a more modest 8% growth rate in March. This suggests that the Chinese market is rapidly recovering from the impact of COVID-19, as consumers return to shopping and spending after months of being stuck at home. 

The boost to LVMH’s sales in China is a welcome development, given that the company has faced challenges in this market in recent years. The US-China trade war and anti-government protests in Hong Kong have led to a slowdown in luxury spending in the region. Additionally, last year the company was embroiled in a controversy over a Dior ad which was accused of insulting Chinese culture. 

The fact that LVMH is now seeing strong sales in China is a sign that the company has managed to overcome these challenges and is now reaping the benefits of its investments in the market. The company has been expanding its presence in China in recent years, opening new stores and launching digital initiatives to tap into the country’s growing middle class. 

One example of LVMH’s success in China is its partnership with JD.com, the country’s second-largest e-commerce platform. The two companies announced a strategic partnership in 2017, which has since led to the launch of JD Luxury Express – an online platform that enables Chinese consumers to purchase luxury goods through JD.com’s delivery network. 

LVMH has also been investing in brick-and-mortar stores in China, including a new Dior flagship store in Shanghai that opened in 2019. The store, located on the city’s famous Nanjing Road shopping avenue, features seven floors of Dior merchandise, including clothes, bags, and jewelry. 

The success of LVMH’s investments in China is not just due to the company’s own efforts, however. It is also a reflection of broader trends in the Chinese market, which is seeing a shift in consumer behavior towards more domestic spending. 

As China’s economy has grown over the past few decades, many consumers have sought to display their wealth and status by purchasing luxury goods from Western brands. However, this trend has started to change in recent years, as consumers become more nationalistic and seek out homegrown brands that reflect their identity and culture. 

This trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a surge in patriotic sentiment in China. As the country battles the virus, many consumers are looking to support local companies and buy products made in China. This has led to a boost in sales for Chinese luxury brands, such as Shang Xia, which is owned by Hermès. 

However, this shift towards domestic spending does not mean that Western brands are losing out in China. On the contrary, many foreign companies are now incorporating Chinese elements into their products in order to appeal to Chinese consumers. 

For example, in 2018, Dior launched a new collection inspired by the Chinese zodiac. The collection featured clothing, accessories, and jewelry that incorporated elements such as dragons, pearls, and calligraphy. The move was seen as an attempt by Dior to appeal to Chinese consumers and tap into the country’s rich cultural heritage. 

By incorporating Chinese elements into their products, foreign brands can appeal to Chinese consumers’ desire for products that reflect their identity and culture, while still maintaining their status as luxury goods. This strategy has proved successful for LVMH, as evidenced by the company’s sales growth in China. 

In addition to catering to local tastes, LVMH has also been investing in technology to enhance the customer experience in China. The company has launched a WeChat mini-program that allows consumers to browse and purchase products from its portfolio of luxury brands. 

The mini-program, called “LVMH Unique,” also provides consumers with personalized recommendations and exclusive content. This enables LVMH to engage with consumers in a way that is tailored to their preferences and interests, making the shopping experience more enjoyable and memorable. 

Furthermore, LVMH has also been investing in sustainable practices to appeal to environmentally-conscious consumers in China. The company recently launched an initiative called “Life 360,” which aims to reduce the environmental impact of its operations by implementing sustainable practices across its supply chain. 

This initiative includes measures such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting sustainable agriculture. By prioritizing sustainability, LVMH is able to appeal to consumers who are increasingly concerned about the environment and the impact of their consumption on the planet. 

Overall, LVMH’s success in China is a reflection of the company’s ability to adapt to changing market trends and consumer behavior. By investing in local partnerships, technology, and sustainability, the company has been able to tap into the growing middle class in China and build a loyal customer base. 

Nevertheless, LVMH still faces challenges in the Chinese market, particularly as tensions between the US and China continue to escalate. The trade war between the two countries has already impacted the luxury goods industry, with Chinese consumers shying away from American brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. 

Furthermore, the recent protests in Hong Kong have led to a decline in luxury spending in the city, which is a major hub for luxury goods in the region. LVMH owns several luxury brands with a significant presence in Hong Kong, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Fendi, which could be negatively affected by the political unrest. 

Nonetheless, the fact that LVMH is seeing strong sales growth in China is a sign that the company is well-positioned to weather these challenges and continue to thrive in the region. As China emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and consumers return to shopping and spending, LVMH is likely to benefit from the rebound in luxury sales. 

In conclusion, LVMH’s success in China is a testament to the company’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer behavior. By investing in local partnerships, technology, and sustainability, the company has been able to build a loyal customer base in China and capitalize on the growing middle class. While challenges remain, the company’s recent sales growth suggests that it is well-positioned to continue to thrive in this important market.",1
63,What is autism? An expert explains,"What is autism? An expert explains 

Autism is a neurological disorder that affects communication, social behavior, and sensory processing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 54 children in the United States. With such a prevalence, it's vital that people have a clear understanding of this condition. I spoke with Dr. Jennifer Johnson, a board-certified behavior analyst and an expert in autism, to help shed some light on the disorder. 

What is autism? 

Autism is a lifelong developmental disorder with symptoms that typically emerge in early childhood. It is a spectrum disorder, meaning that the severity and type of symptoms can vary widely among people with autism. However, some common features of autism include:

1. Difficulty with social communication and interaction. 

This can include difficulties with verbal and nonverbal cues, such as making eye contact, interpreting facial expressions, and understanding sarcasm or other forms of humor. 

2. Restricted and repetitive behaviors or interests. 

People with autism may develop unusual or highly specific areas of interest, engage in repetitive movements or behaviors, or prefer rigid routines. 

3. Sensory processing issues. 

Many children with autism experience sensory processing difficulties, such as being overly sensitive to sounds or textures. 

Diagnosing autism 

Diagnosing autism is typically done through a comprehensive evaluation that looks at a child's medical history, behavior, and developmental milestones. According to Dr. Johnson, this evaluation often involves several professionals, including a developmental pediatrician or neurologist, a psychologist or psychiatrist, and a speech therapist.

The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), is the official guide used by mental health professionals to diagnose autism. The DSM-5 outlines two main categories of symptoms that a child must exhibit to receive a diagnosis of autism:

1. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts

2. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities that must be present in early childhood, even if not recognized until later. 

According to Dr. Johnson, it's essential that children receive an accurate diagnosis as early as possible, ideally before the age of three. Early intervention programs can make a significant difference in a child's development and help children with autism reach their full potential. 

What causes autism? 

The exact causes of autism are not yet fully understood. Multiple factors have been suggested, including genetics, environmental factors, and abnormalities in brain development. According to Dr. Johnson, approximately 80% of autism cases are thought to have a genetic basis, although the actual genes involved may vary from person to person. 

""There's no one 'autism gene,'"" says Dr. Johnson. ""Genetics is complex, and autism likely results from the interaction of multiple genes that influence brain development and function."" 

Environmental factors may also play a role. Researchers have suggested that prenatal exposure to certain chemicals or toxins, such as lead or pesticides, may increase the risk of autism. However, Dr. Johnson emphasizes that the evidence linking specific environmental factors to autism is not yet strong. 

What are the treatments for autism? 

There is no cure for autism, but early treatment can help manage symptoms and improve outcomes. According to Dr. Johnson, the best treatment approach is one that is individualized to each child's needs and strengths. 

The CDC recommends that children with autism receive ""early intervention services aimed at improving their cognitive and functional development."" This may include therapies such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavior therapy. 

Behavior therapy, which includes applied behavior analysis (ABA), is an evidence-based treatment approach that has been widely studied and shown to be effective for reducing autism symptoms in children. ABA focuses on teaching new skills and behaviors and shaping existing behaviors to help children better interact with their environment and peers. 

Some children with autism may also benefit from medication. Medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms such as anxiety, hyperactivity, or aggression. However, Dr. Johnson notes that medication should always be used in conjunction with other therapeutic approaches, such as behavior therapy, and should always be closely monitored by a physician. 

What is life like for people with autism? 

Autism is a lifelong condition, and thus, life can be challenging for people with autism, particularly in terms of social interaction and communication. However, people with autism can and do lead fulfilling lives. 

Dr. Johnson notes that many people with autism have unique strengths and talents, such as exceptional memory, mathematical ability, or attention to detail. ""People with autism often have cognitive abilities that exceed their social and behavioral abilities,"" says Dr. Johnson. 

It's important to recognize that people with autism can have widely varying experiences and abilities. Some individuals with autism may require significant support throughout their lives, while others may be able to live independently. 

How can we support people with autism? 

Supporting people with autism starts with understanding and acceptance. According to Dr. Johnson, this includes recognizing that autism is a neurological difference, not a disease or a disorder. ""People with autism have different ways of processing information and interacting with the world,"" says Dr. Johnson. ""We need to accept and celebrate these differences and work to accommodate them."" 

One of the most critical ways to support people with autism is to provide them with access to appropriate services and treatment. This includes early intervention programs, therapy, and educational opportunities tailored to their individual strengths and needs. 

Dr. Johnson also emphasizes that creating an inclusive society that values and respects neurodiversity is essential. This includes ensuring that people with autism have access to the same opportunities as their neurotypical peers, such as employment, education, and social activities. 

Finally, Dr. Johnson encourages parents and family members of children with autism to seek out support and resources for themselves. ""Support groups and advocacy organizations can provide valuable information, connections, and emotional support,"" says Dr. Johnson. 

Conclusion 

Autism is a complex neurological disorder that affects communication, behavior, and sensory processing. It is a lifelong condition with symptoms that can vary widely among individuals. Early intervention programs and evidence-based therapies, such as applied behavior analysis, can make a significant difference in a child's development and help children with autism reach their full potential. 

People with autism have unique strengths and abilities, and it's important to recognize and value these differences. By providing appropriate services and support, we can help create an inclusive society that respects and accommodates neurodiversity.",1
64,"Inside Al-Aqsa, Muslims say they're losing control of the holy site","Inside Al-Aqsa, Muslims Say They're Losing Control of the Holy Site

Jerusalem, Palestine - Al-Aqsa, one of the holiest sites in Islam, is at the center of a growing controversy. Located in the old city of Jerusalem, the mosque has become the focal point of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians in recent years.

Muslims and Palestinians say they are losing control of the site, as Israeli forces increasingly restrict access to the mosque and surrounding areas. Clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian worshippers have become more frequent, with reports of excessive use of force by Israeli police.

The situation has prompted calls for international intervention and raised concerns about the future of the site, which has been a place of worship for Muslims for over a thousand years.

History of Al-Aqsa

Al-Aqsa is located on the Temple Mount, which is believed to be the site of the biblical Jewish temple. The mosque was built in the 7th century during the Islamic era and has since been expanded and renovated several times.

For over a thousand years, the site has been a place of worship for Muslims, and it holds great religious and cultural significance for Palestinians. The complex includes not only the mosque but also a number of other structures, including the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall.

The Al-Aqsa Mosque has become a symbol of the struggle between Palestinians and Israelis for control of Jerusalem. Palestinians see the mosque as a central part of their national identity and the focus of their struggle for self-determination. Israel, on the other hand, sees Jerusalem as its ""eternal, undivided capital"" and a cornerstone of its national identity.

It is no surprise then that tensions have been rising in recent years. According to the United Nations, between 2017 and 2018, there were over 1,000 incidents of violence in and around the Jerusalem Old City, with the Al-Aqsa mosque at the center of many of them.

The Role of Israeli Forces

One of the main issues for Muslims and Palestinians is the role of Israeli forces at the site. Israel has controlled the Temple Mount since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and requires all non-Muslims to enter the complex through a separate gate and be escorted by Israeli police.

Muslims and Palestinians argue that this gives Israel too much control over the mosque and has led to restrictions on Muslim access, including limiting the number of worshippers allowed to enter the mosque, restricting the age of worshippers, and prohibiting non-Muslims from praying on the site.

Israeli authorities, on the other hand, say that these measures are necessary for security reasons and to prevent violence. Israeli police have also been accused of using excessive force against Palestinian worshippers, including firing tear gas, rubber bullets, and stun grenades inside the mosque.

In July 2021, the situation escalated when Israeli forces closed the mosque to worshippers during Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest days in Islam, citing security concerns after clashes with Palestinian protesters.

The move was met with outrage from Muslims and Palestinians who said that it was an attempt to assert Israeli control over the mosque and prevent Muslims from worshiping. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, also issued a statement calling for ""resistance"" against Israel.

The Future of Al-Aqsa

The situation at Al-Aqsa has prompted international calls for action. In July 2021, the United Nations expressed concern over the closure of the mosque and the use of force by Israeli police.

The UN's Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, called on Israel to ""respect the historic status quo"" and allow access to the mosque for Muslims to worship.

The Jordanian government, which is responsible for the Islamic Waqf that oversees the mosque, has also called for international intervention. The Waqf has said that it is losing control of the site and that Israeli authorities are attempting to change the status quo.

The situation at Al-Aqsa has also highlighted the wider issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories. Palestinians argue that they are being denied their right to self-determination while Israeli authorities say that they are trying to ensure their security in a volatile region.

The future of Al-Aqsa is uncertain, but the tensions surrounding the site are unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. With both Israelis and Palestinians seeing it as central to their identity and security concerns on both sides, the situation is likely to continue to be a source of conflict.

Conclusion

Al-Aqsa is a symbol of the struggles and tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. The recent clashes and the closure of the mosque to worshippers have highlighted the deepening divisions between the two sides.

For Muslims and Palestinians, the mosque is a central part of their national identity and their struggle for self-determination. The increasing restrictions on Muslim access to the site and the use of force by Israeli police have raised concerns about their control over the mosque and the site's future.

The situation at Al-Aqsa has prompted calls for international intervention and underlined the need for a comprehensive resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Until that is achieved, however, the future of Al-Aqsa will remain uncertain, and the tensions surrounding the site will remain a source of conflict and division.",1
65,Ariana Grande says commenting on others' appearances is not OK: 'Be gentle with each other',"Ariana Grande has been known for speaking her mind on various social and political issues. But recently, the pop singer took to social media to express her thoughts on the issue of body shaming and societal beauty standards.

In a post on Instagram, Grande shared a photo of herself with the caption, ""I'm tired of living in a world where women are mostly referred to as a man's past, present or future PROPERTY / POSSESSION. I...do not. belong. to. anyone. but. myself. and. neither. do. you.""

In the same post, Grande also addressed the issue of body shaming, writing, ""I am tired of living in a world where women are not allowed to have flaws or make mistakes and still be respected.""

Grande's post came after she was criticized online for allegedly gaining weight. Fans were quick to jump to her defense, pointing out that she had been going through a difficult time after the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and the end of her engagement to comedian Pete Davidson.

In a subsequent post, Grande wrote, ""We're all human and we all have moments where we don't feel our best, and that's OK. But it's not OK to comment on someone's body or appearance in a negative way. Be gentle with each other.""

Grande's message of kindness and acceptance struck a chord with many of her fans, who applauded her for speaking out about body shaming and societal beauty standards.

Body shaming is a pervasive issue in our society, particularly for women. From advertising campaigns that perpetuate unrealistic beauty ideals to negative comments on social media, women are often subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism of their physical appearance.

Many celebrities have spoken out about the harmful effects of body shaming, including model Ashley Graham and actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Gemma Arterton. But despite these efforts, body shaming remains a prevalent problem.

One reason for this is the persistent belief that women's bodies are objects to be looked at and judged. This belief is reinforced by a number of social and cultural factors, including the media, which often focuses on women's appearance rather than their talents or accomplishments.

The beauty industry is also a major player in perpetuating unrealistic beauty standards. From diet pills to cosmetic surgery, many products and services are marketed to women as a way to achieve the perfect body. This reinforces the idea that women's worth is determined by their physical appearance.

Grande's message of self-acceptance and kindness is an important reminder that we should focus on people's talents and accomplishments, rather than their appearance. We should celebrate diversity and embrace the fact that everyone is unique.

As Grande wrote in her post, ""We're all human and we all have moments where we don't feel our best, and that's OK."" By treating others with kindness and respect, we can create a more positive and accepting society for everyone.",1

67,What markets are watching after digesting the US jobs data,"What Markets are Watching After Digesting the US Jobs Data

The US jobs report released on Friday, September 3 was perhaps the most important economic data release of the year so far. It showed that the US economy added 235,000 jobs in August, which was roughly in line with expectations. The unemployment rate also fell to 5.2%, down from 5.4% in July. This marked a solid improvement from the previous month's report, which saw weaker-than-expected jobs growth.

While investors cheered the latest report, there were some concerns about what it could mean for the overall health of the economy. Furthermore, it is unclear what impact this could have on the Federal Reserve’s plans to tighten monetary policy.

The stock market reaction to the jobs report was mixed, as investors digested the implications of the latest data. The S&P 500 was up 0.2% at the close of trading on Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.2% lower than the previous session. The mixed reaction suggests that investors are still in a wait-and-see mode, as they try to gauge the economy's overall health and the Fed's next moves.

One thing that investors will be watching closely in the coming weeks is how the Fed responds to the latest data. The central bank has been signaling that it could begin to taper its asset purchases as early as this year, but some economists now believe that this could be delayed as a result of the latest jobs report.

The Fed has made it clear that it will not begin to raise interest rates until it is confident that the labor market is fully healed, and that inflation is running sustainably above 2%. While the latest jobs data shows that the labor market is continuing to recover from the pandemic, it is unclear whether this will be enough to convince the Fed to move forward with its plans to taper asset purchases.

Some analysts argue that the Fed will want to see more data before it takes any further action. They point to the fact that the unemployment rate remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, and that there are still millions of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed. Additionally, inflation has been running above the Fed's target of 2% for several months, and could continue to rise if the economy overheats.

However, others argue that the Fed will move ahead with tapering despite the weaker-than-expected jobs report. They point to the fact that the labor market is continuing to recover, and that there are signs that the economy is growing at a healthy clip. Furthermore, they argue that the Fed may be looking to get ahead of inflation, as it could pose a risk to the economy if left unchecked.

The bond market reaction to the report was also mixed, as investors tried to adjust their expectations of future interest rate hikes. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note initially fell on the news, suggesting that investors were taking a more cautious approach to the economy's prospects. However, the yield rebounded later in the day as some investors appeared to be more optimistic about the outlook.

While the stock and bond markets have been reacting to the latest jobs data, other sectors of the economy are also likely to be impacted by the report. For example, the housing market could be affected, as the report suggests that there could be more demand for homes in the coming months. Additionally, the report could impact consumer behavior, as people adjust their spending patterns based on their employment situation.

Overall, the latest US jobs report shows that the labor market is continuing to heal from the pandemic, but there are still challenges ahead. Investors will be watching closely in the coming weeks to see how the Fed responds to the data, and what implications this could have for the wider economy. For now, the mixed market reactions suggest that there is still some uncertainty about the path ahead.",1
68,Third teenage suspect arrested in Florida triple homicide,"In what appears to be a gruesome act of violence, three people were found dead in a home in Frostproof, Florida, on Friday, July 17th. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office immediately launched an investigation which led to the arrest of two teenagers. Now, a third teenager has been taken into custody, bringing the total number of suspects to three.

The three victims include 23-year-old Damion Tillman, 30-year-old Keven Springfield, and 27-year-old Brandon Rollins. They were reportedly going fishing in the remote area of Lake Streety in Frostproof when they were killed. The exact motive for the crime remains unclear, but the police suspect it was a botched robbery attempt.

On Wednesday, a day after the arrest of the first two teenage suspects, a third 17-year-old was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder. The latest arrest comes as the police continue their search for at least one additional suspect.

According to the Polk County Sheriff, Grady Judd, the investigation is ongoing and more arrests are likely. “These three guys are absolutely evil incarnate,” Judd said of the three suspects already in custody. He went on to explain that the suspects did not know the victims, but had seen them at a nearby Dollar General store earlier that day and decided to follow them to the fishing spot.

The details of the crime are still emerging, but Judd gave a graphic account of what happened based on information gathered from the suspects. Apparently, the three victims were beaten, shot, and left for dead. When one of them managed to call his father, the suspects returned to finish the job. “These are cold, calculated murders,” Judd said.

The investigation is complex and involves multiple law enforcement agencies. The police have been canvassing the area for witnesses and conducting forensic analysis of the crime scene. They have also been reviewing surveillance footage from nearby businesses and homes.

The community of Frostproof is in shock over the brutality of the crime. Tillman, Springfield, and Rollins were all known and liked in the area. They were described as hard-working and kind-hearted individuals. “They were just out to have a good time,” said Judd. “They didn’t deserve this.”

The motive for the crime remains unclear, but Judd believes that it was a botched robbery attempt. He explained that the suspects had been planning the crime “for weeks” and had even stolen items from nearby homes to use as bait for the victims. “They were looking for somebody to rob and kill,” Judd said.

The three suspects are all teenagers, but Judd did not mince words when describing them. “These are not children,” he said. “These are murderers.” The suspects’ names have not been released due to their status as minors.

The police have praised the community for its cooperation and support during the investigation. They have received numerous tips and leads from residents and business owners in the area. The community has also come together to show its support for the families of the victims.

“It’s a small town, we all know each other,” said Janey Bentley, a local resident. “It’s just really sad, it’s heartbreaking.”

The murders have sparked a conversation about gun violence in Florida. The state has some of the most lenient gun laws in the country, which has led to concerns about public safety. Some have called for stricter gun control measures, while others argue that individual rights should not be hampered by government regulation.

Meanwhile, the families of the victims are struggling to come to terms with their loss. “It’s been a nightmare,” said Cyril Rollins, the father of Brandon Rollins. “It’s something you never expect to happen to you.”

As the investigation continues, the community of Frostproof is coming together to mourn and seek justice for the three young men who lost their lives in such a senseless and brutal way. Their memories will live on in the hearts of those who knew and loved them, and their deaths will not be forgotten.",1
69,Who is trans advocate Dylan Mulvaney?,"Who is Trans Advocate Dylan Mulvaney?

Dylan Mulvaney is a well-known trans rights advocate, activist, and educator. His work and activism have been widely recognized and celebrated in the LGBTQ+ community in the United States and beyond. He has been featured in several media outlets, including The New York Times, CNN, and The Advocate.

Mulvaney, who identifies as a transgender man, was born and raised in the United States. He grew up in a small town in the Midwest, where he experienced significant feelings of alienation and disconnection as a result of his gender identity. He came out as transgender when he was 16 years old, and since then, he has been working tirelessly to improve the lives of trans individuals in the United States and abroad.

Mulvaney's activism and advocacy work have focused on a wide range of issues affecting the trans community. He has worked to increase visibility and acceptance of trans individuals, to advocate for trans-inclusive policies and legislation, and to fight against discrimination and violence targeting the trans community.

One of Mulvaney's most significant accomplishments has been his work in the field of education. He has created and implemented numerous training programs and workshops designed to educate individuals and organizations about the needs, experiences, and perspectives of trans individuals. Through his training programs, Mulvaney seeks to promote understanding and empathy, reduce discrimination and harassment, and create more welcoming and inclusive environments for trans individuals in all areas of society.

Mulvaney's passion for education is grounded in his own experiences as a trans individual. In interviews, he has spoken about the challenges he faced as a student and about the importance of creating supportive and inclusive learning environments for trans students. Mulvaney has worked with schools and universities across the country to develop policies and programs that support trans students and to train faculty and staff on how to create a safe and welcoming environment for trans students.

Mulvaney's work as an educator has received widespread recognition and praise. In 2017, he was named one of Forbes' ""30 Under 30"" in education, and he has received numerous other awards and accolades for his work in this field.

Another area of focus for Mulvaney has been advocating for trans individuals in the healthcare system. Healthcare is an especially challenging area for trans individuals, given the many systemic barriers and prejudices they may face. Mulvaney has worked to increase access to healthcare for trans individuals, to improve the quality of care they receive, and to promote trans-inclusive policies and guidelines within the healthcare industry.

Mulvaney's advocacy work in the healthcare field has led to significant changes and improvements. For example, he worked with a group of trans activists to create the first-ever set of guidelines for providing healthcare to trans individuals, which have been adopted by healthcare organizations across the country. He has also been involved in advocating for trans individuals to be covered by insurance plans and for insurance companies to cover gender-affirming care.

Mulvaney's advocacy work has not been limited to the United States. He has worked with trans activists and organizations around the world to promote trans rights and visibility. He has spoken at conferences and events in various countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and he has worked with international organizations, such as the United Nations, on trans-inclusive policies and initiatives.

Mulvaney's work as an advocate and activist has been incredibly impactful, but it has also come with personal costs. He has faced harassment, threats, and discrimination because of his gender identity and his activism. In interviews, he has spoken about the toll this has taken on him and on his mental health.

Despite these challenges, Mulvaney remains committed to his work and his activism. In interviews, he has emphasized the importance of visibility and advocacy work in achieving trans rights and equality.

Mulvaney's work has already had a significant impact on the trans community and on society more broadly. However, much work remains to be done before trans individuals are truly accepted and valued as equals. Mulvaney's work serves as an inspiration and a call to action for all those who believe in equality and justice for all.",1
70,The city without TikTok offers a window to America's potential future,"In the summer of 2020, TikTok, the popular social media platform, found itself at the center of a geopolitical storm. The United States government, led by President Donald Trump, was concerned about the app's potential links to the Chinese government and its ability to collect data on American citizens. Trump signed an executive order that would ban the app from the country, but its implementation was halted by a court ruling.

Throughout the controversy, one American city stood out as a curious outlier: Jackson, Mississippi. This mid-sized Southern city of roughly 160,000 people never really caught on to the TikTok craze. There were few, if any, local ""influencers"" or viral dance trends originating from the area. For many of its residents, the app's potential ban was met with a collective shrug.

But for some observers, Jackson's TikTok-free status was a fascinating case study in a larger question: what would America look like without the massive influence of social media?

To answer that question, it's worth examining Jackson in greater detail. What sets this city apart from the hundreds of other towns and cities that have embraced TikTok and other social media platforms?

To begin with, Jackson is something of a digital desert. According to a 2019 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, only 44% of adults in the city owned smartphones, compared to 81% nationwide. Additionally, Jackson's median household income is significantly lower than the national average, which can make the cost of data plans and high-end smartphones prohibitive for many residents.

Furthermore, Jackson's demographics are atypical when compared to the larger social media landscape. The city is majority-black, and its residents skew older than the typical TikTok user. It's possible that these factors could contribute to a lack of interest in the platform.

So, what does life in Jackson look like without TikTok? For one, it's simpler. The city's nightlife scene is largely built around live music and other performance events, rather than post-worthy bars and clubs. People's social lives are more likely to revolve around church activities, community events, and family gatherings.

It's also worth noting that Jackson's lack of social media presence doesn't mean its residents are technologically cut off from the world. Facebook and Instagram are still popular, as are messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal.

But these more traditional forms of online communication lack the urgency and compulsive appeal of TikTok, which can suck hours of a user's day with endless scrolling and swiping. It's easy to imagine that without the siren call of TikTok, Jackson's residents have more time for face-to-face interactions, hobbies, and other activities.

Of course, Jackson is just one city, and extrapolating its experience to the entire country is a risky proposition. After all, even in Jackson, there are people who use TikTok and other social media platforms regularly. And for many Americans, social media has served as a vital lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing people to stay connected with loved ones and work remotely.

But it's worth considering the larger implications of social media's influence on our society. A generation of Americans has been raised on platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, where likes, followers, and views are the currency of popularity. It's not hard to see how this could contribute to a certain superficiality and performative nature in our relationships and interactions.

Furthermore, social media has proven to be a potent force in politics, with the ability to amplify voices and movements in previously unimaginable ways. While this has led to some positive change, it has also fueled division, harassment, and misinformation.

It's worth asking ourselves what kind of America we want to live in. Do we want a country where our relationships, values, and identities are molded by algorithms and corporate interests? Or do we want a country where we can engage with each other authentically and meaningfully, without the filter of screens and likes?

The answer to these questions is not simple or straightforward. But perhaps we can find some guidance by looking at places like Jackson, where the absence of social media offers a glimpse of what an alternate future might look like.",1
71,Alibaba unveils its ChatGPT-style service,"Alibaba, one of China's most valuable tech companies, has unveiled a new chatbot feature called ChatGPT-style service. This announcement comes at a time when chatbots are becoming increasingly popular in e-commerce and other sectors.

Alibaba's ChatGPT-style service is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) chatbot that can respond to inquiries, answer questions, and offer personalized recommendations to customers. The chatbot is designed to learn from previous interactions with customers and can use this information to provide better recommendations in the future.

According to Alibaba, the new chatbot is based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, which is a sophisticated deep learning algorithm that has been used for many NLP applications. This model allows the ChatGPT-style service to understand natural language and generate responses that are contextually relevant and suitable for each customer's needs.

Alibaba's new chatbot is expected to provide a more intuitive and personalized customer experience to online shoppers. The chatbot can offer product recommendations, provide information on products, and answer any queries that customers may have. The feature will be integrated into Alibaba's various e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and Tmall.

The new chatbot is seen as a significant move by Alibaba towards adopting advanced AI technologies to improve its e-commerce business. Alibaba has been investing in AI technology for several years and has already developed many advanced AI-based services, such as image recognition, voice recognition, and machine translation.

Alibaba's focus on AI technology has helped the company to maintain its position as a market leader in China's e-commerce market. The Chinese tech giant has been working on developing AI-based services that can provide a cutting-edge customer experience, giving it a significant competitive advantage over its rivals.

The ChatGPT-style service is part of Alibaba's broader efforts to develop more sophisticated AI-based services that can enhance e-commerce experiences. The company's AI researchers are working on developing chatbots that can fully understand the nuances of human language, making it possible to offer more personalised recommendations and support to customers.

According to the company, the ChatGPT-style service has already been tested in some of its e-commerce platforms and has received positive feedback from users. The chatbot is expected to become more intelligent as it interacts with more customers, making it possible to offer more personalized advice and recommendations.

The development of chatbots is part of a wider trend in the e-commerce sector towards adopting advanced AI technologies to optimize and personalize the shopper experience. Companies such as Amazon and Walmart have already deployed chatbots as part of their online shopping experience, and they have proven to be effective in improving customer engagement and sales.

However, Alibaba's advanced AI technology, coupled with its knowledge of the Chinese market, gives it a significant advantage in the online shopping space. The company's expertise in AI technology, coupled with its massive customer base, makes it well-positioned to capitalize on the growth in online shopping and gain a significant edge over its rivals.

Alibaba's ChatGPT-style service also highlights the importance of NLP in chatbots. NLP is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. This technology makes it possible for chatbots to understand and interpret human language, allowing them to provide contextually relevant responses to customers.

The development of NLP-based chatbots is still in its early stages, but the technology already has numerous applications in the e-commerce sector. With more advanced NLP-based chatbots, companies can offer more personalized recommendations and support to customers, improving customer engagement and loyalty.

Alibaba's ChatGPT-style service is also significant as it demonstrates the importance of AI technology for companies to compete effectively in the global economy. As AI technology becomes more advanced, companies that fail to adopt AI-enabled services risk falling behind their competitors.

In conclusion, Alibaba's new ChatGPT-style service is a significant development in the e-commerce space, providing a more personalized and engaging shopping experience for customers. The chatbot is expected to become more intelligent as it interacts with more customers, making it possible to offer more personalized advice and recommendations. As more companies invest in AI technology, it is clear that AI will be a crucial technology for companies to stay competitive in the global economy.",1
72,This Chicago doctor donated her kidney to a woman in Virginia she'd never met,"This heart-warming and selfless act of kindness reminds us all of the power of generosity and the altruistic nature of humankind. Dr. Olivia Williams, a medical professional based in the bustling city of Chicago, recently donated one of her kidneys to a woman in Virginia whom she had never met before. Her actions have been hailed as a symbol of compassion and the ultimate embodiment of living for others. 

Dr. Williams' journey began in early 2019, when she heard about a woman in Virginia who was in desperate need of a kidney transplant. The recipient, whose name has been withheld for confidentiality reasons, had been struggling with kidney failure for several months and was on a waiting list for a donor organ. Despite her proactive efforts in seeking a transplant, her prospects began to dim as her medical condition continued to worsen.

It was at this juncture that Dr. Williams, a specialist in internal medicine and nephrology, stepped up and offered to donate one of her kidneys to the woman. Upon hearing about the patient's plight, she immediately contacted the hospital in Virginia where the woman was being treated and volunteered to undergo the donation process. This came as a complete surprise to the recipient, who had never personally met Dr. Williams before.

The transplant took place in mid-2019, and both Dr. Williams and the recipient have since fully recovered from the surgery. In an interview with CNN, Dr. Williams expressed her joy at having been able to help someone in such a profound way. ""It was a life-changing experience for me,"" she said. ""To be able to donate a kidney and potentially save someone's life is an indescribable feeling.""

Dr. Williams' decision to donate her kidney to a stranger may seem unconventional, but it is not entirely uncommon. According to data from the National Kidney Foundation, there are currently over 100,000 people in the United States who are waiting for kidney transplants. Unfortunately, the demand for donor organs far outweighs the supply, resulting in a significant shortage of available kidneys for transplantation. In 2018, only 21,167 kidney transplants were performed, leaving tens of thousands of patients without the lifesaving treatment they need.

The situation has spurred a growing movement of altruistic kidney donors, like Dr. Williams, who donate their organs to complete strangers in order to help those in need. These donors are often motivated by a sense of empathy and community, recognizing that they have the power to make a profound difference in someone else's life.

Dr. Williams' act of kindness has not gone unnoticed. Her story has been shared widely on social media and has received countless messages of support and gratitude from people around the world. Many have praised her for embodying the spirit of giving and emphasized the importance of organ donation in saving lives.

The transplant experience also had a profound impact on the recipient. In a statement to CNN, she expressed her profound gratitude for Dr. Williams' generosity. ""This selfless act has given me a second chance at life,"" she said. ""I will always be thankful to her for her kindness and her willingness to help a stranger.""

Dr. Williams' story is an inspiration to us all, reminding us of the power of empathy and the importance of supporting one another during times of need. Her act of kindness has not only saved a life but has also sparked a wave of hope and positivity that is sorely needed in today's world.

The decision to donate an organ, whether to someone you know personally or a complete stranger, is not one to be taken lightly. It requires extensive evaluation and medical screening to ensure that both the donor and recipient are in good health and that the transplant will be successful. For those interested in becoming an altruistic kidney donor, organizations such as the National Kidney Registry provide information and resources on the process.

Organ donation is a lifesaving gesture that can have a profound impact on those in need. It is an act of kindness that Dr. Williams has generously shared with the world. Her example inspires us all to consider our own capacity for giving and to recognize that we all have the potential to make a difference in someone else's life.",1
73,People we've lost in 2023,"Unfortunately, as time passes, we continue to lose many important and influential figures in our world. From celebrities and politicians to athletes and scientists, the year 2023 has not been any different. These individuals have left a lasting impact on society, and their legacies will continue to live on.

Politicians:

One of the most prominent political figures who we lost in 2023 was former United States Senator John Warner. He served as a Republican senator from Virginia for 30 years, from 1979 to 2009. Warner was known for his moderate positions, his work on national security issues, and his closeness with military leaders.

Another political figure we lost in 2023 was former Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He served as India's Prime Minister three times, from 1996 to 2004. Vajpayee was known for his statesmanship, his ability to build alliances, and his efforts towards peace with Pakistan.

Celebrities:

Sadly, the entertainment industry lost several beloved celebrities in 2023. One of the most notable figures was actor Michael K. Williams.

74,Here's why 'Shark Tank' star says small banks won't be around in 24 months,"""Shark Tank"" star and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has sounded a warning for small banks, saying they may not be around in the next two years.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Cuban argued that small banks would struggle to survive in a changing financial landscape. He pointed to the rise of fintech companies and the increasing use of online banking as major challenges for smaller financial institutions.

""If you're a small bank, you're going to have to merge. You're going to have to find a way to compete because you're not going to be able to afford the technology,"" Cuban said.

The pandemic has accelerated the trend towards online banking, with many customers ditching in-person banking in favor of digital options. According to a survey conducted by fintech firm Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), 45% of banking customers said they plan to visit bank branches less often even after the pandemic ends.

Cuban's warning comes amid a broader transformation of the banking industry. Large financial institutions have been investing heavily in technology in recent years, while fintech startups have gained significant market share.

Small banks may find it difficult to keep up with the pace of change, Cuban argued. ""They don't have the resources, they don't have the personnel, they don't have the infrastructure, they don't have the scale,"" he said.

It remains to be seen whether Cuban's prediction will come true, but one thing is clear: small banks will need to adapt in order to survive.",1
75,Analysis: 'Tone deaf' Macron faces backlash over Taiwan comments,"French President Emmanuel Macron has faced a barrage of criticism for his recent remarks about Taiwan, with critics saying his comments were ""tone deaf"" and threatened to undermine French credibility on the global stage.

Macron made the controversial comments during a recent interview with Taiwanese media, in which he referred to Taiwan as a ""state"" and pledged to support the island's bid for greater international recognition.

Many experts and politicians have criticized Macron's remarks, arguing that they disregarded the ""One China"" policy that France adheres to, which recognizes the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government and regards Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory.

""Macron's comments were ill-advised and showed a lack of understanding of the complex relationship between China, Taiwan, and the international community,"" said Zhao Qizheng, a former Chinese government spokesman and current vice chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

""His remarks not only violate the One China policy, but also could harm the overall bilateral relationship between China and France.""

Taiwan is a self-ruled island that Beijing considers to be a breakaway province, with no right to state-to-state relations. China has increasingly ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure to isolate Taiwan and get countries to downgrade or sever their relations with Taipei.

Despite this pressure, a growing number of countries have been willing to recognize Taiwan or support its bid for greater international recognition. Taiwan has formal diplomatic ties with just 15 countries, mainly small and impoverished nations in Latin America and the Pacific, while China has diplomatic relations with more than 170 countries.

France does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but it maintains close economic and cultural ties with the island that date back to the early 20th century. France is also home to a significant Taiwanese expatriate community and has been a vocal advocate for Taiwan's participation in international forums and organizations.

In his interview, Macron expressed support for Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations, saying that Taiwan's exclusion from these bodies was a ""political and non-scientific decision"" that needed to be rectified.

""Taiwan is a state that must have its place in the international community,"" Macron said during the interview with Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS. ""We have to respect the balance between China, which is a great power, and Taiwan, which is a democracy that has the right to live freely with its choices.""

The comments were widely condemned by Chinese officials and state media, with the Foreign Ministry accusing Macron of ""interfering in China's internal affairs"" and issuing a stern warning against any attempts to support Taiwan's independence or separatist forces.

""We urge the French side to abide by the One China principle and the commitments it has made to China, be prudent in its words and deeds, and not to provide any support or platform for Taiwan's separatist forces,"" ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a press briefing.

The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, also published an editorial calling Macron's remarks ""arrogant and ignorant,"" and warning that they could lead to a backlash against French companies doing business in China.

""Macron's Taiwan adventure is not cost-free,"" the editorial read. ""French companies, including Airbus and Carrefour, are heavily invested in China, and the Chinese market is crucial for their profits. If the French government continues to pander to Taiwan secessionists, it will face retaliation from China.""

Many experts say that Macron's remarks reflected a lack of awareness of the significant geopolitical and economic implications of the One China policy, as well as the complex dynamics between Taiwan, China, and the international community.

""Some Western politicians tend to view the Taiwan issue through the prism of democracy and human rights, and ignore the historical and strategic factors that underpin China's position on Taiwan,"" said Gao Feng, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

""These politicians need to recognize that Taiwan is not just a political issue, but also a vital national security and reunification issue for China. Any attempt to undermine China's sovereignty over Taiwan is deemed as a red line that China will not tolerate.""

Despite the backlash, some observers argue that Macron's comments could add momentum to Taiwan's international campaign to secure greater recognition and participation in global institutions.

""The fact that a major European leader like Macron is openly supporting Taiwan's bid for international recognition is significant, and could help to tip the balance in favor of Taipei,"" said Lin Chong-pin, a former deputy defense minister of Taiwan.

""France is a prominent member of the EU and has significant influence in the UN and other international organizations. Its support for Taiwan could help to galvanize other countries to follow suit and acknowledge Taiwan's rightful place in the international community.""

The controversy over Macron's remarks highlights the growing importance of Taiwan in the international arena, as well as the challenges that China faces in maintaining its influence over the island.

As Taiwan continues to assert its sovereignty and promote its democratic values, China is likely to ramp up its efforts to undermine Taiwan's international standing and pressure other countries to toe its line on the One China policy.

However, as Macron's comments have shown, some countries are willing to take a stand against China's bullying tactics and support Taiwan's right to participate fully in the international community.

As the global landscape continues to shift and evolve, the question of Taiwan's status and its place in the world will remain a contentious and complex issue, with far-reaching implications for regional stability and global governance.",1
76,US health officials aim to 'transform' Alzheimer's disease research with $300 million data platform,"In an effort to accelerate the development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced the creation of a $300 million data platform, which will serve as a central hub for researchers to share and access clinical data related to the disease.

This move marks a significant step forward in the effort to combat Alzheimer's, a debilitating and often fatal neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Currently, there are no effective therapies for the disease, which is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes.

According to the NIH, the new platform will be designed to ""transform"" Alzheimer's research by making large amounts of data available to researchers in a standardized format, allowing for faster and more efficient analysis of clinical trial results, as well as providing insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of the disease.

""The Alzheimer's disease research community is hungry for data, and this platform will provide a valuable resource to support a variety of research efforts,"" said Richard J. Hodes, M.D., director of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), part of the NIH.

The platform will be created in collaboration with private partners, including the pharmaceutical industry, academic institutions, and advocacy groups. It will include data from clinical trials conducted by both public and private organizations, as well as information from animal studies and other experimental systems.

The NIH will host the platform and provide governance and oversight for data access and use. The platform will be managed by a data coordinating center, which will ensure that data is securely stored, standardized, and made accessible to qualified researchers.

One of the key benefits of the platform will be its ability to facilitate collaboration among researchers from different disciplines and organizations. By providing a centralized hub for data exchange and analysis, the platform will help to break down the ""silos"" that often exist in scientific research, and allow for more effective sharing of resources and expertise.

""The Alzheimer's research community recognizes that no single entity can solve the complex challenges posed by this disease,"" said Eliezer Masliah, M.D., director of the Division of Neuroscience at the National Institute on Aging. ""This platform will bring together researchers from all corners of the field, and help to break down the barriers that have impeded progress in the past.""

The platform is part of a broader effort by the NIH to accelerate the pace of Alzheimer's research, which has been hampered in recent years by a lack of funding and a limited understanding of the underlying biology of the disease. The NIH has committed $1.8 billion to Alzheimer's research in the current fiscal year, an increase of $425 million over the previous year.

The NIH has also launched a number of new initiatives aimed at accelerating the development of effective therapies for the disease. One such initiative is the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP), a public-private collaboration aimed at identifying new targets and biomarkers for drug development.

AMP includes partnerships with several pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic institutions and advocacy groups. The goal of the partnership is to identify new biomarkers that can be used to better diagnose and treat the disease, as well as to identify new therapeutic targets for drug development.

Another key initiative launched by the NIH is the Geroscience Initiative, which aims to better understand the biological mechanisms of aging and how they contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's. The initiative is focused on studying the basic biological processes that drive aging, with the aim of developing new therapies that can reverse or delay the aging process.

Despite these efforts, Alzheimer's remains one of the most challenging and complex diseases facing the research community today. It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's, and that number is expected to triple by 2050.

The disease imposes a significant burden on patients, their families, and the healthcare system as a whole. According to the Alzheimer's Association, the cost of caring for patients with the disease is expected to reach $259 billion in 2017, a figure that is projected to rise to $1.1 trillion by 2050.

The creation of a centralized data platform represents a major step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's, and is expected to have a significant impact on the pace and efficacy of research efforts going forward. By providing a shared resource for data analysis and collaboration, the platform has the potential to unlock new insights into the biology of the disease and to accelerate the development of new treatments and therapies.

""The creation of this data platform is a key milestone in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, and represents a major investment in the future of Alzheimer's research,"" said Hodes. ""We are committed to working with our partners to ensure that this platform is used to its fullest potential, and to advancing our understanding of this devastating disease.""

As the effort to combat Alzheimer's disease continues to intensify, the creation of this new data platform represents a major advance in the ability of researchers to collaborate, share data, and make progress in the fight against this devastating disease. With the help of private partners, academic institutions, and advocacy groups, the NIH is leading the charge in transforming Alzheimer's research and unlocking new insights into the biology of the disease.",1
77,"Snoopy is real! Meet Bayley, the cartoon dog's doppelganger","In the world of beloved cartoon characters, few have captured the hearts of audiences as Snoopy from the Peanuts comic strip. For decades, he's been a symbol of imagination, good cheer, and canine loyalty. But many may not realize that Snoopy's whimsical spirit is not just a product of artist Charles Schulz's imagination. In fact, Snoopy is real -- or at least he has a real-life doppelganger named Bayley.

Bayley is a beagle from Massachusetts that has taken the internet by storm in recent years with his uncanny resemblance to Snoopy. From his fluffy ears to his distinctive black and white markings, Bayley is the spitting image of the fictional cartoon character that has captured the hearts of millions.

Owners, father-daughter duo John and Olivia Sapienza, say they didn't realize Bayley's resemblance to Snoopy until they began receiving comments and messages on social media from strangers. ""People would stop us on the street and say, 'Oh my gosh, he looks just like Snoopy!'"" Olivia remarked.

The family launched Bayley's Instagram account to share his adventures and charm with the world, and within a short period, he quickly amassed thousands of followers. Today, Bayley has over 91,000 followers that show their appreciation towards him through likes and comments.

Bayley's charm extends beyond his looks as he is full of personality. The beagle is a natural entertainer and loves to pose for the camera. Whether dressed up in fun costumes or lounging in silly positions, Bayley's antics have made him a beloved canine celebrity on social media platforms.

But Bayley and Snoopy share more than just physical characteristics; they also share a similar spirit. Both are known for their playful, mischievous natures and an unwavering loyalty to their families. In fact, the Sapienzas say Bayley's character is one of the reasons why they believe he has captured the hearts of so many people.

""He's a happy-go-lucky dog,"" John said. ""He loves to play, and he's always happy. We think people see that in him and feel comforted by it.""

The connection between Bayley and Snoopy extends beyond surface-level similarities. Charles Schulz's creation was beloved by many in part because he represented something deeper than just humor or cute illustrations. Snoopy was a representation of the imagination and the joys of childhood, embodying the playful spirit that so many of us lose as we grow older.

In many ways, Bayley offers that same sort of joy to his fans. His playful personality and whimsical photos are a reminder that even when life is tough, we can always find reasons to smile.

Bayley's story is also a testament to the power of social media, which can bring people together and create joyful moments even in the darkest times. ""We never expected anything like this,"" Olivia said. ""It's been a wild ride, and we're just grateful for all the love and support we've received.""

For many who grew up with the Peanuts comic strips, Bayley's resemblance to Snoopy is like a real-life manifestation of a childhood icon. Fans of the comics often see themselves in Charlie Brown or identify with Lucy's bossiness, but Snoopy was different. He was a pure expression of joy and whimsy, a reminder to embrace our imaginations and to never lose our inner child.

In some ways, Bayley embodies that same spirit. When scrolling through his Instagram page, it's impossible not to smile at the sight of his playful antics or to feel comforted by the simplicity of his charm.

While Snoopy may have been a fictional character, his impact on our collective imaginations has been real. And in Bayley, we see a tangible representation of that impact, a reminder of the joy and whimsy that cartoon dogs can inspire in our hearts.

In a world that can often feel dark and overwhelming, Bayley's resemblance to Snoopy is more than just a coincidence or a novelty. It's a symbol of hope, a reminder that joy and imagination can still be found even in the most unexpected places.

As Bayley's fame continues to grow, it's clear that his impact on our collective imaginations will only continue to deepen. And in that way, he proves that Snoopy was right all along. Sometimes the most profound truths come from the simplest, most innocent of sources.",1
78,ABBA's long-term guitarist Lasse Wellander dies,"ABBA’s longtime guitarist Lasse Wellander has died at the age of 68. Wellander, who had been battling cancer, played with the Swedish pop group for over a decade and was instrumental in shaping the band’s iconic sound.

Wellander’s death was announced on Monday on the official ABBA Facebook page. The statement read: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Lasse Wellander, our friend and longtime guitarist. Lasse played an integral role in shaping ABBA’s sound, and his contributions will never be forgotten. We send our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends during this difficult time.”

Wellander first worked with ABBA in 1977 when he played guitar on the band’s hit single “The Name of the Game.” He went on to work with the group on many of their most successful albums, including “Voulez-Vous,” “Super Trouper,” and “The Visitors.”

Wellander’s signature guitar work can be heard on some of ABBA’s most beloved tracks, such as “Chiquitita,” “Take a Chance on Me,” and “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight).” His innovative playing style, which blended rock, funk, and disco influences, was key to the band’s distinctive sound.

Wellander was born on May 13, 1953 in Stockholm, Sweden. He began playing guitar at the age of 12 and eventually became one of Sweden’s most respected musicians. He worked with a wide range of artists during his long career, including Carola Häggkvist, Tomas Ledin, and Peter Jöback.

Despite his success as a session musician, Wellander was known for his low-key personality and down-to-earth attitude. In a 2013 interview with the Swedish newspaper Expressen, he spoke about his longevity in the music industry. “I’ve been playing for over 40 years now, but I still feel like I’m just getting started,” he said. “There’s always something new to learn, always new challenges to face.”

Wellander’s death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from fans, fellow musicians, and ABBA members. Benny Andersson, ABBA’s keyboardist and one of the band’s main songwriters, wrote on Facebook: “Lasse was a fantastic, talented musician and a dear friend. He was essential to our sound and our success, and we will never forget him.”

Frida Lyngstad, one of ABBA’s lead singers, also remembered Wellander in a statement released on Monday. “Lasse was an extraordinary musician who brought so much to our music,” she said. “His guitar work was always brilliant, always fresh, always exciting. He will be sorely missed.”

Wellander’s passing comes just weeks after the release of “Abba: Voyage,” the band’s first album in 40 years. The album, which features new recordings of classic ABBA songs, has been praised by critics and fans alike.

While Wellander did not play on the new album, his presence was felt in the music. The band paid tribute to him during their recent concert at London’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, with Andersson dedicating a performance of “The Name of the Game” to his late friend and collaborator.

Wellander’s influence on ABBA’s music cannot be overstated. His inventive guitar playing helped to define the band’s sound and made their music instantly recognizable. Though he may be gone, his legacy lives on through the timeless songs he helped to create.",1
79,Drugs suspect escapes Hong Kong court by switching wristbands with another man,"In a daring escape from a Hong Kong court, a drugs suspect managed to evade authorities by switching wristbands with another man. The incident, which is the latest in a string of brazen escapes from detention centers and courts around the world, has raised questions about the security measures in place to prevent such occurrences.

The incident took place on Monday, August 23rd, when the suspect, identified only as ""Mr. Chan,"" was due to appear in court on charges of drug possession and trafficking. According to reports, Chan had been in custody since March of this year, and was being held at the CSD headquarters in Ho Man Tin, Kowloon.

As he was being escorted into the courtroom, Chan allegedly managed to switch his wristband with that of another man who was also present in the area. This allowed him to take the place of the other man, who was apparently due to appear in court on a different matter.

Once inside the courtroom, Chan reportedly sat quietly for some time, before suddenly springing up and bolting out of the room. He was pursued by several court guards, but managed to escape by running down a nearby stairwell and exiting the building.

Authorities are now searching for Chan, who is believed to be armed and dangerous. They have issued a public warning advising residents to lock their doors and stay indoors, and have set up roadblocks and checkpoints around the city in an attempt to apprehend the suspect.

The escape has caused widespread concern about the security of detention centers and courtrooms in Hong Kong. Many have called for increased measures to be put in place, including the use of more advanced technology and tighter security screenings for visitors and staff.

This is not the first time that a detainee has successfully escaped from a Hong Kong court or detention center. In 2016, two men escaped from the Shek Pik Detention Center by scaling a wall, while in 2018, a suspect managed to flee from a high-security courtroom by feigning illness and being escorted out of the room by medical staff.

These incidents highlight the need for improved security measures and protocols, particularly in high-risk areas such as detention centers and courtrooms. It is clear that authorities must take swift action to prevent further such occurrences, and to safeguard the public against the threat posed by dangerous suspects on the loose.

Some have also speculated that the incident may be linked to the ongoing political unrest in Hong Kong. The city has been rocked by protests and demonstrations for several years, as residents demand greater autonomy and democratic freedoms from Beijing.

It is possible that Chan, who is believed to have ties to organized crime syndicates in the area, may have been aided in his escape by outside forces seeking to destabilize the city and undermine the rule of law.

However, authorities have not yet confirmed any such connection, and are continuing to investigate the matter. In the meantime, residents are being urged to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the authorities.

The incident has also raised questions about the use of wristbands and other forms of identification in detention centers and courtrooms. While these are intended to enhance security and prevent escape attempts, they appear to have been easily circumvented by the suspect in this case.

Some experts have suggested that more advanced technologies, such as biometric scanners and facial recognition systems, may be more effective in preventing escape attempts and deterring criminal activity. However, these measures can be costly and may raise concerns about privacy and civil liberties.

Ultimately, the key to preventing further such incidents will be a comprehensive and coordinated approach to security, including the use of technology, staff training, and information sharing between law enforcement agencies. Only through a concerted effort can we hope to safeguard our communities against the threats posed by dangerous criminals on the loose.",1
80,Brandon Lee's loved ones remember 'The Crow' star 30 years after his death,"Brandon Lee's loved ones remember 'The Crow' star 30 years after his death

It has been 30 years since Brandon Lee, the son of legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, passed away while filming his breakthrough movie ""The Crow"" in 1993. Lee was just 28 years old when he was killed on set due to a tragic accident involving a prop gun.

Today, Brandon's legacy lives on through his contributions to the film industry, as well as the memories shared by his closest friends and family members, who continue to honor his life and work.

Born on February 1, 1965, in Oakland, California, Brandon Lee was the son of Bruce Lee and Linda Lee Cadwell. Raised in Hong Kong, he spent much of his teenage years studying martial arts and eventually became a skilled practitioner of kung fu and Jeet Kune Do, his father's martial arts form.

After graduating from high school in the United States, Lee went on to attend Emerson College in Boston, where he studied theater and eventually pursued a career in acting.

Despite initial reluctance from his father, who had been a trailblazer in the martial arts film genre, Brandon Lee landed his big break in the film industry with his leading role in ""Rapid Fire"" in 1992. He had also earned critical praise for his role in ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" in 1991.

But it was his final film ""The Crow"" that cemented his place as a rising star in Hollywood. Lee played the character of Eric Draven, a musician who is killed and comes back to life one year later to seek revenge on the gang who killed him and his fiancée.

Tragically, Lee was killed on set in the final days of filming when a blank bullet was accidentally lodged in a prop gun and fired during a scene. He was rushed to the hospital but died later that night.

Despite his short-lived career, Lee's influence on the film industry and his fans has endured for decades. As we mark the 30th anniversary of his death, we take a look back at Brandon Lee's life and his legacy, as told by the people who knew him best.

Linda Lee Cadwell, Brandon Lee's mother, reflects on her son's life

Linda Lee Cadwell has been a frequent spokesperson for her son, sharing her memories of his life in interviews and public events. In a recent interview with CNN, Cadwell remembered Brandon's early years and his relationship with his father, as well as his introduction to the world of acting.

""Brandon was very close to his father, Bruce,"" Cadwell said. ""He was very proud of his dad and his dad's legacy. When Bruce died, Brandon was only 8 years old. He didn't really understand what was going on or how big of a loss it was at the time.""

""As he got older, he began to understand that his dad was a true pioneer and that he had made a huge impact on the world,"" she added.

Lee found his passion for acting when he was a student at Emerson and starred in several student productions. Cadwell recalled that Brandon's father was initially hesitant about his son pursuing acting, but ultimately supported him in his endeavors.

""His father was always very supportive of his children and their interests,"" Cadwell said. ""When Brandon wanted to pursue acting, Bruce wasn't sure if that was the right path for him. But he ultimately trusted his son's judgment and allowed him to follow his dreams.""

Cadwell also spoke about Lee's role in ""The Crow"" and the impact it had on his life and career.

""Brandon loved playing the character of Eric Draven in 'The Crow,'"" she said. ""He felt like it was a role that he could really sink his teeth into and he was very passionate about bringing the character to life.""

Lee's death was a devastating blow to Cadwell, who has said that she struggled to cope with the loss of her son.

""It was a very difficult time for me and our family,"" she said. ""I don't think any parent can really prepare themselves for the loss of a child. It was like a part of me had been ripped away.""

""But I also know that Brandon wouldn't want us to dwell on his death,"" Cadwell added. ""He was always so full of life and energy, and I think he would want us to celebrate his life and remember all the wonderful things about him.""

Ernie Hudson, Lee's co-star in ""The Crow,"" remembers the actor's dedication to his craft

Ernie Hudson, who played the character of Sergeant Albrecht in ""The Crow,"" worked closely with Brandon Lee during the filming of the movie. In an interview with CNN, Hudson spoke about his experience working with Lee and remembered the actor's dedication to his craft.

""Brandon was a very serious actor,"" Hudson said. ""He was very committed to the role of Eric Draven and spent a lot of time preparing for the role.""

""He would study the pages of the script and really try to understand the character and his motivations,"" Hudson added. ""He was always looking for ways to make the performance more authentic and believable.""

Hudson also talked about the impact that Lee's death had on the cast and crew of the movie.

""It was a huge shock to all of us when Brandon passed away,"" he said. ""It was one of those moments that you never forget. We were all devastated and trying to process what had happened.""

""But at the same time, we were also trying to finish the movie and honor Brandon's legacy,"" Hudson added. ""We knew that he had poured his heart and soul into this project and we wanted to finish it in a way that he would have been proud of.""

Hudson praised Lee's talent and his impact on the film industry, saying that he believed the actor had a bright future ahead of him.

""Brandon was a gifted actor who had so much potential,"" Hudson said. ""I think he would have gone on to do some amazing things if he had been given the chance. But even though he was taken from us too soon, his influence continues to be felt in the movies he made and the people he touched.""

Shannon Lee, Brandon Lee's sister, shares her memories of growing up with her brother

Shannon Lee, Brandon Lee's younger sister, has also spoken openly about her brother's life and legacy. In a recent interview with CNN, she talked about their childhood together and the role that martial arts played in their lives.

""I think my brother and I had a pretty typical sibling relationship growing up,"" she said. ""We would argue and fight like any siblings, but at the end of the day we loved each other very much.""

Shannon remembered the influence that their father had on their lives and how he instilled a love of martial arts in both of his children.

""Our dad was very passionate about martial arts and wanted to share that love with us,"" she said. ""He would take us to kung fu tournaments and expose us to different cultures and experiences.""

Lee continued to study martial arts throughout his life and was known for incorporating the techniques he learned into his movie roles.

""He was very proud of his martial arts and always wanted to showcase his skills on screen,"" Shannon said. ""But at the same time, he was also a very talented actor who could bring characters to life in a way that was both powerful and emotional.""

Shannon also spoke about the impact that her brother's death has had on her family, and how they have come to terms with the loss over the years.

""It's been a long journey for us as a family, but we've learned to cope with the loss of Brandon in our own ways,"" she said. ""I think the biggest thing that's helped us is the knowledge that he would want us to be happy and to remember him with love.""

As we mark the 30th anniversary of Brandon Lee's death, his loved ones continue to honor his memory and celebrate the impact that he had on the world. Whether through his iconic movie roles, his dedication to his craft, or his love of martial arts, Lee's influence will continue to be felt for years to come.",1
81,Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's health deteriorates in prison amid poisoning accusations,"Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny's health is deteriorating rapidly in prison, according to his lawyers and supporters. The Kremlin critic, who survived a poisoning attack last year only to be jailed upon his return to Moscow in January, is now on hunger strike to protest against what he describes as unlawful and inhumane treatment in jail. Navalny's team claims that he is being denied proper medical treatment, is being subjected to sleep deprivation, and is not receiving adequate medical attention for severe back pains and numbness in his legs.

Navalny's deteriorating condition has sparked outrage in Russia and abroad, with international leaders and human rights groups calling for his release and better medical treatment. The situation has also reignited accusations that the Kremlin was behind the poisoning attack on Navalny last August, which he claims was ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the Kremlin's denial of any involvement in the attack, the European Union has imposed sanctions on several Russian officials and entities over Navalny's poisoning.

Navalny's current hunger strike began on March 31 in protest of what he says is the prison's refusal to allow him proper medical treatment. In a statement posted on his Instagram account, Navalny wrote that he was ""tempered like steel"" and would not back down until his demands were met. He called on ""thousands and millions of people"" to join him in his fight against the Russian government's ""lawlessness and outrage.""

In the weeks since the hunger strike began, Navalny's lawyers and supporters have reported that his health has deteriorated significantly. On April 5, Navalny's lawyers were denied access to him, which prompted protests outside the prison in which he is being held. According to his team, Navalny has lost 15 kilograms (33 pounds) since beginning the hunger strike and is experiencing severe pain in his back and legs. His lawyers have also reported that he has become ""incoherent"" at times and is suffering from a high fever and cough.

Navalny's team has called for his transfer to a hospital and for him to be examined by independent doctors. They have accused the Russian government of putting his life in danger and say that the prison is violating international human rights law by denying him access to proper medical care.

The Russian government has denied any mistreatment of Navalny and has accused him of seeking attention through his hunger strike. A government spokesperson said that Navalny was being given ""all necessary medical attention"" and that his condition was being monitored by prison doctors.

Navalny's situation has been the subject of much international attention, with world leaders and human rights groups voicing their concern for his health and safety. US President Joe Biden has called for Navalny's immediate release and said that the Russian government would be held accountable for any harm that comes to him. The European Union has also called for his release and has imposed sanctions on several Russian officials and entities over his poisoning.

The situation is particularly striking given that Navalny is one of the most prominent critics of the Russian government and has been a thorn in Putin's side for many years. Navalny rose to prominence in the late 2000s as an anti-corruption blogger and activist, and has been a vocal critic of Putin's regime ever since. He has been jailed multiple times, has been the subject of attacks and threats, and has had his family and associates targeted by the government.

Despite the risks, Navalny has continued to speak out against Putin and his allies, and has been a key figure in Russia's opposition movement. His poisoning last year was widely seen as an attempt to silence him and send a message to other dissidents that they too would be targeted. Navalny survived the attack after being treated in Germany, where doctors confirmed that he had been poisoned with a nerve agent.

Navalny's subsequent return to Russia in January, where he was immediately arrested and sentenced to jail time, sparked global condemnation and protests in Russia. His sentencing was widely seen as politically motivated and an effort by the government to silence him and his supporters.

Navalny's hunger strike is just the latest chapter in his ongoing battle against Putin's regime. Despite the risks, he has remained steadfast in his commitment to fighting for democracy and human rights in Russia. His situation has galvanized international attention and support, and has highlighted the ongoing struggle for freedom and justice in Russia.

As Navalny's health continues to deteriorate in prison, the world waits and watches to see how the Russian government will respond. Will Putin and his regime relent and provide Navalny with the medical care he needs, or will they continue to deny him access to proper treatment and put his life in further danger? The answer to that question may well determine the future of democracy and human rights in Russia, and the fate of one of Putin's most vocal critics.",1

83,Palestinian teen killed by Israeli forces in West Bank,"On Friday, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy was shot and killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank. According to Palestinian health officials, the teenager was hit in the stomach during a protest against Israeli settlements in the town of Beita.

The Israeli military stated that they were responding to what they called a ""violent riot"" and that they used ""riot dispersal methods"", including live fire, to control the situation. The Israeli army claims that the protest included the throwing of firebombs and rocks.

The incident has led to condemnation from Palestinian officials, who have accused Israel of using excessive force against peaceful protesters. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have defended their actions, stating that they were necessary to protect Israeli citizens and maintain order in the area.

This is just the latest incident in the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, which has seen violence escalate in recent weeks. The international community is calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and an end to the violence.",1

Chloe Bailey, one half of the singing duo Chloe x Halle, has been in the limelight since she was a child. From a young age, she has been passionate about music and has a soulful voice that has won over millions of fans.

Now, she is making her acting debut in the movie 'Praise This'. It's a musical comedy film directed by Universal Pictures and produced by Kenya Barris, who is known for his work in 'Black-ish' and 'Grown-ish'.

Chloe plays the role of Olivia, a young girl who is the lead singer in a gospel choir. The story is about a group of talented high school choir students who are trying to win a national championship. Along the way, they learn valuable lessons about friendship, teamwork, and faith.

Chloe talks about the impact that the film has had on her both personally and professionally.

""It was such a blessing to be a part of 'Praise This',"" she says. ""Not only did it give me the opportunity to showcase my acting skills, but it also allowed me to tap into my spiritual side and connect with God on a deeper level.""

Chloe grew up in a religious household and has been singing in her church choir since she was a child. She says that being a part of 'Praise This' helped her reconnect with that part of her life.

""I grew up singing in church, and being able to do that again in a film was really special to me,"" she says. ""It reminded me of the power of music and how it can bring people together and uplift them.""

The film's message of faith and perseverance also resonated with Chloe.

""I think the message of the film is really important,"" she says. ""It shows that no matter what obstacles you face, you can overcome them with faith and perseverance. That's a message that's relevant to everyone, regardless of their background or beliefs.""

Chloe has been making music with her sister Halle since they were young. They were discovered on YouTube by Beyoncé, who signed them to her label Parkwood Entertainment. Since then, they have released two critically acclaimed albums and have become known for their unique sound and style.

While music remains their main focus, Chloe says that acting is something she has always been interested in.

""I've always loved acting, and I've always wanted to explore that side of my creativity,"" she says. ""So when the opportunity to be a part of 'Praise This' came along, I jumped at it.""

Chloe says that the experience of filming the movie was both challenging and rewarding.

""It was definitely a learning experience,"" she says. ""Acting is very different from singing, and it took some time for me to adjust to being on a movie set. But I had an amazing support system with the cast and crew, and they helped me every step of the way.""

Chloe's co-stars in 'Praise This' include actor and singer Usher, who plays the school's music director, and Audra McDonald, who plays the principal. She says that working with them was a dream come true.

""They're both incredible performers, and I learned so much from them,"" she says. ""To be able to work alongside them was a blessing.""

Chloe hopes that audiences will enjoy the film and be inspired by its message.

""I hope that when people watch 'Praise This', they feel uplifted and motivated,"" she says. ""I hope it reminds them of the power of faith and the importance of teamwork, and that it inspires them to pursue their dreams no matter what.""

Chloe is also excited about what the future holds for her and her sister Halle.

""We're always working on new music and exploring new sounds,"" she says. ""We're excited to see where our music takes us, and we're open to exploring different genres and collaborating with different artists.""

Chloe says that being a part of 'Praise This' has been a blessing, and she is grateful for the experience.

""I feel like doing this movie was a reminder of why I'm here and what I'm meant to do,"" she says. ""It was a blessing to be a part of something that's not only entertaining but also meaningful.""",1
85,Colorado high school students return to class amid investigation into possible bacterial meningitis deaths of two teachers,"Colorado high school students returned to classes Monday after the weekend deaths of two teachers prompted a possible bacterial meningitis investigation that left parents and students on edge.

The Douglas County School District reported Saturday that the teachers, who taught at Sierra Middle School, had died the day before ""after a sudden onset illness."" Since then, the district has been working with health officials to determine the cause of their deaths.

School officials said Sunday that all students and staff members who had been in contact with the teachers had been notified and advised about symptoms to look for. Neither teacher had any known medical conditions that would explain their deaths, according to the school district.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The disease can be caused by a virus or bacteria and can be especially dangerous in crowded or close quarters, such as in a school.

According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, bacterial meningitis is spread through close contact with an infected person, such as sharing drinks or kissing. Symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and a stiff neck.

The department has urged anyone who attended a recent social event at Sierra Middle School to watch for symptoms.

""Although the cause of their deaths is still under investigation, bacterial meningitis has not been ruled out,"" the department said in a statement.

Meanwhile, grief counselors were on hand at the school Monday to help students and staff cope with the losses.

""It's just really sad,"" Sierra Middle School student Riley McDermott told CNN affiliate KCNC. ""It's hard for us to understand and get through this.""

Others expressed concern about the possible health risks.

""I'm really worried about it spreading,"" Sierra Middle School parent Darcy Richards told KCNC. ""I actually told my daughter's teacher that we're going to be very cautious and we're going to make sure she's not sharing anything with anybody, and we're going to be watching her carefully for symptoms.""

In an email to parents, the Douglas County School District said it had ""followed and exceeded"" guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the handling of the possible meningitis cases.

""We are taking this matter very seriously, and we are working together with our partners in the local and state health departments to ensure the health and safety of everyone in our school community,"" the district said.

The district said it has also cleaned and disinfected the school and will continue to do so on a regular basis.

The situation at Sierra Middle School comes amid a spike in bacterial meningitis cases across the country.

Last week, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln reported that a student had died of bacterial meningitis. The university said it was working with health officials to determine if any other students had been in contact with the victim.

In February, a University of Oregon student died from bacterial meningitis, prompting a campus-wide vaccination effort. Prior to that, an outbreak in Los Angeles killed three people and sickened dozens more.

Meningitis outbreaks on college campuses are not uncommon, as young adults are at increased risk of contracting the disease due to close living quarters and social behavior.

According to the CDC, college freshmen living in dormitories have a higher risk of getting meningitis than non-college freshmen.

The CDC recommends that all college students receive the meningococcal vaccine, which protects against four of the five strains of meningococcal disease.

The vaccine is also recommended for adolescents ages 11-12, with a booster dose given at age 16.

""We know that vaccination is a key way to protect against meningitis,"" said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's immunization program. ""We hope that this situation will remind parents and young adults about the importance of vaccination.""

The investigation into the deaths of the Sierra Middle School teachers is ongoing, and health officials said it may take several days to determine the cause.

Meanwhile, the school community is trying to come to grips with the loss.

""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of these two beloved teachers,"" the Douglas County School District said in a statement. ""We will miss them greatly, and they will always be remembered as valued members of our school community.""

As the investigation continues, health officials are urging anyone who may have been in contact with the teachers or attended a recent school event to watch for symptoms of meningitis and seek medical attention if they experience any.

The Douglas County School District has also set up a hotline for parents with questions or concerns about the situation.",1
86,An elephant living in a Berlin zoo learns how to peel a banana,"An elephant living in a Berlin zoo has caused a stir on social media this week after a video emerged of her peeling a banana with her trunk.

The video shows three-year-old elephant, Kibali, carefully removing the skin from a banana before eating it. The crowd of visitors surrounding her can be heard gasping in amazement as she expertly navigates the task.

For elephant enthusiasts, the video is a remarkable testament to the animal’s intelligence and adaptability. For others, it’s simply a cute and heartwarming moment.

But how impressive is Kibali’s feat really? And what does it tell us about elephants in general?

To answer these questions, we caught up with some experts in the field.

Dr. Joshua Plotnik, an elephant behavior expert and assistant professor at Hunter College, New York, told CNN that Kibali's feat wasn't as surprising as it may seem.

""Elephants are remarkable in their ability to learn and use different tools and techniques for getting at food,"" he said.

""Using their trunks to peel bananas is just one example of how they are able to adapt to novel situations and utilize the resources available to them.""

In the wild, elephants use their trunks for a variety of tasks, from plucking leaves off branches to drinking from water sources. They are also able to use their trunks to pick up objects, such as logs or rocks, and even to scratch themselves.

According to Dr. Plotnik, this level of adaptability and flexibility is one of the reasons elephants are so successful in their natural habitat.

""Elephants live in a wide range of habitats, from dense forests to grasslands to deserts, and they are able to thrive in each of these environments because they are able to adapt to the unique challenges of each one,"" he explained.

But while elephants are certainly adaptable, the fact that Kibali was able to learn to peel a banana in captivity is also noteworthy.

In the wild, elephants learn from their mothers and other members of their social group, but in a zoo environment, they are often deprived of these opportunities.

""Zoo animals don't have access to the same kind of social learning that they would in the wild,"" said Dr. Plotnik. ""So when they learn something like peeling a banana, it's often through trial and error rather than being taught by a more experienced individual.""

This means that Kibali's ability to peel a banana is not only an impressive display of adaptability, but also a reflection of the quality of care she is receiving in the zoo.

""Zookeepers are doing an amazing job of providing enrichment activities and opportunities for Kibali and other elephants,"" said Dr. Plotnik. ""This kind of stimulation and engagement is crucial for their overall well-being.""

Kibali is one of three elephants currently living at the Berlin Zoo. Her mother, Pang Pha, and another female, Kaveri, also reside there.

According to the zoo's website, the elephants have access to a 1.2-hectare outdoor enclosure, as well as a spacious indoor area.

In addition to the standard food and water provisions, the elephants are provided with daily enrichment activities, such as puzzle feeders, sensory boxes, and other toys.

These activities are designed to stimulate the elephants' natural instincts and encourage them to engage in behaviors they would exhibit in the wild.

But despite these efforts, some animal welfare advocates argue that zoos are not a suitable environment for elephants, or any wild animals for that matter.

Zoos have long been criticized for their treatment of animals, with many arguing that the enclosures are too small and the animals are deprived of their natural environments.

Animal welfare groups, such as PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), have called for all zoos to be phased out and replaced with more ethical alternatives, such as sanctuaries where animals can live out their lives in a more natural environment.

""Zoos are essentially prisons for animals, and no amount of enrichment activities can change that,"" said PETA spokesperson, Laura D'Amico, in a statement to CNN.

""Elephants, in particular, are social animals who need to live in large herds and roam over long distances. Keeping them in small enclosures is not only cruel, it's also detrimental to their health.""

While the debate over the ethics of zoos continues, it's clear that Kibali's ability to peel a banana has sparked a discussion about the intelligence and adaptability of elephants.

For Dr. Plotnik, the video is a reminder of the incredible complexity and diversity of animal behavior.

""Watching an elephant peel a banana may seem like a small thing, but it's actually a testament to the amazing diversity of behaviors that exists in the animal kingdom,"" he said.

""Animals are capable of so much more than we give them credit for, and as we learn more about them, I think we will begin to appreciate just how remarkable they really are.""",1
87,"Drake Bell, star of 'Drake & Josh,' is no longer 'considered missing and endangered'","Drake Bell, the popular actor and musician known for his roles in ""Drake & Josh"" and ""Ultimate Spider-Man,"" is going through a tumultuous period in his life. The beloved artist was recently declared ""missing and endangered"" by the authorities, sparking a widespread search effort among fans, friends and family. However, a new update has emerged, with Bell no longer listed as missing or endangered. Here's what we know about the situation so far.

The drama started on June 3, when the LAPD released a statement saying that Bell, whose real name is Jared Drake Bell, had been reported missing. According to the police, Bell had not been seen in almost a week, and friends and family were concerned about his welfare. The statement also mentioned that Bell's vehicle had been located, but did not provide additional information about his whereabouts or the circumstances surrounding his disappearance.

The news sent shockwaves among Drake Bell fans worldwide, who took to social media to express their worry and support for the actor. The hashtag #FindDrakeBell quickly started trending on Twitter, with many people sharing images, videos and messages in hopes of locating their beloved idol. The situation was particularly concerning given that Bell had recently been involved in several high-profile legal controversies, including a child endangerment case and a DUI arrest.

However, on June 4, the tides started to turn. The LAPD released another statement, this time informing the public that Bell was no longer considered missing or endangered. The authorities did not provide any further details about the situation and did not disclose the reason why Bell had been removed from the list. Nevertheless, fans and supporters breathed a sigh of relief and shared their joy on social media.

Since then, there has been little information about what exactly happened to Drake Bell during the week he was reported missing. Some fans have speculated that the situation might have been a publicity stunt or a hoax, but there's no hard evidence to support these claims. Meanwhile, others have raised concerns about Bell's mental health and well-being, given his recent legal troubles and the nature of the entertainment industry.

What is clear is that the situation has further highlighted the intense pressure and scrutiny that celebrities face in today's society. The rise of social media has made it easier than ever for fans to follow and interact with their favorite stars, but it has also blurred the line between public and private life. Celebrities are expected to maintain a certain image and persona, often at the expense of their own mental health and autonomy.

Moreover, the legal system can be unforgiving towards celebrities, who often face harsher penalties and more public shame than regular citizens. Drake Bell's recent legal controversies, including pleading guilty to child endangerment charges and serving probation, have damaged his reputation and career prospects, even as his fans continue to support him.

It's worth noting, however, that not all celebrities face the same level of public scrutiny and legal troubles. There are many successful and respected artists who manage to maintain a relatively low profile and stay out of trouble. It's also important to recognize that celebrities are not invincible or immune to mental health problems and addiction, and that their struggles are no less valid or deserving of help than anyone else's.

As for Drake Bell, his future remains uncertain. He has not released a statement about the incident or the reasons behind his disappearance. His social media accounts have been relatively quiet, with only a few posts about his music and touring commitments. It's unclear whether he will continue to act in the future or if he plans to focus on his music career instead.

Drake Bell is still remembered and loved by many fans for his charismatic personality and infectious energy on ""Drake & Josh,"" a beloved Nickelodeon sitcom that ran from 2004 to 2007. The show was a hit among young audiences for its slapstick humor, relatable characters and heartwarming moments. Bell played the titular character, a teenager who shares a stepbrother with whom he has a love-hate relationship.

After ""Drake & Josh,"" Bell continued to act in a variety of TV shows and movies, including ""The Amanda Show,"" ""Family Guy,"" and ""The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps."" He also ventured into music, releasing several albums and singles under his own name. He has been praised for his versatility and talent as a performer, but also criticized for his controversial opinions and behavior in social media and public appearances.

The incident of Bell's disappearance and subsequent update has been a rollercoaster of emotions for his fans and the public. It has raised questions about celebrity fame, mental health and the role of the media in shaping public opinion. However, it also serves as a reminder that celebrities are human beings who deserve empathy and respect, even in the face of controversy or scandal.",1
88,'We're way ahead of our skis here': Hear expert's warning about AI,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been touted as the future of technology, with experts predicting that it will revolutionize numerous aspects of our daily lives. However, a leading AI expert has issued a warning that we may be getting too far ahead of ourselves.

In an interview with CNN, Dr. Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google Brain and former Vice President of Baidu, said, ""We're way ahead of our skis here when it comes to AI. We need to be cautious about the impact it can have on society.""

Dr. Ng cited several potential concerns, such as the displacement of jobs and the potential for AI to be used for unethical purposes. He also mentioned the issue of bias in AI systems, which can perpetuate discrimination against certain groups.

Despite these concerns, Dr. Ng emphasized the importance of continuing to develop and research AI technologies. He noted that AI has the potential to bring about positive changes in areas such as healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability.

However, he stressed the need for responsible and ethical development, and called for industry leaders to prioritize the development of AI systems that are transparent, fair, and accountable.

""We don't want to create a future where AI is used as a tool of oppression,"" said Dr. Ng. ""We need to work hard to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits everyone in society.""",1
89,Bodycam footage shows police's quick response to bank gunman,"Bodycam footage has been released showing the quick response of police officers to a gunman who entered a bank in downtown on Monday. The footage, which was captured on body-worn cameras, shows the tense moments as officers entered the bank and apprehended the suspect.

According to police, they received a call about an armed robbery in progress at the bank at around 10:30 am. Within minutes, officers arrived at the scene and entered the bank.

In the footage, officers can be seen cautiously entering the bank with their weapons drawn. As they move through the bank, they spot the suspect and order him to drop his weapon. The suspect, who was later identified as a 32-year-old man, complies and is quickly taken into custody.

Speaking to CNN, Police Chief John Smith praised the quick response of his officers. ""Our officers did an outstanding job under incredibly difficult circumstances,"" he said. ""Their quick actions undoubtedly saved lives.""

The suspect is currently being held in custody and is expected to face a number of charges, including armed robbery and possession of a weapon. No injuries were reported during the incident.

The release of the bodycam footage comes as police across the country face increased scrutiny over their use of force. However, Chief Smith said the footage shows his officers using ""appropriate force"" to apprehend the suspect.",1
90,5 easy steps to get healthier,"Introduction:
In today's fast-paced life, people are becoming more and more health conscious. With busy schedules and hectic lifestyles, it can be difficult to maintain a healthy lifestyle. But, the good news is that becoming healthier doesn't have to be complicated! In this article, we will discuss five easy steps you can take to get healthier.

Step 1: Start with your diet
One of the easiest ways to improve your health is by starting with your diet. Make sure you eat a balanced diet that contains all the essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, fiber, and healthy fats. Avoid fast foods, processed foods, and sugary drinks, which can negatively affect your health.

The best way to start improving your diet is to add more fruits and vegetables to your meals. Try to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. You can also incorporate more whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your diet. This could mean enjoying a piece of grilled chicken with quinoa and roasted vegetables or a salad with healthy fats like avocado.

Step 2: Stay active
Physical activity is important for maintaining good health. Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight, improve your cardiovascular health, and reduce your risk of chronic diseases. It doesn't have to be hard—you can start with simple activities like walking, jogging or cycling. The key is to find an activity that you enjoy doing and make it a part of your routine.

A good goal is to aim for 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. You don't necessarily have to go to the gym to get a good workout in. You can also take up hiking, yoga or Pilates classes, or even dancing. Try to engage in physical activity at least three times a week.

Step 3: Get enough sleep
A good night's sleep is essential for good health. In fact, sleep can have just as much of an impact on your health as exercise and diet. Sleep helps your body recover from the day's stresses, boost your immune system, and improve your mental health.

Adults should aim to get between seven to nine hours of sleep each night. If you're having trouble getting enough sleep, try to establish a consistent sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, and create a comfortable sleep environment. Getting enough exercise during the day can also help promote better sleep at night.

Step 4: Manage stress
Stress can take a toll on your mental and physical health. Chronic stress has been linked to a range of health problems, including depression, anxiety, and heart disease. To manage your stress, try to identify the things that trigger your stress levels and find healthy ways to cope.

Meditation, yoga, tai chi, and deep breathing exercises are all great ways to reduce stress. You can also try to prioritize self-care, such as taking a relaxing bath, spending time outdoors, or reading a book. It's also essential to establish healthy boundaries and practice good time management to reduce stress.

Step 5: Stay hydrated
Drinking enough water is essential for good health. Water helps your body maintain fluid balance, regulate your body temperature, and flush toxins out of your body. It can also improve your energy levels and cognitive functions.

Aim to drink at least eight glasses of water each day. You can also increase your water intake by consuming foods with high water content, such as cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon. Avoid sugary drinks, sports drinks, and alcohol which can dehydrate you.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while becoming healthier can seem daunting, it doesn't have to be. By following these five simple steps, you can improve your diet, become more active, get enough sleep, manage stress, and stay hydrated. Remember, a healthy lifestyle is a journey, not a destination. So, start by making small changes to your routine and gradually build up to a healthier lifestyle.",1
91,California bill aims to ban sale of popular candies containing ingredients that may cause health issues,"California lawmakers have proposed a new bill that could ban the sale of popular candies containing ingredients that may cause health issues. The proposed bill, which is yet to be approved, would prohibit the sale of candies containing high levels of sugar, caffeine, and artificial colors that may contribute to obesity, diabetes, and ADHD in children.

The proposed bill, known as the California Candy Ban, is being hailed as a significant step towards promoting healthier eating habits among children. It seeks to ban the sale of candy products that contain more than 250 calories per serving, more than 25 grams of added sugar per serving, and caffeine or any artificial colors. The bill would affect popular candies such as M&Ms, Skittles, Sour Patch Kids, and Twizzlers, among others.

The bill's proponents argue that candy products targeted towards children tend to be high in sugar and caffeine, which can cause long-term health issues. Studies have shown that excess sugar consumption can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. Additionally, caffeine can cause hyperactivity and attention deficits, which can be detrimental to children's mental and physical development.

While candy makers have not responded publicly to the proposed ban, industry experts have criticized it, saying that the government should not dictate what consumers can or cannot eat.

Critics of the proposed bill argue that California lawmakers are overreaching their bounds and ignoring market forces. They say that parents should be the ones deciding what their children eat, not the government.

Despite the opposition, supporters of the proposed bill insist that it is necessary to protect children's health in a society that is increasingly unhealthy. They argue that the bill will encourage candy makers to produce healthier snacks for children, thereby promoting a culture of healthy eating in California.

State Senator Bill Monning, who introduced the bill, said that ""the consumption of sugary, caffeinated candy among children is a growing public health problem that must be addressed. This bill seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of excessive sugar and caffeine consumption and promote healthier eating habits.""

If the California Candy Ban is approved, it will be the first time that a state has attempted to ban the sale of candies containing a specific set of ingredients. While other states have proposed similar bans, none have been successful.

The proposed bill has already generated a lot of buzz on social media, with many parents expressing their support for the ban. However, some critics have expressed their concerns over the potential impact on the candy industry and its employees, as well as the infringement of individual freedoms.

The candy industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and is a significant employer in California, where many of the leading candy manufacturers are based. Some industry experts argue that the proposed bill will lead to job losses and a decline in the industry's profitability.

Furthermore, some critics argue that the proposed ban is an infringement on individual freedoms, and the government should not be dictating what consumers can or cannot eat. Some argue that there are already regulations in place to ensure that candy makers are transparent about their ingredients, and consumers should have the right to make their own choices.

Despite the opposition, supporters of the ban argue that the government has a responsibility to promote public health and safety, especially when children are involved. They say that the proposed ban will encourage candy makers to produce healthier snacks for children, thereby promoting a culture of healthy eating in California.

In recent years, there has been a growing concern over the impact of sugar and caffeine consumption on children's health. Studies have shown that excessive sugar consumption can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. Additionally, caffeine can cause hyperactivity and attention deficits, which can be detrimental to children's mental and physical development.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children should consume no more than six teaspoons of added sugar per day. However, studies have shown that many children consume far more than this amount, primarily through sweetened drinks and candy products.

The proposed bill has been met with varying degrees of support across the state, with some lawmakers advocating for a more comprehensive approach to addressing childhood obesity and diabetes. Other lawmakers argue that the proposed ban is a necessary first step towards promoting healthier eating habits among children.

As the debate over the proposed bill continues, it is clear that the issue of childhood obesity and diabetes is a significant public health concern that must be addressed. While the proposed ban may not be the ultimate solution, it is a step in the right direction towards promoting healthier eating habits among children in California. It remains to be seen whether the bill will be approved, and if so, what its impact will be on the candy industry and the residents of California. 

In conclusion, the proposed California Candy Ban is a significant step towards promoting healthier eating habits among children. While it has generated opposition from some critics, its supporters argue that it is a necessary measure to protect children's health in a society that is increasingly unhealthy. As the debate over the proposed bill continues, it is up to lawmakers to balance public health concerns with individual freedoms and the impact on the candy industry. Ultimately, what is at stake is the health of future generations, and we must all work together to ensure that children have access to healthy foods and snacks that promote their well-being.",1
92,"April 12, 2023 Second ousted lawmaker headed back to Tennessee House","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (CNN) - Tennessee's tumultuous political landscape added another chapter on Tuesday as a former state representative who was ousted from the House in 2021 was elected to the same body.

Scott DesJarlais, a Republican from South Pittsburg, will represent House District 28 after winning a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Billy Long.

DesJarlais had previously represented the district for six terms before being defeated by fellow Republican Congressman John Rose in the 2020 primary.

He had faced a series of controversies during his time in office, including reports of extramarital affairs, allegations of medical misconduct, and questions over his use of campaign funds.

Despite these issues, DesJarlais was able to mount a successful campaign, promising to return to the House and fight for conservative values.

""I'm thrilled to be back in the House and representing the people of District 28,"" he said in a statement.

""I'm committed to working tirelessly in support of our conservative principles, and I'm honored to have the chance to serve once again.""

DesJarlais' victory comes just days after Mark Pody, another former representative who was removed from office in 2021, won a special election to fill a Senate seat in the same district.

Pody, a Republican from Lebanon, had been expelled from the House after pleading guilty to a charge of driving under the influence.

His victory in the Senate race means that he will be returning to the General Assembly just one year after being forced out.

The two elections highlight the volatile nature of Tennessee politics, which has seen a number of high-profile scandals in recent years.

Former Governor Bill Haslam was dogged by allegations of corruption, while former state Rep. Jeremy Durham was expelled from the House in 2016 over sexual harassment allegations.

Despite these issues, Tennessee remains a deeply conservative state, with Republicans holding majorities in both the House and Senate.

DesJarlais' victory was celebrated by many of his supporters, who view him as a champion of conservative values.

""I'm so happy to see Scott back in the House,"" said Nathan Smith, a voter from Grundy County.

""He's always been a strong voice for our community and I know he'll fight hard for us in Nashville.""

But many critics expressed concern over the return of DesJarlais, citing his troubled past and history of controversial statements.

During his previous tenure in the House, DesJarlais had faced intense scrutiny over reports of extramarital affairs with staffers and patients while he was working as a physician.

He was also criticized for making insensitive remarks about slavery and rape, and faced allegations of medical misconduct related to the abortions he performed on his patients.

""I'm disappointed that Scott DesJarlais was able to win this race,"" said Christine Young, a voter from Sewanee.

""He has a long history of unethical behavior and I don't think he should be serving in elected office at all.""

Despite the criticism, DesJarlais has vowed to govern in a responsible manner and work to improve the lives of his constituents.

""I understand that I've made mistakes in the past, but I've learned from them and I'm committed to doing better,"" he said.

""I'm going to be a strong advocate for the people of District 28, and I'm going to work tirelessly to make sure their voices are heard in Nashville.""

DesJarlais will be sworn in to the House later this month, joining a legislature that has already been rocked by controversy and scandal.

But despite the challenges facing the state, many voters expressed optimism that their representatives would be able to rise above the political fray and work for the common good.

""I think Tennessee has some great leaders who are committed to making our state a better place,"" said Marcy Mitchell, a voter from Franklin.

""We've been through a lot in recent years, but I believe we'll emerge stronger and more united than ever before.""",1
93,"Memphis leaders pass measure that ends police stops for minor infractions, three months after Tyre Nichols' death","Memphis leaders have passed a historic measure that will put an end to police stops for minor infractions, just three months after the death of Tyre Nichols, a black man who was allegedly killed in police custody after being pulled over for a minor traffic violation.

The measure, which passed on a unanimous vote by the Memphis City Council, represents a significant step forward in the ongoing fight for racial justice and police reform in the United States. The legislation prohibits law enforcement from stopping drivers solely for minor offenses such as broken tail lights, expired registrations or missing license plates.

It also requires officers to issue civil citations rather than arrest individuals for non-violent misdemeanors. The measure also enhances police training on implicit bias and racial profiling.

Tyre Nichols' death, which occurred in February 2021, is widely regarded as a catalyst for the reform legislation. The 23-year-old black man was pulled over by Memphis police officers for allegedly driving with a suspended license. He was later found dead in his cell at the Memphis City Jail, prompting outrage and calls for change.

Family members of Nichols worked tirelessly with activists and city leaders to push for reform in Memphis. The passing of the legislation represents a significant victory for those seeking justice for Nichols and other victims of police brutality and racial injustice.

""Today is a day of hope for all those who have lost loved ones at the hands of law enforcement,"" said Reverend Al Sharpton, who has been instrumental in advocating for police reform across the country. ""This measure is a critical step forward in ensuring that communities of color can live free from the fear and threat of discriminatory policing.""

The legislation drew widespread support from civil rights organizations, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the ACLU, both of which had strongly advocated for the measure.

""This is a historic moment for Memphis and the nation as a whole,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, President and Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ""The city of Memphis has shown that it is committed to ending police brutality and taking steps to address the root causes of racial injustice. We hope that other cities across the country will follow in their footsteps.""

Memphis joins a growing list of cities across the country that have implemented similar measures aimed at curbing discriminatory police practices. Earlier this year, Oakland, California became the first city in the country to pass a law prohibiting police from stopping drivers for minor infractions.

Critics of the Memphis measure argue that it could hinder police officers' ability to effectively enforce the law and keep communities safe. Some have also raised concerns that the legislation could lead to an increase in crime and traffic accidents.

However, supporters of the measure maintain that it will ultimately benefit all members of the community, including law enforcement officers. By reducing the number of unnecessary stops and arrests, the legislation will free up police resources and improve community relations.

“The passing of this legislation is a major step forward in addressing systemic racism in our criminal justice system,"" said William J. Barber II, Co-Chair of the Poor People’s Campaign. ""By ending the practice of indiscriminately stopping and arresting black and brown people for minor traffic violations, we can begin to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities of color.""

Indeed, the issue of trust between police and communities of color has been a major concern in cities across the country. The killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota last year, sparked nationwide protests and demands for police reform.

While there have been some changes at the federal level in response to the movement for racial justice, including the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, progress has been slow and uneven across the country.

As cities like Memphis take steps towards meaningful police reform, many activists and civil rights leaders are calling for similar measures to be implemented nationwide.

""The passing of this legislation in Memphis represents a major victory for communities of color across the country,"" said Ifill. ""We urge other cities and states to follow in their footsteps and take concrete steps towards ending discriminatory policing once and for all.""",1
94,The future of travel,"As the world gradually emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, the future of travel has become one of the most widely discussed topics in the tourism industry. While many countries are still grappling with the effects of the pandemic, some experts are optimistic that better times will come.

One of the most notable changes likely to happen is the adoption of digital technology in travel. From virtual tours to online bookings and contactless payments, technology is set to revolutionize the travel industry. This will not only make travel more convenient but also reduce physical interactions in line with the principles of social distancing.

Another trend that is likely to emerge is the promotion of sustainable travel. The pandemic has made many people realize the importance of preserving our environment, and eco-friendly travel options are set to become even more popular.

Despite the uncertainty that surrounds the travel industry, one thing that is certain is that the future of travel is likely to be different from what it was before the pandemic, and it will continue to evolve in new and exciting ways.",1
95,'Yellowstone' on-screen couple confirms real-life romance,"""Yellowstone"" on-screen couple confirms real-life romance

""Yellowstone"" viewers have been eagerly watching the chemistry between Kevin Costner's character, John Dutton, and Kelly Reilly's character, Beth Dutton, as they navigate the ups and downs of running their Montana ranch. But it turns out the chemistry might have been more than just acting.

Costner and Reilly have confirmed that they are indeed in a romantic relationship off-screen.

Rumors of the relationship first started swirling when the two were spotted spending time together outside of filming. However, the two remained tight-lipped when asked about their relationship status.

That is until now. In a recent interview with People Magazine, Costner finally opened up about his relationship with Reilly.

""I have to say that Kelly and I have been really good friends for a long time,"" Costner said. ""But we didn't start dating until after we started filming the show. It just sort of happened.""

Reilly echoed Costner's sentiments, saying that their relationship grew organically over time.

""We have a lot in common and a deep connection that just seemed to develop over time,"" Reilly said. ""We both have a love for the outdoors and those Montana skies just seem to bring out the best in both of us.""

The news has certainly sparked excitement from ""Yellowstone"" fans, who have long been rooting for the two characters to get together on the show. And now, seeing the two actors together in real life has only added to their excitement.

But the news has also sparked some controversy, with some fans questioning the ethics of two co-stars dating while working on a show together.

However, Hollywood relationships are nothing new. In fact, many celebrity couples met and fell in love while working together. And, as Costner pointed out, their relationship did not start until after they began filming the show, so it did not affect their performances or the show's production.

""At the end of the day, Kelly and I are professionals,"" Costner said. ""Our job is to make the show as amazing as possible, and our personal lives don't interfere with that.""

Reilly also emphasized the importance of keeping their personal lives separate from their work.

""We both understand that our relationship is private and that our job is to bring these two characters to life on screen,"" Reilly said. ""We are committed to keeping our personal lives separate from our work.""

So, what does the future hold for Costner and Reilly's relationship? Well, for now, they are taking things one step at a time.

""We are both really happy where we are right now,"" Costner said. ""We're just enjoying each other's company and taking things as they come.""

And as for the future of ""Yellowstone,"" fans can rest assured that the show will continue to deliver the drama and romance that they have come to love.

""We are all committed to making 'Yellowstone' the best show it can be,"" Reilly said. ""And that means bringing these characters to life in the most authentic way possible.""

With the news of Costner and Reilly's real-life romance, it's safe to say that the chemistry between John and Beth Dutton will only continue to sizzle on screen.

And for ""Yellowstone"" fans, that's all they could ask for.",1
96,Shark bite leaves surfer in Hawaii in serious condition,"Hawaii has always been a paradise for surfers, with its crystal clear blue waters and endless waves. However, it can also be a dangerous place, with sharks being a constant threat in the ocean. Sadly, this was the case for a surfer who was attacked by a shark off the coast of Maui on Wednesday, leaving him in serious condition.

The surfer, who has been identified as 31-year-old John Doe, was surfing at a popular spot known as Honolua Bay when the incident occurred. Eyewitnesses reported that Doe was waiting for a wave when a shark suddenly appeared and bit him on the leg.

""He was just sitting on his board waiting for a wave when the shark came out of nowhere and attacked him,"" said one witness who did not wish to be named. ""It was like something out of a nightmare, and we all just froze. We couldn't believe what was happening.""

Doe was rushed ashore by fellow surfers, who immediately began administering first aid. Emergency services were then called, and Doe was airlifted to the hospital where he remains in serious condition.

The incident has sent shockwaves through the surfing community in Hawaii, a place where shark attacks are not uncommon. In fact, Hawaii has one of the highest rates of shark attacks in the world, with an average of four per year. While fatalities are rare, attacks can be severe and even life-threatening.

According to experts, there are several reasons why Hawaii is such a hot spot for shark attacks. First and foremost, the warm waters surrounding the islands are home to a variety of shark species, including the notorious tiger shark, which is responsible for the majority of attacks in the region. Secondly, the geography of the islands means that surfers are often paddling close to deep water, where sharks can lurk unseen.

Despite the risks, surfing remains a hugely popular pastime in Hawaii, and the authorities do their best to manage the dangers. Beaches are often closed when sharks are spotted, and surfers are encouraged to attend shark awareness classes. However, surfers are also advised to take personal responsibility for their safety by following basic rules, such as avoiding surfing alone, staying away from areas where there are signs of shark activity, and wearing protective gear.

The incident at Honolua Bay has reignited the debate about what more can be done to prevent shark attacks in Hawaii. Some experts have called for stricter measures, such as culling sharks or installing shark nets around popular surf spots. However, others argue that such measures are ineffective and can actually make matters worse.

""Sharks are a vital part of the ecosystem here in Hawaii, and we cannot simply go around killing them because they pose a risk to humans,"" said marine biologist Dr. Jane Smith. ""Instead, we need to find ways to coexist with them in a way that minimizes the risk to ourselves and respects their role in the ecosystem.""

Despite the risks, many surfers in Hawaii remain undeterred, and the sport will continue to be a popular pastime for years to come. However, as this latest incident shows, it is important for surfers to be aware of the risks and take the necessary precautions to stay safe.

Our thoughts and prayers are with John Doe and his family during this difficult time, and we hope he makes a full and speedy recovery. In the meantime, let us all take a moment to reflect on the fragile balance between humans and nature, and how we can work together to achieve a safer, more harmonious future.",1
97,California's snowy winter offers hope for drought relief,"The snowy winter in California has brought some much-needed relief to the state’s ongoing drought. This winter season has seen record snowfall levels in the Sierra Nevada mountains, which provide crucial meltwater to the state’s rivers and reservoirs.

According to the California Department of Water Resources, the statewide snowpack is over 130 percent of average levels. This bodes well for the state’s reservoirs, which had been depleted due to years of drought. The Sierra snowpack alone provides about 30 percent of the state’s water supply.

The snowfall has also helped replenish groundwater reserves, which have been significantly depleted by drought conditions in recent years. Groundwater provides approximately 40 percent of California’s water supply.

While the state’s water supply may not fully recover from the drought after just one snowy winter, these recent snowfall levels give hope to the ongoing drought relief efforts.

Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency due to the drought, and many municipalities have imposed water restrictions. However, with the recent snowfall, there may be less of a demand for strict conservation measures.

Experts caution that even with these positive developments, the state must work towards long-term solutions to manage its water supply, including better management of groundwater reserves and investment in water-efficient technologies. But for now, the snowy winter provides a glimmer of hope for a state that has long been struggling to overcome its water crisis.",1
98,Clinics and doctors brace for more restrictions on women's health care after court ruling on abortion drug,"Clinics and Doctors Brace for More Restrictions on Women's Health Care After Court Ruling on Abortion Drug

The recent Supreme Court ruling on the abortion drug mifepristone has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community, leaving clinics and doctors bracing for the impact of the court's decision. Many fear that this ruling will set a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on women's access to safe and legal abortion care.

The case in question, FDA v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, centered on whether the FDA's requirements for prescribing mifepristone during the COVID-19 pandemic were necessary or if they unnecessarily burdened patients seeking medication abortion care. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the FDA, allowing the agency to continue to enforce its restrictions on the drug.

Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication used to terminate early pregnancies up to 10 weeks gestation. It is commonly prescribed in a two-pill regimen, with the first pill administered at the clinic and the second pill taken at home. The drug was approved by the FDA in 2000 and has been safely used by millions of people worldwide to end their pregnancies.

However, despite its safety and efficacy, mifepristone has long been a target of anti-abortion lawmakers and activists. In recent years, states have passed laws that require the drug to be prescribed according to outdated and unnecessary FDA-recommended protocols, including in-person dispensing and administration of the medication, which can lead to delays and added costs for patients.

The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these restrictions, as many clinics were forced to limit their in-person services to reduce the risk of virus transmission. In response, medical groups and advocates urged the FDA to temporarily lift its onerous requirements for mifepristone, citing the drug's safety and the urgent need for expanded access to medication abortion during the pandemic.

Despite these pleas, the FDA refused to budge, prompting the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other medical groups to sue the agency in an effort to protect patients' access to mifepristone. While lower courts sided with the medical groups and temporarily lifted the FDA's restrictions, the Supreme Court's ruling has undone these gains and allowed the agency to continue enforcing its outdated and burdensome requirements for the drug.

This decision has dire implications for women's health care, particularly in areas where access to abortion services is already limited. Clinics and providers are now faced with the prospect of navigating a confusing patchwork of state and federal regulations that restrict mifepristone and other abortion medications, potentially putting patients' health and safety at risk.

""It's really frustrating and disheartening to see people's access to safe and effective abortion care being further restricted, especially during a pandemic,"" said Stephanie Fowler, the CEO of the Abortion Care Network, an organization that supports independent abortion providers across the United States.

Fowler added, ""We know that medication abortion is extremely safe and effective, and the FDA's rules are not based on medical evidence, but rather political interference. We really need lawmakers and regulators to start listening to medical experts and prioritizing patients' health and well-being over politics and ideology.""

The Supreme Court's decision is also worrying because it sets a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on abortion care, according to legal experts. The ruling effectively gives federal agencies like the FDA broad authority to impose unnecessary and burdensome regulations on abortion medications, even if those regulations pose a risk to patients' health.

""The Court's decision defers almost entirely to the FDA's view of mifepristone, despite the agency's lack of expertise in the field of abortion care,"" said Julia Kaye, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. ""The result is a dangerous expansion of government power to restrict medication abortion and limit access to care, with potentially devastating consequences for people across the country.""

Advocates for women's health care are now hoping that the incoming Biden administration will take action to reverse the FDA's restrictions on mifepristone and other abortion medications. Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, has pledged to protect and expand access to reproductive health care, including abortion services.

""We have a new administration coming in that's made some really positive statements about access to abortion, and I'm hopeful that they will take steps to roll back these regulations,"" said Fowler. ""But we're certainly not out of the woods yet – there's still a lot of work to do to ensure that everyone who needs an abortion can get one, and that politicians and lawmakers stop interfering with people's healthcare decisions.""

The fight for women's health care is far from over, but advocates and providers are determined to continue the fight for safe and accessible abortion care, regardless of the challenges ahead. As Fowler put it, ""We're not going to give up on our patients or on the fight for reproductive justice. We will keep pushing until every person has the right to make their own decisions about their body and their health.""",1
99,'Beef' turns a road-rage run-in into one of the year's juiciest shows,"As the pandemic continues to affect the world, people are finding new and unconventional ways to entertain themselves. One such case caught our attention, as an altercation between two drivers turned into a highly entertaining spectacle, all thanks to a simple word: ""beef."" 

It all started when two drivers, identified as John and Dave, had a minor accident on a busy street in a small town in Indiana. As they got out of their cars to assess the damage, voices rose, and tempers quickly flared. It was a classic case of road rage, but what happened next was far from ordinary. 

John, a beef farmer, noticed the ""Impossible Burger"" bumper sticker on Dave's car, and he couldn't resist making a comment about it. ""Hey, you vegetarian,"" he scoffed. ""Why don't you eat a real burger for once?"" 

The comment seemed harmless enough, but Dave didn't take kindly to it. ""I don't eat meat, and that's my choice,"" he retorted. ""You should respect that."" 

But John wasn't about to back down. ""Respect? You're the one disrespecting cows by not eating them,"" he shot back. ""You're missing out on the juiciest and most delicious food on the planet. What's wrong with you?"" 

And just like that, the two drivers had found themselves embroiled in an argument about the merits of meat-eating versus vegetarianism. It was a debate that had been done to death, but there was something about the passion with which John and Dave argued that caught the attention of passersby. Before long, a small crowd had gathered around the two men, curious to see how the beef vs. veggie showdown would play out. 

As it turned out, the showdown had only just begun. John, clearly fired up by the unexpected audience, launched into a passionate defense of beef. ""Beef is the backbone of America,"" he proclaimed. ""We're a nation built on steak and burgers. How can anyone not appreciate that?"" 

Dave was quick to counter. ""It's not about not appreciating it,"" he argued. ""I just don't believe in killing animals for food. It's cruel and unnecessary."" 

John scoffed. ""Cruel? We raise our cows humanely and with love. They have a purpose in life, and that's to feed us. It's a natural way of things."" 

And so it went, back and forth, for the better part of an hour. John extolling the virtues of beef, Dave championing the benefits of a meat-free diet. The crowd fluctuated in size, with some people coming and going, while others stayed put, cheering on their preferred side. 

As the argument began to wind down, it seemed as though John had won. His passionate defense of beef had swayed some of the previously neutral onlookers, and he had managed to get in the final word. ""At the end of the day, meat is just better,"" he said, with a satisfied smile. 

But then came the twist. Dave, sensing defeat, played his trump card. ""You want to talk about beef?"" he said, a sly smile creeping onto his face. ""Let's talk about the environmental impact of beef production."" 

Suddenly, the mood shifted. The passersby, who had been content to cheer and jeer, began to listen more closely. Dave launched into a detailed explanation of how beef production was a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution. John tried to counter with arguments about sustainable farming and responsible land management, but he could see that the crowd was no longer with him. 

And then Dave dropped the bombshell. ""I didn't want to bring this up, but I think it's important. Do you know how much water it takes to produce a single pound of beef?"" 

John looked stunned. ""No, how much?"" 

""Two thousand gallons,"" Dave said, triumphantly. ""Two thousand gallons of water just for one pound of beef. Think about that."" 

The crowd erupted into murmurs of shock and disbelief. John looked crestfallen. He had never considered that his beloved cows could be having such a negative impact on the planet. For a moment, it seemed as though the argument had ended in a draw. 

But then, in a brilliant move, John rallied. ""You know what? You're right,"" he said, nodding earnestly. ""Beef production does have an impact on the environment. And you know what else? We need to start talking more about how to make it sustainable. We need to work together to make beef production better for the planet."" 

The crowd erupted into cheers, and Dave looked momentarily taken aback. But then he too joined in. ""You're right,"" he said, his smile growing wider. ""We need to find solutions together. That's how we make progress."" 

And just like that, the argument was over. But the effects of it lingered on. The onlookers who had watched the spectacle unfold couldn't stop talking about it, and the story quickly spread beyond the small town. Before long, news outlets were picking up on ""the Beef Debate,"" and John and Dave became local celebrities. They even appeared on a segment of a popular daytime talk show, where they continued their argument, albeit in a more civilized manner. 

As the months went by, the Beef Debate became a cultural touchstone. People began using it as shorthand for any heated argument about food or the environment, and it became a popular Halloween costume. John and Dave both got book deals, and their faces appeared on t-shirts and coffee mugs. 

But the effect that the Beef Debate had on the two men was perhaps the most surprising of all. John, who had always been somewhat apathetic about environmental issues, began researching ways to make his farm more sustainable. He invested in new technology that helped reduce water usage and carbon emissions, and he even began experimenting with alternative feed sources for his cows. Dave, for his part, became more open-minded about his dietary choices, experimenting with vegan cooking and seeking out plant-based alternatives to his favorite foods. 

In the end, it was an unlikely encounter that had profound effects on two people, and also served as a reminder that sometimes the most unexpected things can lead to important conversations. And all it took was one word: ""beef.""",1
100,Prince Harry to go to King Charles III's upcoming coronation without Meghan,"Prince Harry is set to attend King Charles III's upcoming coronation without his wife Meghan Markle, according to sources close to the royal family. This news comes after several weeks of speculation about whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be in attendance.

Reports suggest that Meghan will stay in the United States with their two young children, Archie and Lilibet, due to concerns about the ongoing pandemic and travel restrictions. This will be Prince Harry's first major public event since his departure from royal duties last year.

The coronation of King Charles III is a historic moment for the British monarchy, and the absence of Meghan has only added fuel to the already burning rumors of a rift between the couple and the rest of the royal family.

102,Killed BLM protester's family reacts to Texas governor's plans to pardon man responsible,"The family of a Black Lives Matter (BLM) protester who was killed in Austin, Texas, has expressed shock and disappointment following the announcement by Texas Governor Greg Abbott that he plans to pardon the man responsible for their loved one's death.

Garrett Foster was shot and killed during a protest in downtown Austin on July 25, 2020, while he was reportedly pushing his disabled fiancee's wheelchair. The shooter, Daniel Perry, was an active-duty sergeant in the US Army at the time of the incident. Perry has claimed that he acted in self-defense, stating that he believed Foster was reaching for his weapon.

The Austin Police Department is still conducting an investigation into the shooting, but Governor Abbott has already made his intentions clear. In a statement released on Saturday, he said: ""I have instructed my staff to begin the process of issuing a pardon to Mr. Perry. It is clear that his actions were taken in self-defense and should not be punished.""

Foster's family disagrees with the governor's assertion that Perry acted in self-defense. In a statement released to the media, they said: ""Garrett was innocent, and he was murdered for exercising his First Amendment rights. Daniel Perry took away a son, a fiancé, a brother, a nephew, and a friend. We are devastated and outraged that Governor Abbott would consider pardoning him.""

The family's statement also expressed support for the ongoing protests against systemic racism and police brutality. ""Garrett was a peaceful protester who believed in justice and equality for all,"" they said. ""We stand behind the Black Lives Matter movement and will continue to demand accountability for those who perpetrate violence against peaceful demonstrators.""

The decision by Governor Abbott to pardon Daniel Perry has sparked outrage among BLM supporters and civil rights advocates across the country. Many are urging him to reconsider, arguing that his actions will only serve to undermine the fight for justice and equality.",1

104,Main Street investors bet on comeback for regional banks,"As the pandemic continues to ravage the U.S. economy, Main Street investors are starting to bet on a comeback for regional banks. While Wall Street has been laser-focused on the big banks and their ability to weather the storm, smaller and mid-sized regional banks have flown under the radar. But some investors are now seeing these institutions as an attractive opportunity to capitalize on an eventual economic recovery.

For years, regional banks have struggled to keep up with the larger, well-capitalized banks that operate in major financial centers, such as New York and San Francisco. These big banks have the resources to invest in new technologies, hire top talent and expand their already massive footprints. But regional banks have a unique advantage in that they are often deeply ingrained in their communities and can offer more personalized services to their customers.

Now, in the midst of a pandemic, these community connections could prove to be regional banks’ saving grace. While big banks have been inundated with applications for government-backed loans due to the COVID-19 crisis, regional banks have been able to step up and provide critical assistance to small businesses in their local areas.

For example, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares recently announced that it had provided nearly 19,000 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, totaling $2.6 billion in funding. This puts the bank in the same league as much larger institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, when it comes to supporting small businesses.

Similarly, First Horizon National Corp., which is based in Tennessee, has provided over 12,000 PPP loans to date, and has helped keep hundreds of small businesses afloat during the pandemic. These success stories are not unique, as many regional banks have worked tirelessly to provide vital support to their local communities.

Some investors are also drawn to regional banks because of their strong financial positions relative to the big banks. Unlike the major banks, many regional banks have managed to avoid taking significant losses on their loan books in recent years. This is partly due to their more conservative lending practices, which have helped them weather past economic downturns.

In addition, regional banks have been able to benefit from the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cuts, as many of these institutions are highly dependent on net interest margins (NIMs) for a large portion of their earnings. As interest rates fall, banks are able to offer cheaper loans to customers, which can stimulate lending activity and help boost revenues.

However, investing in regional banks does come with its own set of risks. For one, these institutions typically have smaller asset bases than their larger counterparts, which can make them more vulnerable to economic shocks. In addition, some regional banks may have exposure to industries that have been hit hard by the pandemic, such as hospitality and travel.

But for some investors, the potential rewards may outweigh the risks. According to a recent report from CFRA Research, many regional banks are trading at a steep discount relative to their historical valuations. This could present an opportunity for investors to buy in at a low price and potentially see significant gains in the long run.

In addition, some regional banks may be attractive targets for acquisition by larger institutions. As the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the economy, many smaller banks may struggle to survive in the face of mounting losses and declining revenues. This could create an opening for larger banks that are looking to add to their footprint and expand their customer base.

One bank that has already caught the eye of potential acquirers is BBVA Compass, which is based in Alabama. In November of last year, BBVA announced that it would be selling its U.S. operations to PNC Financial Services Group in a deal valued at $11.6 billion. The move was seen as a sign that regional banks may be attractive targets for acquisition, especially as the economic fallout from the pandemic continues to intensify.

Of course, not all regional banks are created equal, and investors would be wise to carefully scrutinize the financial health of any institution before investing. Some regional banks may be better positioned to weather the storm than others, and some may offer more attractive growth opportunities than their peers.

But for those investors who are willing to do their due diligence, regional banks could offer an attractive opportunity to capitalize on a potential economic recovery. As the pandemic continues to unfold, Main Street investors may be wise to keep their eyes on the banks in their local communities, and to consider whether these institutions could be attractive additions to their investment portfolios.",1
105,Southeastern US cities in greater peril from rising sea levels,"Climate change is causing sea levels to rise, and cities in the southeastern United States are facing greater risk than others. According to a recent report by Climate Central, many areas in this region are sinking while sea levels are rising, which creates a perfect storm for disastrous consequences.

Cities like Miami, Charleston, and New Orleans are some of the most at risk. In Miami Beach, flooding is already a common occurrence, and many buildings are being affected by salt corrosion. Charleston has experienced flooding in its historic downtown area, while New Orleans is vulnerable to hurricanes and storm surges.

The impact of rising sea levels extends beyond just property damage. Coastal communities face an increased likelihood of infrastructure damage and power outages, which can disrupt daily life for thousands of people. Additionally, many low-income communities occupy these areas, which means that they may not have the resources to relocate or rebuild after a disaster.

It is clear that action is necessary to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels. This may include implementing more stringent building codes, investing in infrastructure projects that can resist sea-level rise, and finding ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to act now could result in disastrous consequences for these vulnerable communities.",1
106,Matthew McConaughey says he and Woody Harrelson might be brothers,"Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey has come out with a shocking revelation: he and fellow actor Woody Harrelson might be long-lost brothers.

McConaughey made the revelation during a recent appearance on ""The Howard Stern Show."" When asked about his close friendship with Harrelson, the Oscar-winning actor revealed that the two men were so close that they had even considered the possibility that they might share the same DNA.

""We've talked about it,"" McConaughey said. ""He thinks it's plausible, and I think it's very possible, too.""

The revelation has set off a flurry of excitement among fans of the two actors. Social media platforms are buzzing with speculation about the possibility of a McConaughey-Harrelson family connection.

Some fans have pointed out that the two men share certain physical similarities. Both McConaughey and Harrelson are known for their rugged good looks and Southern charm. They have also both played characters known for their laid-back personalities and devil-may-care attitudes.

Others have noted that McConaughey and Harrelson have worked together on several projects, including the hit television series ""True Detective"" and the feature film ""Edtv."" The two actors have also been spotted hanging out together in various locations around the world, including on tropical beaches and at music festivals.

Despite the mounting speculation, neither McConaughey nor Harrelson has offered any concrete evidence to support the theory that they might be related. However, McConaughey did admit that he had always been curious about his ancestry.

""I've done the ancestry.com thing, but I haven't gone all the way back to figure out who my great-great-great-great-grandparents were,"" he said. ""Maybe Woody and I need to get on that.""

Harrelson, for his part, has not commented publicly on the matter. However, the usually private actor has been known to share anecdotes about his friendship with McConaughey in interviews over the years.

In one interview, Harrelson called McConaughey his ""spirit animal,"" citing the actor's positive outlook on life as a source of inspiration.

""He has a way of making everything feel like an adventure,"" Harrelson said. ""I look up to him a lot as a friend and as an actor.""

Despite the excitement surrounding the ""McConaughey-Harrelson brothers"" theory, some fans have expressed skepticism. Some social media users have pointed out that it is not uncommon for people to feel a strong connection with others who share similar interests or backgrounds, even if they are not related.

Others have noted that McConaughey has a reputation for being somewhat eccentric, and that the revelation could be seen as just another example of his quirkiness.

Despite the skeptics, however, it seems that the idea of a McConaughey-Harrelson family connection is here to stay. Fans of the actors are sure to keep speculating and searching for any clues that might confirm their theory. And in the end, whether or not the two men are actually brothers, their bond as friends and collaborators remains one of the most enduring and inspiring in Hollywood.",1
107,These robotic trash cans were filmed to test human-robotic interactions. Watch what happened,"Robots are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily routines, including waste management. Researchers at Stanford University have been testing a new kind of robotic trash can, designed to work collaboratively with humans in public spaces. They were filmed carrying out tests that showed how people interacted with the robots.

The trash cans can identify and sort waste, making recycling easier and more efficient in public spaces. They are also equipped with sensors that allow them to navigate through crowds and avoid collisions. However, the key to their success is how well they integrate with human activity.

This was the focus of the Stanford researchers' study. They observed how people in public spaces interacted with the robots, and how the robots interacted back. During the tests, the researchers found that people were generally amazed by the technology, and were eager to learn more about how it worked.

The trash cans responded by engaging with people, giving them tips on recycling and explaining how they worked. They were programmed to be friendly and approachable, leading to positive interactions. A spokesperson for the researchers said that ""it was great to see how easily people accepted the robots and how curious they were to learn more about them"".

As technology continues to advance, human-robotic interactions will become a bigger part of our lives. This research shows that it is possible to develop robots that work alongside people in a positive way. It is a promising step towards a more automated future, where robots can assist us in completing everyday tasks.",1
108,South Korea claims 'considerable amount' of information in leaked Pentagon documents is fabricated,"South Korea Claims 'Considerable Amount' of Information in Leaked Pentagon Documents is Fabricated

South Korea has cast doubt over the authenticity of the leaked Pentagon documents that reportedly contain sensitive information about the country's defense strategy, military capabilities, and counterterrorism plans. The South Korean government has claimed that a ""considerable amount"" of the information in the documents is fabricated and does not accurately reflect the country's current security posture. The government has also called for an investigation into the source of the leak and the motives behind it.

The leaked documents were reportedly prepared by the US Department of Defense for the US-South Korea joint military exercises that took place in August 2020. The exercises were conducted amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula and involved tens of thousands of US and South Korean troops, as well as advanced military hardware and simulations of various scenarios, including a full-scale invasion by North Korea.

The leaked documents, which were first reported by the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, contained details about the joint military exercises and the deployment of US strategic assets, such as B-52 bombers, F-22 stealth fighters, and aircraft carriers. The documents also allegedly revealed South Korea's plans to quickly neutralize North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities, as well as its contingency plans for an all-out war, including the use of tactical nuclear weapons.

However, the South Korean government has disputed the accuracy of the leaked documents and has accused Chosun Ilbo of ""selectively"" reporting on the parts that are ""biased"" and ""distorted."" The government has also denied the existence of some of the information in the leaked documents, such as the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, which it says is not part of its defense strategy.

""The information that Chosun Ilbo has reported on is not accurate,"" said a statement from the South Korean Defense Ministry. ""A considerable amount of the information is fabricated, and some of it is outdated or irrelevant. We strongly condemn any attempt to disseminate false and distorted information that can harm our national security and undermine our credibility.""

The South Korean government has not provided any evidence to support its claims of fabrication, nor has it specified which parts of the leaked documents are inaccurate. The government has also not commented on whether the leak was an act of espionage or a deliberate attempt to discredit South Korea's defense posture.

However, some experts have suggested that the leak could be a result of cyber espionage by North Korea or China, both of which have advanced cyber capabilities and are known to target sensitive information related to neighboring countries' defense posture.

""This could be a classic case of cyber espionage, where a foreign actor has hacked into the US Defense Department's systems and stolen sensitive information about South Korea's strategy and capabilities,"" said Jang Se-yul, a former North Korean military officer who defected to South Korea in the 1990s. ""North Korea and China are the prime suspects, as they have the motive, opportunity, and capability to carry out such attacks.""

Others have pointed out that the leak could be an inside job, carried out by a disgruntled or ideologically motivated US or South Korean official who had access to the classified documents.

""This could be a case of whistleblowing by a government insider who wants to expose the flaws and dangers of the US-South Korea military alliance,"" said Bruce Cumings, a professor of Korean history at the University of Chicago. ""Or it could be a case of sabotage by someone who wants to derail the diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea and unify the Korean Peninsula.""

The leak has sparked a heated debate in South Korea about the country's defense strategy and the role of the US in its security. Many South Koreans view the US-South Korea military alliance as vital to their national security but also worry about the risks of being dragged into a war with North Korea or being used as a pawn in the escalating rivalry between China and the US.

""The leak of the Pentagon documents has exposed the vulnerability of our national security and the ambiguity of our defense strategy,"" said Jung Chang-hyun, a defense analyst at the Sejong Institute. ""We need to reassess our security posture and strengthen our capabilities to deter and defend against any threat, whether it comes from North Korea, China, or any other country.""

The leak has also raised questions about the reliability of US intelligence and its ability to protect its allies' sensitive information. The Pentagon has declined to comment on the leak, citing its policy of not discussing sensitive intelligence matters. However, some US officials have expressed concerns about the potential fallout from the leak and the damage it could do to the US-South Korea alliance.

""This is a serious breach of security and trust, and it could have far-reaching consequences for our relationship with South Korea and our ability to gather and share intelligence,"" said John Bolton, a former national security adviser to President Donald Trump.

The leak comes at a delicate time for the US-South Korea alliance, as the two countries are grappling with the North Korea nuclear crisis and the growing rivalry between the US and China. The Trump administration has tried to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles but has failed to make significant progress. Meanwhile, China has stepped up its economic and diplomatic ties with North Korea and has signaled its readiness to play a more active role in resolving the Korean Peninsula issue.

The leak could also complicate the efforts to revive the stalled diplomacy between North Korea and the US, which had made some progress in 2018 but has since stalled due to disagreements over the pace and scope of denuclearization.

""The leak of the Pentagon documents is a setback for the diplomacy between North Korea and the US and could embolden North Korea to adopt a more aggressive stance,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Wilson Center. ""It could also push South Korea to adopt a more independent and assertive foreign policy, which could create friction with the US.""

Despite the controversy and uncertainty surrounding the leaked documents, some analysts say that they provide valuable insights into the thinking and capabilities of South Korea's military and could help North Korea and China to better understand and counter them.

""While the leak is regrettable and potentially dangerous, it also shows how transparent our military is and how seriously we take the security of our country,"" said Moon Seong-min, a professor of international relations at Korea National Diplomatic Academy. ""It also shows that we need to be more vigilant and proactive in protecting our sensitive information and countering cyber threats.""

The leak of the Pentagon documents is a reminder of the complex and evolving security challenges facing the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region. It also highlights the importance of maintaining a strong and reliable US-South Korea alliance that can deter and defend against any threat and promote peace and prosperity in the region.",1

111,Why Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson have 'nothing to hide' on 'Sibling Revelry' podcast,"Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson have been making waves in the podcasting world with their hit show, 'Sibling Revelry'. The brother-sister duo has been captivating audiences with their humorous and heartwarming conversations about family, relationships, and life in the entertainment industry. But what sets their podcast apart from others is their willingness to be completely open and honest with their listeners.

In a recent interview with CNN, Kate and Oliver talked about the inspiration behind 'Sibling Revelry' and their approach to sharing their personal lives with the world.

""I think we both felt like there was something missing in the world of podcasting,"" Oliver said. ""There are so many great shows out there, but a lot of them are focused on one topic or one guest. We wanted to create a platform where we could just have real conversations with each other and share our stories with anyone who wants to listen.""

Kate agreed, saying that their goal was to create a show that felt like a ""warm hug"" for their listeners.

""We wanted to create a space where people could come and feel like they're sitting down with us and just having a chat,"" she said. ""And I think part of that is being completely open and honest with each other and our audience. We have nothing to hide.""

Indeed, the siblings have been refreshingly candid on 'Sibling Revelry', sharing everything from their childhood memories to their struggles with mental health. In one episode, Oliver opened up about his experience with addiction and how it affected his relationship with his family. In another, Kate talked about her decision to have her breast implants removed.

Some might argue that sharing such personal details on a public platform is risky, but for Kate and Oliver, it's all about fostering a sense of connection with their fans.

""I think people appreciate when celebrities are honest and vulnerable,"" Kate said. ""It makes them feel like they're not alone in their own struggles. If we can make someone feel seen or understood through our podcast, that's the ultimate goal.""

Of course, there are some topics that the siblings prefer to keep private. As Oliver put it, ""We have boundaries, but they're not really set in stone. It's just a matter of knowing when to hold back and when to let loose.""

Kate added that they have a mutual respect for each other's privacy and feelings.

""We both have our own lives and relationships outside of the podcast, and we don't want to jeopardize those by oversharing,"" she said. ""But at the same time, we trust each other to know what's appropriate to talk about and what's not.""

So far, their approach seems to be working. 'Sibling Revelry' has been a hit with listeners, consistently ranking in the top ten on the Apple Podcast charts. And as the podcast continues to grow, Kate and Oliver have big plans for the future.

""We definitely want to bring on more guests who have interesting stories to tell,"" Oliver said. ""But at the end of the day, it's always going to be about our relationship with each other and sharing our own experiences.""

Kate added that they hope to use their platform to inspire others to have similar conversations with their own siblings or loved ones.

""I think our podcast has shown that it's possible to have deep, meaningful conversations with family members without it turning into a fight or an argument,"" she said. ""We want to encourage people to have those conversations and connect with each other on a deeper level.""

In a world where so much of celebrity culture is focused on image and perception, Kate and Oliver Hudson are a breath of fresh air. Their willingness to be vulnerable and honest with their audience is not only entertaining, but it's also inspiring. With 'Sibling Revelry', they've proven that sometimes the most meaningful conversations can happen between siblings.",1
112,Asia's new generation of luxury watchmakers and entrepreneurs,"The luxury watchmaking industry has traditionally been dominated by European brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, and Cartier. However, a new generation of watchmakers and entrepreneurs from Asia is starting to make its mark. These companies are challenging the traditional notions of luxury and introducing innovative designs, materials, and technology into the world of watchmaking.

One such company is Hong Kong-based Ming, which was founded in 2017 by watch collector and designer Ming Thein. The brand uses high-quality Swiss movements and designs minimalist, Bauhaus-inspired watches with unique finishing and dial textures. Another company, Singapore-based Azimuth, has gained attention for its unconventional watch designs inspired by science fiction and pop culture.

In Japan, independent watchmakers Hiroshi and Masako Yoshida have gained a following for their creative and unique timepieces that incorporate traditional Japanese crafts such as Urushi lacquer and Aizu cotton. Meanwhile, in China, the Shanghai Watch Company has been revitalized under the ownership of Fiyta, one of China's largest watchmakers. The brand is now producing high-quality timepieces that fuse Chinese aesthetics with Swiss craftsmanship.

Besides watchmakers, Asia's new generation of entrepreneurs is also making waves in the luxury industry. Tan Guo Liang, founder of Singapore-based luxury goods company, The Hour Glass, has been instrumental in introducing niche, independent brands to the Asian market. Another notable entrepreneur is Kevin Ching, who was previously the CEO of Sotheby's Asia and now heads the up-and-coming auction house, Asian Art Auction Alliance.

As Asia's economic power grows, these new watchmakers and entrepreneurs are a testament to the region's increasing influence and creativity in the luxury industry.",1
113,TikTok banned from school-owned devices at all Florida state universities,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently passed a bill that bans the use of TikTok on all school-owned devices at State University campuses. The move has only added to TikTok's woes as it faces increasing scrutiny over its data privacy policies amid concerns of user data being shared with the Chinese government.

This news was first announced in August, when the Board of Governors for the State University System of Florida voted unanimously to ban the use of TikTok on all school-owned devices. The decision came after national security concerns were raised about the Chinese-owned video-sharing app, which was under review by the US government for its handling of user data.

According to Governor DeSantis, the ban on TikTok is a necessary step to ensure that students' data and information remain safe and secure. The governor stated that ""the Chinese Communist Party's espionage and theft of American intellectual property pose a grave threat to the security and integrity of our nation's digital infrastructure.""

The move has received both support and criticism, with some stating that it is a necessary step to protect national security, while others say that it infringes on students' rights to access social media platforms.

TikTok, which is currently the most downloaded app in the US, has over 100 million users, with a significant number of them being college students. The app allows users to create and share short-form videos, which has made it very popular among younger generations.

Users can create videos on a variety of topics such as dance, music, comedy, and education. The app also has a feature that allows users to duet with each other, which has become a hit among users, enabling them to collaborate and create content together.

However, TikTok has recently come under scrutiny over its data privacy policies. US lawmakers have raised concerns that the app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, could be handing over user data to the Chinese government.

There have also been allegations that the app censors content that is critical of the Chinese government. Earlier this year, TikTok was accused of censoring videos related to the Hong Kong protests, which sparked outrage among users.

TikTok has denied these allegations, stating that it stores user data in the US and Singapore and has strict data privacy policies. The company also announced that it plans to set up a data center in the US to further allay concerns about the security of user data.

However, the allegations have not gone away, with US lawmakers continuing to call for a ban on the app over national security concerns. The ban on TikTok in Florida is just the latest move in this ongoing debate.

The ban on TikTok in Florida has caused concern among students who use the app for entertainment and education purposes. Some students have expressed frustration over the decision, stating that it infringes on their ability to access and engage with social media platforms.

Others have raised concerns about the potential impact on their studies, as they use TikTok to create and consume educational content. There are also fears that the ban will lead to further restrictions on social media access on campus, which could limit free speech and academic freedom.

However, despite these concerns, there are potential benefits to the ban on TikTok. The move could help to prevent potential data breaches and protect students' personal information. It could also serve as a wake-up call to other social media platforms to take data privacy and security policies more seriously.

Furthermore, the ban could lead to the development of alternative platforms that prioritize data privacy and security. As concerns about data privacy continue to grow, there is a growing demand for social media platforms that are transparent and accountable about how they collect, store, and use user data.

The ban on TikTok by Florida State University is also likely to influence other universities and colleges across the country to consider similar measures. This would ultimately lead to a change in how social media platforms are used and regulated at educational institutions.

In conclusion, while the ban on TikTok in Florida has raised concerns among students and advocates of free speech, it is ultimately a necessary step to protect personal information and prevent potential data breaches. As the use of social media platforms continues to grow, it is important that universities and colleges take data privacy and security seriously.

The ban may also serve as a catalyst for change, leading to the development of alternative platforms that prioritize user privacy and security. It is up to technology companies to respond to the growing concerns around data privacy and take meaningful steps to ensure that user information is handled responsibly and ethically.",1
114,"4 dead, including a child, following overnight domestic violence incident and police shooting in Orlando","Orlando, Florida - Tragedy struck a residential area in Orlando as 4 people, including a child, lost their lives in a brutal domestic violence incident that ended in a police shooting.

The incident occurred late on Tuesday, at a home in the Lake Nona area of Orlando, when police received multiple calls regarding a domestic violence dispute. As officers arrived at the scene, they were confronted by an armed man who was later identified as Gary Lindsey Jr.

Lindsey, a 35-year-old father of four, had reportedly been involved in a heated argument with his girlfriend earlier in the evening. She later called the police to report that Lindsey was potentially dangerous and that he had access to firearms.

As the officers tried to negotiate with Lindsey, he allegedly opened fire on them, injuring one officer. The police officers retreated from the home and called for backup, prompting the deployment of the SWAT team.

The standoff between Lindsey and the SWAT team lasted for hours, during which Lindsey held his girlfriend and her two children, aged 1 and 6, as hostages. The scene was tense as police and SWAT team members surrounded the house, trying to negotiate with Lindsey and safely evacuate the hostages.

However, the situation took a tragic turn as the SWAT team entered the home early on Wednesday morning. Lindsey had barricaded himself in a room with the hostages, and as the team attempted to enter the room, he opened fire.

The police officers returned fire, killing Lindsey, but unfortunately, in the exchange, the 4 hostages lost their lives. The youngest victim was just 1-year-old.

The news of the incident has sent shockwaves across the community, with many expressing disbelief and sorrow at the tragic turn of events. The Orlando Police Chief, John Mina, expressed his condolences to the family of the victims and praised the bravery of the officers involved in the operation.

""This is a tragedy for our community, and our hearts go out to the family of the victims who have been impacted by this senseless act of violence,"" Mina said. ""The officers and SWAT team members involved in the operation showed incredible bravery and commitment to their duties in the face of extreme danger.""

The incident highlights the persistent issue of domestic violence in the United States, which has been on the rise in recent years. According to a report by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an estimated 10 million people experience domestic violence each year in the United States, with an average of 20 people per minute being physically abused by an intimate partner.

The report also highlighted the impact of domestic violence on children, with 5 million children witnessing domestic violence each year, leading to long term physical and psychological damage.

The incident has also sparked debate around the issue of gun control, with many questioning how Lindsey was able to access firearms, despite the safety concerns raised by his girlfriend.

""We cannot continue to ignore the link between domestic violence and gun violence,"" said the Executive Director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Ruth Glenn. ""Without stricter gun control measures, incidents like this will continue to happen.""

The incident recalls the 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, which claimed the lives of 49 people and left dozens injured. The Pulse nightclub shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

The recent incident has once again brought the issue of gun violence to the forefront, with many urging lawmakers to take action to prevent such incidents from occurring again.

""Our hearts go out to the victims of this tragedy, and we must take action to prevent such incidents from happening in the future,"" said Congressman Darren Soto, who represents the Orlando area.

The incident has also sparked outrage amongst the local community, with many questioning the tactics used by the police and SWAT team in the operation. Some have criticized the use of lethal force, which resulted in the death of the hostages, while others have questioned whether more could have been done to peacefully resolve the situation.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and further details are expected to emerge in the coming days.

In conclusion, the tragic incident in Orlando highlights the persistent issue of domestic violence and gun violence in the United States. While the incident has shocked the community, it has also spurred a much-needed conversation around the need for stricter gun control measures and the importance of addressing domestic violence. The nation must come together to provide support and resources to those affected by such senseless acts of violence and take the necessary steps to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.",1
115,Sarah Paulson financially helped friend Pedro Pascal early in his career,"Sarah Paulson, the award-winning actress known for her remarkable performances in American Horror Story, Game Change, and other hit TV shows and movies, has helped her longtime friend and fellow actor Pedro Pascal financially during his early days of struggling to make his career in Hollywood.

In an interview with CNN, Pascal, who is now famous for his role in the Disney+ hit series The Mandalorian, revealed that he had to overcome significant financial challenges in his early career days. He said that he moved to Los Angeles with hardly any money in his pocket and that he struggled to make ends meet. It was during this time that Paulson gave him the much-needed financial help that he needed.

""I was broke when I first moved to LA. I knew nobody in LA, and one of the first huge friends that I made was Sarah Paulson. She lent me money when I needed it, and I think that sort of also informed our friendship because I was so vulnerable, and she saw me in my darkest hour,"" Pascal said.

The two actors first met while attending the Circle in the Square Theatre School in New York. They bonded over their shared passion for acting, and over the years, their friendship grew stronger. Even when Pascal moved to LA, their friendship remained strong, with Paulson always being there for him.

Pascal is now one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood, but he hasn't forgotten the help that Paulson gave him when he most needed it. In fact, he said that the experience helped him understand the true meaning of friendship.

""When you go through something like that, it's a real-deal moment of truth in terms of who's looking out for you,"" he said. ""And Sarah didn't have to do that, you know what I mean? She didn't have to loan me money, and she did, and it was a real demonstration, for me, of the kind of person she is.""

Paulson, who is known for being a private person, rarely talks about her personal life or her financial generosity. However, in a 2016 interview with Elle, she revealed that she had indeed helped a friend who was struggling financially, although she didn't mention Pascal by name.

""When I was working on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, I had a friend who was working on a Broadway show, and she was struggling to make ends meet. I knew that she was going to lose her apartment, so I gave her some money to help her out,"" Paulson said.

The two actors have worked together on several projects over the years, including the film Serenity, in which they played brother and sister. Pascal said that working together on the movie was a dream come true for him.

""It's very rare that you get to work with somebody that you love and admire and respect as much as I do Sarah,"" he said. ""To get to play her brother and to have that kind of intimate relationship onscreen was really incredible for me.""

The Mandalorian cemented Pascal's star status, with his portrayal of the masked bounty hunter Din Djarin winning him numerous fans worldwide. The show has been praised for its groundbreaking use of technology, which creates a seamless blend of live-action and computer-generated imagery.

Despite the show's phenomenal success, Pascal has remained humble and grateful for the opportunities that have come his way. He said that he feels lucky to have had a chance to work with some of the industry's top talents, including Paulson.

""I feel like I've been very blessed in my career,"" he said. ""I've had a lot of people who have been very kind to me and taken a chance on me, and Sarah was definitely one of those people.""

Paulson's act of kindness towards Pascal serves as a reminder that even in the cutthroat world of Hollywood, there are still people who value friendship above all else. Her generosity helped one of her closest friends achieve his dreams and gave him the support that he needed to keep going in the face of adversity.

As Pascal's career continues to soar, it's clear that his friendship with Paulson is as strong as ever. He said that he remains grateful for everything that she has done for him and that he's proud to be her friend.

""We've been through a lot together, and I think that bonds you in a way that nothing else can,"" he said. ""I know that if I ever needed anything, Sarah would be there for me, and I would be there for her. That's what real friendship is all about.""",1
116,US wholesale inflation saw dramatic cooldown in March,"Washington (CNN) - The latest data on wholesale prices in the United States has shown a much-welcomed decline, giving rise to optimism among economists that inflation may not be the biggest challenge for policymakers in the near future.

The Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, dropped by 0.5% in March, according to a report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is the first time the index has fallen since May of last year, and it was a larger drop than many analysts had anticipated. Notably, the PPI for final demand goods fell by a more significant 1.0%, reflecting plunges in fuel and food prices. On an annual basis, the overall PPI increased by just 1.0%, down from a high of 4.2% in November 2021.

This dramatic cooling in wholesale inflation is a welcome relief for policymakers grappling with rising consumer prices, continued supply chain disruptions, and the potential for lingering Covid-19 related uncertainties. The Federal Reserve has utilized both interest rate adjustments and quantitative easing to try to support the economy through this difficult period, but it has also had to consider the potential risks of overheating and inflation. The recent PPI data offers some breathing room on this front.

""We have been closely monitoring the rise in inflation, and these latest figures are a welcome reprieve,"" said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. ""We will continue to monitor market data for signs of inflationary pressure, but we are encouraged by the recent deceleration of wholesale prices.""

Powell's remarks come as many investors and economists have begun to question whether the Federal Reserve's inflation concerns were overblown. The central bank's Beige Book, a report on economic conditions across the country, indicated that businesses have been reluctant to pass on higher costs to consumers, and that many companies were experiencing supply chain issues rather than actual production bottlenecks.

While a drop in wholesale prices may not immediately translate into lower consumer prices, it could eventually relieve some of the pressures that have led to rising costs for households in recent months. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the costs of goods and services purchased by households, rose 0.6% in March, its highest monthly increase since the fall of 2009. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the index increased by 2.6% over the past year.

If the PPI decline continues, it could eventually lead to a lower CPI. But economists warn that this is not guaranteed, as other factors, such as labor shortages and supply chain disruptions, could still push prices higher. Additionally, with the US economy continuing to recover from the pandemic, there is the potential for stronger consumer demand to put upward pressure on prices.

""Wholesale prices are only one component of the broader inflation picture, and there are other factors that could still push consumer prices upward,"" said Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics. ""But this is a positive sign, and it gives us hope that we may not see the worst-case inflation scenarios play out.""

Some analysts have suggested that the recent spike in inflation may be a temporary phenomenon, driven in part by the massive government stimulus measures passed in response to the pandemic. As the economy regains its footing, prices may stabilize or even decline. However, others warn that ongoing supply chain disruptions, coupled with higher demand, could continue to push prices up for the foreseeable future.

""The inflation picture is still quite uncertain,"" said James Knightley, Chief International Economist at ING. ""We need to wait and see how various factors play out over the coming months. But certainly, this decline in wholesale inflation is a positive development.""

The PPI data also comes as President Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats push forward with their infrastructure plan. The $2.3 trillion package aims to invest in a broad range of areas, from roads and bridges to clean energy and broadband internet. While many economists believe that the plan could help provide a boost to the economy, some have raised concerns about its potential impact on inflation.

""It's certainly possible that the infrastructure plan could lead to inflationary pressures, but much will depend on the specifics of the package,"" said Zandi. ""If it focuses on areas like broadband and clean energy, it could help generate productivity gains that offset any inflationary pressures. But if it's focused heavily on traditional infrastructure projects, there's more risk of higher costs and price pressures.""

While the PPI data has offered some reason for optimism, it is too soon to say that the US economy is out of the woods when it comes to inflation. A variety of factors, including ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and the potential for stronger consumer demand, could still push prices higher in the coming months. However, the decline in wholesale inflation is certainly a positive development, and one that many policymakers will welcome as they continue to chart a course through a challenging economic landscape.",1
117,Shelter-in-place order lifted for neighborhoods near a burning fishing vessel in Washington,"SEATTLE, WASHINGTON- The shelter-in-place order for neighborhoods near a burning fishing vessel has been lifted this morning. The order was issued yesterday afternoon after a commercial fishing vessel caught fire at the Fishermen’s Terminal in Seattle. The incident caused a significant amount of smoke and led to concerns about air quality in the surrounding areas.

The Seattle Fire Department responded to the scene just before 4 pm on Saturday. According to officials, the 100-foot-long fishing vessel, named the ‘Pacific Sounder,’ was in the process of being refueled when the fire started. The vessel, which belongs to the Seattle-based Ocean Peace Inc., was carrying over 6,000 gallons of fuel at the time of the incident.

Fortunately, there were no reported injuries in the incident, but the fire caused significant damage to the vessel. “It was a pretty intense fire, and it took us several hours to extinguish,” says Seattle Fire Department spokesperson Kristin Tinsley.

The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Still, Tinsley said that leaky fuel lines are a common problem that could ignite, leading to fires in boats. The fishing vessel was undergoing a routine fuel transfer when the fire broke out.

The Seattle Fire Department worked tirelessly Saturday evening and into Sunday morning to control the fire and prevent it from spreading to other vessels in the area. “The firefighters did a fantastic job of containing the fire,” said Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan in a statement. “We are grateful for their quick response and ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of our community.”

City officials issued a shelter-in-place order for several surrounding neighborhoods due to concerns about air quality. The order was lifted this morning after air quality measurements in the area came back within safe limits.

“It’s always unfortunate when incidents like this happen in our community,” said Mayor Durkan in a statement. “But the city’s response shows how prepared we are to handle emergencies and keep our residents safe.”

Fishermen’s Terminal is home to over 700 commercial fishing vessels and is a vital part of Seattle’s maritime industry. Officials say that the Pacific Sounder’s loss will have a significant impact on the local fishing community.

The Pacific Sounder is estimated to be worth around $5 million and was insured, according to Ocean Peace Inc. Owner Dale Kelley says he is devastated by the loss. “We are deeply saddened by the fire that destroyed our vessel, the Pacific Sounder. Our crew is safe, and no one was injured. The investigation is ongoing, but we’re determined to get to the bottom of what caused this tragedy.”

Kelley says that the company is working with local authorities to salvage the vessel and minimize the environmental impact of the incident. The fishing vessel’s fuel tanks were reportedly not breached during the fire, but there are concerns about fuel and oil leaking into the water.

“This is a critical issue for us,” says Chris Wilke, Executive Director of Puget Soundkeeper Alliance. “We’ll be monitoring the situation closely, and we’ll work with authorities to ensure that every possible step is taken to protect the environment.”

Fans of ‘Deadliest Catch’ will no doubt be familiar with Fishermen’s Terminal, which has featured prominently on the popular Discovery Channel show. The area has a long history of commercial fishing and is a significant part of Seattle’s heritage. City officials say that the fishing industry provides thousands of jobs and generates billions of dollars in economic activity each year.

The incident is a sobering reminder of the risks that come with working in the maritime industry. Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Fishermen face a range of hazards, including harsh weather conditions, unstable work surfaces, and machinery accidents.

Still, accidents like the one at Fishermen’s Terminal are relatively rare. City officials say that the Seattle Fire Department is one of the best-equipped and trained fire departments in the country.

The incident will no doubt generate discussion about safety procedures in the maritime industry and the need for increased regulations. But for now, investigators will be focused on determining the cause of the fire and assessing the environmental impact of the incident.

As Seattle residents breathe a sigh of relief following the lifting of the shelter-in-place order, communities in the surrounding areas will be keeping a close eye on developments in the coming days and weeks. The incident is a stark reminder of how quickly things can go wrong, even in an industry as essential and tightly regulated as commercial fishing.",1
118,Maternity wards across the US are closing because of this issue,"Maternity wards across the US are facing a serious issue as they grapple with the shortage of obstetricians and other medical staff. As a result, several maternity wards have been forced to close down, leaving expectant mothers with no choice but to travel long distances to give birth.

According to recent reports, rural areas have been the worst hit, with more than half of them lacking access to maternity care. The root of the problem lies in a series of factors including low Medicaid reimbursements and high malpractice insurance costs, which are driving obstetricians out of practice. Many physicians are also facing burnout due to the long hours and extensive workload.

The closure of maternity wards is a significant concern for pregnant women, particularly those living in rural areas, where transportation can be a challenge. The lack of care exposes them to risks of complications during pregnancy and delivery, which could have life-threatening consequences.

It is time for policymakers to address this crisis and invest in expanding access to maternity care across the country. The safety of the mother and the child should be a top priority, and no woman should have to travel long distances to give birth.",1
119,FDA sketches out plan to bolster fragile US infant formula supply management,"In recent years, the United States has faced a number of challenges in managing the supply of infant formula. From issues with contamination and recalls to concerns about infant health and access, the complex system that produces and distributes formula has been under increasing scrutiny. Now, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has unveiled a new plan to help bolster the country's fragile supply chain and protect the health and well-being of infants across the country.

The new plan, outlined in a detailed report released earlier this month, draws on a range of strategies and approaches to address the many challenges facing the infant formula industry today. From improving surveillance and monitoring to strengthening regulations and standards, the FDA's plan is a comprehensive and ambitious effort that seeks to transform the way infant formula is produced and distributed in the U.S.

The importance of infant formula to the health and well-being of babies cannot be overstated. For many families, formula is a key source of nutrition for infants during their critical early stages of development. It is estimated that almost 20% of infants in the United States are formula-fed, with approximately two-thirds of these infants consuming it exclusively. Given the important role that formula plays in the health of these children, it's essential that we get the management of this supply chain right.

One of the key challenges facing the infant formula industry today is the issue of contamination. Over the past several years, there have been a number of cases of contamination in infant formula, which have led to recalls and widespread concerns about the safety of these products. In response, the FDA has included in its new plan a range of measures to improve surveillance and monitoring of the industry.

The FDA's plan also seeks to strengthen industry regulations and standards. This includes developing new standards for the quality and safety of infant formula, as well as implementing new processes for registration and certification. Additionally, the plan will aim to address issues with infant formula labeling and packaging, including clearer and more informative labels and warnings about potential health risks.

Another important focus of the FDA's plan is improving access to infant formula, particularly for low-income families. The report outlines several strategies for addressing this issue, including expanding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to include infant formula, as well as working with non-profits and other community organizations to provide formula to families in need.

Finally, the FDA's plan emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and collaboration. Given that many of the ingredients used in infant formula are sourced from other countries, it's essential to have strong international partnerships and agreements in place to ensure the safety and quality of these products. The FDA will be working closely with its counterparts in other countries to improve the global supply chain for infant formula.

Overall, the FDA's new plan is an important and necessary step forward in the management of the U.S. infant formula supply chain. By addressing a wide range of issues and challenges, from contamination and safety to access and regulation, this plan seeks to ensure that every infant in this country has access to safe, nutritious formula that supports their healthy growth and development. While there is still much work to be done in implementing these strategies and achieving these goals, the FDA's new plan provides a roadmap for a more secure and sustainable future for the infant formula industry.",1
120,This startup wants to turn tuk-tuks into a roaming power supply,"In developing countries, tuk-tuks are a common mode of transportation, often used to ferry passengers around busy streets for a relatively low price. However, one startup is thinking outside the box and wants to turn these three-wheeled vehicles into a roaming power supply.

The Indian-based startup, Mwindoo, is developing a system that enables tuk-tuks to generate renewable energy as they drive through city streets. The company's Electric Tuk Tuks (ETT) system works via a combination of solar panels, batteries, and a smart meter that tracks energy usage in real-time.

The idea is that the tuk-tuks' solar panels will generate energy throughout the day, which will then be stored in onboard batteries. This energy can then be depleted as the vehicle is driven, providing a reliable and sustainable source of energy without having to tap into traditional power grids.

Mwindoo's ETT system provides a number of benefits. It allows tuk-tuk drivers to have a steady source of income, charging customers for their rides while also selling electricity back into the grid. As a result, the system could help alleviate poverty in rural areas where there is a lack of reliable energy sources.

The startup is currently piloting its ETT system in selected cities throughout India before looking to expand into other parts of Asia and Africa. With backing from the Indian government and other investors, Mwindoo is aiming to transform the transportation landscape across the developing world, while also driving a clean energy revolution.",1
121,Tesla is opening a Megafactory for huge batteries in China,"Tesla is set to open its first Megafactory in China, where the company will manufacture its signature electric vehicle batteries. This move marks a significant milestone for Tesla as it looks to expand its operations in the fastest-growing electric vehicle market in the world.

The factory, situated in Lingang, about 30 kilometers south of Shanghai, represents a long-awaited achievement for Elon Musk's company. The new factory aims to produce vehicles and batteries with a focus on developing a greener transportation system in the country that has the highest CO2 emissions globally.

In a statement announcing the new facility, Tesla stated that the Gigafactory would transform the company's ability to provide affordable and clean energy solutions to the world. This new factory will also allow Tesla to tap into China's enormous market and compete with home-grown manufacturers in the world's most massive auto market.

The Lingang Gigafactory is not Tesla's first production facility outside the US. The company already has another Gigafactory in Nevada, which has helped Tesla to become the largest battery manufacturer globally. This new factory will see Tesla significantly increase its production potential, ensuring that the company establishes a more significant presence in China.

China is home to the world's largest auto market, and the country is planning to phase out fossil fuel-powered vehicles completely in the coming years. The Chinese government is looking to promote the use of electric vehicles as a way of reducing pollution and carbon emissions. The country has already been successful in its push to increase the number of electric vehicles on its roads, with electric vehicle sales rising by 62% in 2018.

China has been instrumental in Tesla's growth, and the company is looking to solidify its position in the country even further. The country accounts for around 20% of Tesla's overall revenue, and this new factory will enable the company to expand its customer base even further. The opening of this factory marks the culmination of several years of planning and effort from Tesla.

The Lingang Gigafactory is expected to cover approximately 210 acres, which is significantly larger than Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory, which spans around 106 acres. The size of the Lingang factory will allow Tesla to increase its battery production and produce vehicles on this site, further solidifying the company's position in the Chinese market.

Tesla initially announced its plans to open this factory in 2018, and construction began in early January 2019. Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, Tesla pushed ahead with its plans to open the factory, and it looks set to become operational in 2021. The company has invested heavily in this new factory, with reports indicating that it has spent over $5 billion on the project.

The opening of Tesla's Lingang Megafactory is expected to have a significant impact on the Chinese market. The Chinese electric vehicle market is growing at an unprecedented rate, with demand growing every year. With Tesla's new Gigafactory, the company will be able to produce more batteries, which will, in turn, lead to a more significant supply of electric vehicles in the market.

The Chinese authorities have welcomed Tesla's move, with the Shanghai government providing significant support to the company. The government has made the project a priority and has provided a wide range of incentives to Tesla to encourage it to set up shop in the city. The authorities offered Tesla favorable loans, subsidies, and a range of other incentives to secure the company's investment.

The Chinese authorities are also looking to encourage other foreign companies to invest in the country's auto industry. The Chinese government has made significant efforts to attract foreign companies, and it has established several free trade zones to attract investment. The opening of Tesla's Megafactory is a crucial moment for the country, as it showcases China's ability to attract foreign investment.

The opening of the Gigafactory will also impact the global electric vehicle market. Electric vehicles have become increasingly popular around the world, with the number of electric vehicles on the roads rising significantly every year. A study conducted by the International Energy Agency in 2020 revealed that the global electric vehicle market is set to double by 2030, and China is a key market for this growth.

Tesla's Lingang Gigafactory will enable the company to tap into this growing demand for electric vehicles, and it will help position the company as a global leader in the space. With its ability to manufacture its signature batteries at a more significant scale, Tesla will be able to offer its electric vehicles at a more affordable price point, making them more accessible to a broader range of consumers.

The Chinese market is also essential for Tesla as it looks to maintain its competitive advantage over other electric vehicle manufacturers. China is a highly competitive market, and the country's home-grown manufacturers have made significant strides in the past few years.

Tesla faces significant competition from companies such as NIO, Li Auto, and XPeng, who dominate the Chinese market. To maintain a competitive advantage, Tesla will need to continue to invest in research and development, improve its manufacturing processes and develop high-quality electric vehicles.

The opening of the Lingang Megafactory will enable Tesla to increase its production of batteries and electric vehicles, which could give the company a competitive edge. The Chinese market is highly competitive, and Tesla must differentiate itself to succeed in the country. The company's focus on developing high-quality electric vehicles, coupled with its expertise in battery technology, will enable it to stand out in the market.

Another significant advantage Tesla has in the Chinese market is its reputation. Over the years, the company has built a strong brand name that has helped it retain its market share. The company's reputation for producing high-quality electric vehicles has been reinforced by positive online reviews and a dedicated fan base of electric vehicle enthusiasts.

The company's reputation has proven to be a significant selling point, and it is something that the company must continue to cultivate. With the opening of the Megafactory, Tesla can build on this reputation by producing high-quality electric vehicles on a more significant scale.

The Chinese government is looking to create a greener transportation sector, and electric vehicles are an essential part of this plan. Tesla's Lingang Megafactory will enable the company to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries on a more significant scale, which will help to reduce carbon emissions and promote a more sustainable transportation system.

China is a key market for Tesla if the company is to maintain its position as a global leader in the electric vehicle market. The country represents a significant opportunity for the company, with its growing demand for electric vehicles and favorable government policies. The opening of the Lingang Megafactory is a crucial moment for the company, as it looks to expand its operations in the country and maintain its market position.

In conclusion, the Lingang Megafactory represents a significant milestone for Tesla as it seeks to expand its operations in the Chinese market. The factory will enable the company to produce batteries and electric vehicles on a more significant scale, solidifying its position as a leading player in the electric vehicle market. The opening of the Megafactory is an important moment for the Chinese market, as the country looks set to become a global leader in the shift towards a more sustainable transportation system.",1
122,"JPMorgan executives knew about sex abuse claims against then-client Jeffery Epstein, court filing alleges","New York, NY - JPMorgan Chase & Co. executives knew about allegations of sexual abuse against then-client Jeffrey Epstein as early as 2015, according to a court filing submitted by the victims' legal team.

Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell last year while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors, was a wealthy financier who had used JPMorgan's private bank for more than a decade.

The filing, submitted as part of a lawsuit against the bank by Epstein's victims, alleges that JPMorgan employees ignored red flags about Epstein's behavior and helped him move money around despite their knowledge of his alleged crimes.

""JPMorgan chose to continue doing business with Epstein despite receiving numerous warnings about his conduct,"" said Robert Glassman, one of the attorneys representing Epstein's victims. ""The bank was more interested in profiting off Epstein's wealth than in protecting the young women he was abusing.""

The court filing includes emails and other documents that allegedly show JPMorgan employees becoming increasingly concerned about Epstein's behavior as early as 2015.

In one email from August of that year, a bank executive wrote that Epstein's reputation was ""a bigger risk than most clients,"" according to the filing. The executive also wrote that he was ""not comfortable"" with some of Epstein's transactions and told colleagues that the bank should ""tread carefully.""

Another email from a JPMorgan compliance officer expresses concern about Epstein's use of multiple accounts to move money around, calling it a ""risk"" that the bank should ""follow closely.""

Despite these warnings, JPMorgan continued to do business with Epstein until 2019, when he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking.

The bank has not denied that its employees knew about the allegations against Epstein but has said that it was not aware of the full extent of his illegal activity.

""We deeply regret that we failed to catch this person's reprehensible actions earlier,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement last year. ""We are committed to learning from our mistakes and doing better in the future.""

But the victims' legal team argues that JPMorgan bears some responsibility for Epstein's crimes.

""The bank had a duty to report Epstein's suspicious activity to law enforcement, which it failed to do,"" Glassman said. ""JPMorgan's actions allowed Epstein to continue his abuse unchecked for years.""

JPMorgan has faced criticism in the past for its handling of high-profile clients accused of misconduct. The bank was fined $1.1 billion in 2014 for failing to alert authorities to suspicious activity by Bernard Madoff, who was later convicted of running a massive Ponzi scheme.

In response to the allegations against JPMorgan, several lawmakers have called for greater oversight of the banking industry.

""JPMorgan's handling of the Epstein case is just the latest example of how big banks put profits above people,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. ""We need to break up these too-big-to-fail institutions and hold them accountable for their actions.""

The victims' legal team is seeking unspecified damages from JPMorgan in the lawsuit, which is still ongoing.

Epstein's death in jail last year has raised questions about the circumstances surrounding his arrest and prosecution. Some of his victims have accused the government of failing to hold him accountable for his crimes, while others have alleged that Epstein was murdered to prevent him from revealing damaging information about his powerful friends and associates.

The case has also highlighted the issue of sexual abuse by wealthy and powerful individuals, with many advocates calling for greater protections for victims and stronger laws to hold abusers accountable.

""Our clients are seeking justice not just for themselves but for all the young women who were victimized by Jeffrey Epstein and others like him,"" Glassman said. ""We hope that this case will send a message to the banking industry and others that they cannot turn a blind eye to abuse and exploitation.""",1
123,French protesters storm headquarters of luxury giant LVMH,"In the early hours of Tuesday morning, thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Paris, culminating in an unprecedented attack on the headquarters of luxury giant LVMH. The demonstrators were demanding immediate action on climate change and a fairer distribution of wealth within French society.

The group, known as ""Extinction Rebellion France"", had been organizing protests throughout the city over the past week. However, the demonstration outside the LVMH headquarters quickly turned violent, as protesters entered the building and began destroying office equipment and art pieces.

The attack on LVMH, which owns several luxury fashion and perfume brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy, has sent shockwaves through the fashion industry. Many luxury brands rely on French craftsmanship and pride themselves on their iconic status, but the recent events have highlighted the growing frustration among French citizens towards the perceived inequality perpetuated by these brands.

In an interview with CNN, a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion France explained the motives behind the protest: ""The climate crisis threatens our very existence, and yet those in power seem to prioritize their own profits over the need for urgent action. LVMH represents the epitome of this greed and overconsumption, and we demand that they take responsibility for their actions and contribute to a more sustainable future.""

The protests, which were fueled by social media campaigns and word-of-mouth advertising, attracted a diverse range of participants, including students, environmentalists, and working-class citizens. Many were drawn to the idea of taking direct action against powerful corporations, rather than relying on indirect forms of protest such as petitions and lobbying.

However, the French government has criticized the violent nature of the demonstration, and local authorities have launched an investigation into the incident. In a statement released by the Interior Ministry, the government condemned ""any form of violence and destruction of public or private property, which undermines our democracy and the rule of law.""

The incident highlights the growing tension between citizens and corporations, as well as the government's struggle to address the concerns of its citizens. French President Emmanuel Macron, who has faced criticism for his perceived lack of action on climate change, has promised to increase funding for renewable energy and tighten regulations on carbon emissions. However, many citizens believe that these measures are not enough, and that more radical action is needed to address the scale of the crisis.

The attack on LVMH also raises questions about the role of luxury brands in society, and whether their products are ethically and environmentally sustainable. Many fashion houses have come under scrutiny in recent years for their reliance on cheap labor and environmentally damaging production processes. However, these issues are often overlooked in the pursuit of profit and prestige.

In an open letter addressed to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, Extinction Rebellion France called on the company to take responsibility for its contribution to climate change and to transition towards a more sustainable business model. ""Your brands are symbols of excess and luxury, and yet the planet cannot sustain this level of consumption,"" the letter stated.

The incident has also sparked a wider debate about the role of direct action in addressing social and environmental issues. While some have criticized the violent nature of the protest, others argue that it is a necessary response to decades of inaction and indifference towards the climate crisis.

In a statement released on social media, Extinction Rebellion France defended their actions: ""We understand that the destruction of property is not a popular or easy decision, but we believe that it is a necessary one. People's lives are at stake, and we cannot rely on those in power to make the necessary changes. It is up to us to demand a better future.""

However, the incident has also highlighted the risks and challenges of direct action. The perpetrators of the attack now face the prospect of legal action, and the incident has prompted questions about the effectiveness of violent protest in achieving lasting change.

As the dust settles on the events of Tuesday morning, the fashion industry and wider society are left to grapple with the implications of the attack on LVMH. While many will condemn the violence and destruction, others will see it as a wake-up call to the urgent need for action on climate change and social justice.

As Extinction Rebellion France stated in their letter to Bernard Arnault, ""We urge you to listen to the demands of the people and to use your immense power and influence to create a better world for all."" Whether LVMH and other luxury brands will heed this call remains to be seen.",1
124,North Korean crypto heist funding nuclear ambitions,"North Korea is known to have a knack for hacking and cyber warfare, and recent reports suggest that the country is using these skills to fund its nuclear ambitions. According to cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, North Korean hackers have stolen more than $600 million worth of cryptocurrencies since 2017.

This crypto heist seems to be part of a larger strategy to circumvent international sanctions and acquire the funds needed to finance North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are particularly attractive to the country because they are difficult to trace and can be used to hide transactions from traditional banking channels.

Recorded Future's report also suggests that North Korea is investing heavily in its own cryptocurrency, exploring the potential to use it as a means of evading sanctions and accessing international markets. It's a troubling development that could further destabilize global security and highlights the urgent need for stronger cybersecurity measures.

As North Korea continues to seek ways to finance its military programs, countries must remain vigilant against these sophisticated cyber attacks and work to counteract them.",1
125,Why Walmart is closing half its stores in Chicago,"Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has announced its decision to close half of its stores in Chicago - a move that has left many questioning the company's motives and impact on the community. The decision will result in the closing of ten stores, leaving many employees without jobs and communities without a vital source of affordable goods. The move is said to be a cost-cutting measure, but critics argue that it is yet another example of the company's disregard for the well-being of the people it serves.

The 10 Walmart stores that will close their doors include four Walmart Supercenters and six Walmart Neighborhood Markets. These stores employ around 1,500 workers in total, many of whom will be left without jobs as a result of the closures. The affected stores are located in the South and West sides of Chicago, a region that has long been neglected by large retailers.

Walmart cited poor performance as the reason for the closures. In a statement, the company spokesperson said, ""After a careful and thoughtful review process, we have made the difficult decision to close a number of stores in the Chicago market. This action is necessary to ensure that we are doing everything we can to operate as efficiently as possible, and to position our business for future success.""

However, many have criticized Walmart for its lack of transparency and for not providing sufficient notice to its employees or the community. Alderman Carrie Austin, who represents one of the affected areas, expressed her disappointment in the company's decision, saying, ""I just think it's a travesty, the way they're treating the people in my community.""

The closure of Walmart stores in Chicago is also seen as a blow to the communities that rely on them for affordable goods. Walmart has long been championed for its low prices, which make it a go-to destination for families on a budget. The company's withdrawal from these communities means that residents will have to look elsewhere for affordable groceries and other necessities.

Critics of Walmart have pointed to the company's contentious history with workers' rights and its alleged negative impact on local economies. The company has been accused of paying workers low wages, providing inadequate healthcare benefits and disregarding workers' rights to unionize. Walmart has also been accused of driving locally-owned businesses out of communities, which has led to job losses and a decline in the quality of life for residents.

While Walmart's decision to close stores in Chicago may be viewed as a cost-cutting measure in response to poor performance, some have speculated that there may be other factors at play. In recent years, the company has faced increased competition from online retailers like Amazon and the expansion of other big-box retailers like Target. Additionally, Walmart has faced growing pressure from investors to increase its profits and return more value to shareholders.

Some experts suggest that Walmart's decision to close stores may be part of a broader strategy of consolidation and retreat. The company has faced criticism in recent years for its aggressive expansion strategy, which has left many communities over-saturated with Walmart stores. By closing stores in some regions, the company may be looking to refocus its efforts on profitable markets and improve its overall performance.

However, others argue that Walmart's decision to close stores in Chicago is yet another example of the company's disregard for the well-being of the communities it serves. Walmart has long been criticized for its impact on local economies, job creation and labor standards. The closure of these stores will likely deepen socio-economic inequalities in the affected communities and leave workers without jobs and benefits.

In response to Walmart's decision, some community activists and labor organizations have called for boycotts and protests. Others have called for the company to reinvest in the communities it serves and provide better wages and benefits to workers. The closure of Walmart stores in Chicago is just one example of the ongoing tensions between large corporations and the people and communities they serve. As income inequality continues to grow and communities face increasing economic insecurity, it is clear that the role of large retailers like Walmart will continue to be debated and challenged.",1

127,Yellen: 'Not anticipating a downturn' in the US economy,"The United States economy has been on an upward trend for the past few years, with unemployment rates declining and economic growth slowly but steadily increasing. However, there are concerns about the possibility of a downturn in the near future. Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve, has recently commented on this issue, saying that she is ""not anticipating a downturn"" in the US economy.

In a recent interview with CNN, Yellen discussed her perspective on the current state of the US economy and where it may be headed in the coming years. She expressed confidence in the strength of the economy, noting that the current labor market is ""very strong"" and that economic growth is ""solid."" She also emphasized the importance of sustainable growth, rather than the short-term gains that can be achieved through policies like tax cuts.

Yellen's comments are in line with many other economic experts, who have been optimistic about the outlook for the US economy. While there are certainly risks and uncertainties on the horizon, such as the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, most analysts believe that the fundamentals of the US economy remain sound.

One of the key factors driving the current economic expansion in the US is the tight labor market. Yellen noted that there are currently more job openings than there are unemployed workers, a phenomenon that has not been seen in the US in many years. This has led to rising wages and increased demand for workers, which in turn has helped to drive economic growth.

Another factor contributing to the economic expansion is the recent tax cuts implemented by the Trump administration. While Yellen did not directly comment on these cuts, she emphasized the importance of sustainable economic growth, which she said requires ""investment, education, and support for workers."" This suggests that she may be somewhat skeptical of the long-term benefits of tax cuts, which are often viewed as a short-term boost to the economy that may not be sustainable over the long-term.

Despite her overall optimism about the US economy, Yellen did acknowledge that there are some warning signs that could potentially indicate a downturn in the future. She noted that corporate debt levels are quite high, particularly in the leveraged lending market. This could lead to problems down the road if companies are unable to meet their debt obligations.

Additionally, Yellen expressed concern about the potential for inflation to rise above the Fed's target of 2%. While she did not indicate that she saw any immediate risk of this happening, she noted that the tight labor market and the recent tariff increases could potentially push inflation higher in the future.

Overall, Yellen's comments suggest that while there are certainly risks and uncertainties facing the US economy, she is optimistic about the current state of affairs. She emphasized the importance of sustainable economic growth and expressed confidence in the strength of the current labor market. While there are no guarantees when it comes to the economy, Yellen's expertise and insights provide a valuable perspective on the outlook for the US in the years ahead.",1
128,'Not enough': Low-wage workers continue to grapple with inflation,"As the economy continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic, low-wage workers are still struggling to make ends meet due to inflation. With the cost of essential goods, such as food and gas, on the rise, many workers are finding that their paychecks simply do not stretch far enough.

Despite efforts to raise the minimum wage, many workers still earn less than $15 an hour, making it nearly impossible to keep up with the rising costs of living. Many low-wage workers are essential workers, such as those in the service and healthcare industries, who have continued to work throughout the pandemic, putting themselves at risk to keep society running.

While the federal government has implemented various measures to provide financial relief to Americans affected by the pandemic, such as stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits, these measures often fall short for low-wage workers. Many are unable to access these benefits due to being undocumented or lacking the necessary documentation.

The lack of sufficient support for low-wage workers is not only a moral issue but an economic one as well. Without the purchasing power of these workers, businesses will struggle, which will have a ripple effect on the overall economy.

It is crucial that policymakers address the needs of low-wage workers in their efforts to create a more equitable society. Until then, these workers will continue to grapple with inflation and struggle to make ends meet.",1
129,'Unstable' unleashes Rob Lowe in an uninspired father-son Netflix comedy,"Netflix has premiered a new comedy series titled ""Unstable,"" starring Rob Lowe and Albert Tsai. The father-son duo takes center stage in a laugh-out-loud, yet uninspired attempt to tell a well-worn story that feels all too familiar.

The show revolves around a single father, Chris, played by Lowe, with a complicated past and his 16-year-old son, Declan, played by Tsai, who he's been relatively estranged from. The two are forced to navigate life under the same roof, and hilarity ensues—or at least, that’s the idea.

""Unstable"" is a prime example of how good intentions can lead to missed opportunities. It’s not entirely Lowe’s fault - even his effortless charm and comedic timing can’t lift the script above mediocrity. Despite his best efforts, he simply doesn't have much to work with.

Moreover, the writing often feels clichéd and leaves much to be desired. The pilot episode alone is riddled with predictable dad jokes, predictable sarcasm between the father and son, and an array of tired one-liners. The attempt at humor feels more desperate than organic.

For instance, in the series’ opening scene, Chris walks into a supermarket, only to be greeted by an anonymous teen who says, ""Hey, aren't you that guy who used to be something?"" Given the unmistakable hint that Chris was once famous, viewers might assume (like Declan) that he was once a movie star or music legend. But no, he was merely a pitch man for a pharmaceutical product.

As the episode unfolds, the audience gets a better sense of the chasm that exists between former child star Chris and his son. The pilot sets up a few gags, but the “laughs” are too sporadic to make anything else stick. And while Lowe's effortless smile carries some of the load, Tsai appears to have been miscast despite his previous roles. He's adequate, yet his character is one-note and doesn't offer much to the storyline.

One of the major issues that ""Unstable"" faces is a severe lack of character development. The show's central figures are painted in broad, bland strokes. Chris is the wacky but ultimately cool dad, while Declan is the sarcastic, know-it-all son. They mostly converse in one-liners, punctuated with enough ""oh, you"" winks to signal their mutual affection.

Despite the weak character development, there's a sincere effort to flesh out some of the supporting characters. For instance, Faiza (played by Mona Mira), a neighbor whom Chris takes a liking to, is the only person in the cast with an actual job. Also, her backstory isn't entirely straightforward, which gives her character some depth. Additionally, Diego Ramos (played by Jose Moreno Brooks), an old friend of Chris', comes across as a ridiculous caricature of the worst of LA's hipster culture.

""Unstable"" also explores themes of redemption and reconciliation, which are infused into several moments throughout the show's eight-episode arc. Chris is continually atoning for his past indiscretions, both with his son and his followers on social media. Similarly, Declan finds himself opening up to his father, initially out of necessity, only to find himself growing closer to him as days go by.

Despite the fastidious groundwork laid by the show creators to make the characters feel relatable and fleshed out, their anticlimactic arcs don't always hit the mark. At its core, the show has the potential to provide viewers with a heartwarming story of forgiveness and growth, but often fails in execution.

The show also suffers from a lack of creativity concerning its setting. Set in Los Angeles, it's clear that Netflix isn't aiming for a groundbreaking depiction of the city. The show's Los Angeles is merely a backdrop: There are some palm trees, pools, and vague references to Shake Shack. There's little emphasis placed on the city's vibrancy or diversity, which might attract local audiences and serves as a missed opportunity.

Lowe, who is an executive producer on the show, has been candid about his struggles as a father, both on and off set. But those candid feelings don't often translate into stronger writing. As a result, ""Unstable"" fails to satisfy. It’s a featherweight series with a forgettable sound.

In conclusion, ""Unstable"" may be short-lived, and that might be for the better. In a true testament to the old adage about the best intentions, the show's producers aimed to provide a unique take on a familiar story but fell short of the mark. Despite Rob Lowe's electric charm and Monica Mira's intensity, the series never quite finds the comedic niche it aimed for. Ultimately, ""Unstable's"" flaws make it unremarkable, and another one-note addition to an already crowded Netflix lineup of mediocre sitcoms.",1
130,"A 2019 hearing detailed potential fire hazards at the now-burning Indiana recycling plant, and its owner admitted a building did not have fire sprinklers","In the early hours of May 23, 2021, a massive fire broke out at the Recycling Center in New Haven, Indiana. The fire department responded immediately, sending dozens of firefighters and trucks to battle the blaze. The fire, fueled by piles of cardboard and paper products, quickly spread, and flames shot high into the sky. Over the course of several hours, the firefighters were able to bring the flames under control, but the aftermath of the fire was devastating.

The Recycling Center was destroyed, and the surrounding area was covered in a thick layer of ash and debris. The cost of the damage was estimated to be in the millions of dollars, and officials began to investigate what had caused the fire. As they dug deeper, they discovered that this was a disaster that could have been prevented.

A hearing held in 2019 detailed potential fire hazards at the Recycling Center, and the owner admitted that one of the buildings on the site did not have fire sprinklers. Despite these warnings, nothing was done to address the hazards, and now, the consequences are catastrophic.

The hearing, which was held by the New Haven Planning Commission, focused on the lack of fire safety measures at the recycling plant. According to the testimony, the facility was storing large amounts of cardboard and paper products, which are highly combustible. There were also concerns raised about the potential for fires caused by the plant's equipment.

During the hearing, the owner of the Recycling Center, John Davis, admitted that one of the buildings on the site did not have fire sprinklers. He explained that the building was used for storage and was not occupied by employees, so he had not seen the need to install sprinklers.

This admission was deeply troubling, as the lack of sprinklers meant that any potential fire would be able to spread quickly and uncontrollably. The fact that the building was not occupied by employees is also irrelevant, as fires can start at any time, regardless of whether there are people present.

Despite the seriousness of the situation, the Planning Commission did not order the installation of sprinklers or take any other preventative measures. Instead, they issued a warning to the Recycling Center and asked them to submit a fire safety plan within a week.

This response was not enough, and the lack of action has now resulted in a catastrophic fire. A fire that could have been prevented if the proper safety measures had been put in place.

Since the fire, local officials have expressed their frustration and anger at the Recycling Center and its owner. They have criticized the lack of preventative measures and the failure to address the hazards that were detailed in the 2019 hearing.

Mayor Steve McMichael of New Haven has been particularly vocal in his criticism. In a statement released after the fire, he said, ""This is a disaster that could have been prevented if proper safety measures had been taken. It is unacceptable that the hazards outlined in the 2019 hearing were not addressed, and now, we are left to deal with the aftermath of a devastating fire.""

In response to the criticism, John Davis, the owner of the Recycling Center, has defended his actions. He has stated that he takes safety very seriously and that he did not see the need for sprinklers in the building in question.

However, his words ring hollow in the face of the devastation caused by the fire. The fact remains that proper safety measures were not taken, and now, the consequences are dire. The Recycling Center is destroyed, and the surrounding area is left to deal with the fallout of a massive fire.

This disaster should serve as a wake-up call for businesses and officials everywhere. Fire safety is not something that can be taken lightly, and the potential consequences of neglecting it are severe. The precautions and measures taken to prevent a fire are minimal compared to the costs of dealing with the aftermath of one.

In light of this tragedy, it is imperative that all businesses and officials take a closer look at their fire safety measures. They must address any potential hazards and ensure that they have the proper equipment and procedures in place to prevent a disaster like the one that occurred at the Recycling Center.

In conclusion, the fire that destroyed the Recycling Center in New Haven, Indiana, was a preventable tragedy. The 2019 hearing detailed potential fire hazards at the plant, and the owner admitted that a building did not have fire sprinklers. Despite these warnings, no action was taken, and now, the consequences are catastrophic. This disaster should serve as a reminder of the importance of fire safety and the need for preventative measures to be taken seriously. We must learn from this tragedy and take action to prevent future disasters.",1
131,"Pet cats and dogs may help protect infants from food allergies, study suggests","Pet cats and dogs are not just great companions, they also have the potential to protect infants from food allergies. This is according to the latest study conducted by researchers from the University of Alberta, Canada. The research findings which were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology suggest that pets may be a new weapon to fight against food allergies.

Over the past few decades, food allergies have become increasingly common, and their prevalence has been well documented. Research has shown that in the United States alone, about 32 million people have food allergies, out of which 5.6 million are children. Food allergies can lead to anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction, and can take a significant toll on a person's quality of life.

There have been many theories about why food allergies are on the rise, and one of them is the hygiene hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that our modern-day obsession with cleanliness is affecting our immune system's ability to fight off infections and diseases. The hypothesis further suggests that being exposed to certain bacteria and viruses in early childhood helps to train the immune system, which in turn reduces the risk of developing allergies.

This study focused on understanding the relationship between pets and food allergies. Lead author Anita Kozyrskyj, a pediatric epidemiologist at the University of Alberta, and her team analyzed data from over 700 infants who were enrolled in a Canadian research project. The infants were followed closely until their first birthday to assess their risk of food allergies.

The researchers found that infants who lived in households with pets were less likely to develop food allergies by the time they turned one. Specifically, they found that being exposed to pets at home during gestation or in the first three months of life was associated with a 50% reduction in the risk of developing food allergies.

These findings are significant because they suggest that pets may be a new way to protect infants from developing food allergies. ""Earlier studies have shown that exposure to pets, particularly dogs, during pregnancy and the first year of life reduces the risk of asthma,"" said Kozyrskyj. ""Our findings are the first to show that pets may also reduce the risk of food allergies in infants.""

The study also found that the protective effect of pets was stronger in households that had higher levels of microbial exposure. This supports the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that being exposed to more bacteria and viruses can help to train the immune system and reduce the risk of allergies.

The researchers believe that pets could be helping to introduce beneficial bacteria into the home, which in turn helps to strengthen the infant's immune system. ""Exposure to pet dust was associated with a higher abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been previously linked to protection against allergic diseases,"" said Kozyrskyj.

The study has limitations, as it is not entirely clear how exposure to pets prevents food allergies. Some researchers have suggested that it could be due to changes in the gut microbiome, while others believe that it could be due to changes in the infant's immune system.

Regardless of the exact mechanism, the findings suggest that pets could be a new way to prevent food allergies and improve the overall health of infants. This is particularly important given the high prevalence of food allergies and the fact that there is currently no cure for this condition.

The study has been welcomed by many experts in the field of allergies. Dr. Gideon Lack, professor of allergy and pediatric allergy at King's College London, said: ""This is a very interesting study, and it adds further weight to the hygiene hypothesis, which suggests that our modern-day environments may be too clean and that we need to be exposed to more microbes to train our immune system.""

Dr. Lack further added that ""The study suggests that pets could be a way of introducing beneficial bacteria into the home, which could be good for immune system development. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between pets and allergies.""

The study also has implications for pet owners who are considering getting a pet for their family. While pets can be great companions and provide many health benefits, they require a lot of care and attention. Pet owners should ensure that they provide their pets with adequate nutrition, exercise, and veterinary care to ensure that they remain healthy and happy.

In conclusion, pets could be a new way to fight against food allergies. The study suggests that being exposed to pets during pregnancy or in the first three months of life could reduce the risk of developing food allergies by 50%. While more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between pets and allergies, these findings are significant and could have implications for the prevention and treatment of food allergies in the future.",1

133,"'The Marvels' teaser trailer brings Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris together","The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has had a tremendous impact on pop culture over the last decade. Now, the Marvel Studios' latest project, ""The Marvels,"" is bringing three powerful female superheroes together to fight evil in the universe.

The first teaser trailer for ""The Marvels"" was released on Monday, and it features Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel, and Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, who we saw first in ""WandaVision."" The trailer was a true feast for the eyes and had fans all over the world excited about what the MCU has in store for us next.

""The Marvels"" is the sequel to the 2019 film, ""Captain Marvel,"" which introduced us to Larson's character, Carol Danvers. In ""The Marvels,"" Captain Marvel will meet Ms. Marvel and Monica Rambeau as they take on an enemy that threatens the universe. Each character has their unique powers, and it will be interesting to see how they work together to save the day.

The trailer opens with a shot of an unknown place. The camera zooms in on a metallic structure with bright turquoise lights. The camera then cuts to Carol Danvers sitting in a car, and the voiceover says, ""I've been fighting bad guys since before you were born."" The scene then cuts to Ms. Marvel's hometown in Jersey City, where she is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, displaying her incredible powers. The voiceover continues, ""Some people move on, but not us.""

The trailer sets up an exciting intergenerational dynamic between the three heroines. Captain Marvel, who has been fighting bad guys for decades, will mentor Ms. Marvel, a teenager with an insatiable curiosity for her powers. Meanwhile, Monica Rambeau, who was a child in the 1990s and grew up admiring Captain Marvel, has also gained superpowers and will join the team.

One of the best moments in the trailer was when Ms. Marvel fangirls over Captain Marvel. When the two meet, Kamala Khan, Ms. Marvel's alter ego, is clearly starstruck. She exclaims, ""I know you're a superhero!"" Larson's character dryly responds, ""I am not a superhero...yet."" It's a funny moment that shows the two characters' different personalities.

The three characters are also part of a larger trend of diversity within the MCU. Brie Larson is the first woman to lead an MCU film, and Iman Vellani is the first Muslim superhero in the MCU. Teyonah Parris's Monica Rambeau is Black, and her appearance in ""WandaVision"" was groundbreaking for Marvel. All three women represent a significant departure from the typical superhero archetype, and it's refreshing to see them embrace their own powers and identities fully.

Although the trailer doesn't give much away, we do get a brief glimpse of what appears to be the villains. One shot shows a group of spaceships descending from the sky, and another depicts a figure with Dr. Octopus-like metal arms.

Fans are sure to be thrilled with this teaser trailer, and it has certainly got the internet talking. ""#TheMarvels"" and ""#captainmarvel"" are trending on Twitter, and every second, there are more and more reactions to the trailer. Fans of the comics and previous MCU movies alike are excited to see these three powerful women come together in a new adventure.

The MCU has had a lot of success over the past decade, with each new film building on the previous ones. The movies have told a larger story that has captivated audiences and kept them coming back for more. ""The Marvels"" will likely continue this trend, as it brings together some of the most exciting characters in the MCU.

One potential challenge for ""The Marvels"" is that it may be difficult to balance three characters adequately. Fans want to see all of their favorite superheroes shine and have satisfying arcs, but it's not easy to accomplish that with a large ensemble cast. On the other hand, ""The Avengers"" managed to pull it off, so there's no reason to doubt that ""The Marvels"" will do the same.

Overall, the ""The Marvels"" teaser trailer has got fans excited for the future of the MCU. With Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris leading the charge, we can expect to see some thrilling action, snappy dialogue, and powerful moments of heroism. As the voiceover in the trailer says, ""We're going to take you back to where it all began."" And if the teaser is anything to go by, this will be a journey worth taking.",1

135,What you need to know about the Marburg virus,"What you need to know about the Marburg virus

Marburg virus is a deadly virus that first emerged in 1967 in the German town of Marburg. It is a close relative of the Ebola virus and is one of the most deadly viruses known to man. Despite being less well-known than Ebola, the Marburg virus has caused several devastating outbreaks since its discovery, claiming countless lives and causing widespread panic.

In this article, we will explore what you need to know about the Marburg virus, including its history, transmission, symptoms, treatment, and prevention.

History of Marbug virus

The Marburg virus was first identified in 1967 when an outbreak occurred among laboratory workers in the German town of Marburg. The outbreak was linked to the handling of primates imported from Uganda for research purposes. Since then, the virus has caused several other outbreaks, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.

The most recent outbreak occurred in Uganda in 2017, where the virus claimed one life. The outbreak was quickly contained, thanks to the swift response of the Ugandan government and international health organizations.

Transmission of Marburg virus

The Marburg virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected people, such as blood, saliva, urine, and vomit. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats and primates.

People at high risk of contracting the virus include healthcare workers, family members and caregivers of infected patients, and people who hunt or handle infected animals.

Symptoms of Marburg virus

The symptoms of Marburg virus typically appear within two to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The initial symptoms are similar to those of the flu and include fever, headache, and muscle aches. As the disease progresses, it can cause severe bleeding, organ failure, and shock. The disease can be fatal in up to 90% of cases.

Treatment of Marburg virus

There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for the Marburg virus. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as keeping the patient hydrated, managing their symptoms, and providing oxygen therapy. Research is ongoing to develop a vaccine and other treatments for the virus.

Prevention of Marburg virus

Preventing the spread of Marburg virus requires a combination of education, infection control measures, and surveillance. Healthcare workers and other people at risk of contracting the virus must be trained in infection control measures, such as wearing protective clothing and masks, and proper disposal of contaminated materials.

Public health officials and government agencies must also be prepared to respond rapidly to outbreaks, by setting up isolation facilities and providing supportive care to infected patients.

Surveillance is also key to preventing the spread of the virus. Efforts must be made to identify and isolate infected patients, trace their contacts, and monitor the spread of the disease.

Global response to Marburg virus

The Marburg virus is considered a potential bioterrorism agent, and as such, the international community has taken steps to address the potential threat of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the Marburg virus as a Priority Pathogen under the WHO Blueprint for Research and Development.

The WHO has also developed guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Marburg virus, and works closely with governments and other organizations to monitor and control outbreaks.

Conclusion

The Marburg virus is a deadly virus that remains a threat to public health in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. While there is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus, measures can be taken to prevent its spread, including education, infection control measures, and surveillance.

Efforts must also be made to develop effective treatments and vaccines for the virus, and to strengthen public health systems to respond rapidly to outbreaks. The global community must work together to prevent future outbreaks of the Marburg virus, and to ensure that those affected by the virus receive the care and support they need.",1
136,See this moose on the loose in an Alaskan hospital,"Visitors to a hospital in Kenai, Alaska were in for a big surprise when they encountered a moose wandering around the hospital lobby. The unexpected visitor caught hospital staff and patients off guard, but thankfully no one was hurt during the encounter.

The moose was caught on camera, and the footage quickly went viral on social media. Local officials say it's not uncommon to see moose roaming around residential areas, but it's rare for them to wander into a public building.

The animal eventually found its way out of the hospital and back into the nearby woods. While the incident may seem like just another quirky moment in Alaskan wildlife, it's important to remember that these animals can be dangerous if provoked.

Residents are reminded to maintain a safe distance from moose and other wildlife, and to avoid approaching them. It's also important to properly secure trash cans and food sources to prevent attracting these animals to populated areas.

While this moose on the loose may have been an amusing sight, it serves as a reminder that we share our environment with all kinds of creatures and that we should strive to coexist safely and respectfully.",1
137,Elon Musk's weekend antics could only further crumble Twitter's brand value,"Over the weekend, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, stirred up controversy yet again with his behavior on Twitter. Musk is known for being an active user of the social media platform and has over 62 million followers. However, his recent antics have not only put him in hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but also further tarnished Twitter's already-fragile brand value.

Musk's weekend tweets started innocuously enough. On Friday, he tweeted about his upcoming appearance on SNL and asked for skit suggestions. However, he then went on to tweet a poll asking whether he should ""turn some Dogecoin into MarsCoin"". Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that started off as a joke but has since gained a massive following, while Marscoin is a lesser-known cryptocurrency.

This tweet caused Dogecoin to surge by over 20%, as Musk's tweets have been known to have a significant influence on the stock market. However, it also raised concerns about Musk's power to manipulate the market and the SEC's tightening regulations on social media usage by public companies.

Later that day, Musk tweeted that he was working with Dogecoin developers to improve its efficiency, which led to another surge in its value. He also tweeted that his company, SpaceX, was launching a satellite called DOGE-1 to the moon next year, which he claimed would be paid for with Dogecoin.

The following day, Musk tweeted a video of a Tesla car with the caption ""Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 90 mph on a residential street. Why would anyone buy a car without FSD?"". FSD stands for ""full self-driving"", which is a controversial yet desirable feature that Tesla offers in its cars. However, the tweet raised serious concerns about the safety of Tesla's technology and Musk's cavalier attitude towards it.

Musk's tweets over the weekend have once again drawn attention to his erratic behavior on Twitter and the negative impact it could have on both his companies and the platform itself. Twitter, which has faced increased scrutiny for its role in the spread of misinformation and hate speech, has struggled to maintain its brand value in recent years.

In January 2021, Twitter permanently suspended former President Donald Trump's account following his role in inciting the Capitol insurrection. The move was applauded by many, but also sparked backlash from some who claimed it violated Trump's freedom of speech.

Since then, Twitter has come under fire for its handling of other controversial figures on the platform, including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and white supremacist Richard Spencer. The platform has also faced criticism for allowing fake news and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic to spread unchecked.

Musk's recent behavior on Twitter could only further crumble the platform's brand value. His tweets have shown that even high-profile users can use the platform to manipulate the market and spread misinformation. This could lead to increased regulation of social media platforms and damage Twitter's reputation even further.

Furthermore, Musk's weekend tweets have once again raised concerns about the safety of Tesla's self-driving technology. This is not the first time Musk has made controversial claims about Autopilot and FSD. In 2018, a Tesla driver died in a crash while using Autopilot, which raised questions about the safety of the feature. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) later recommended that Tesla implement safety measures to prevent such accidents from happening again.

Twitter's brand value already took a hit following the suspension of Trump's account, and Musk's behavior could only add to the platform's troubles. It remains to be seen whether Twitter will take any action regarding Musk's tweets or if he will face any further consequences from the SEC.

In the meantime, it is clear that Musk's actions on Twitter have once again put him in the spotlight and drawn attention to the dangers of unchecked social media usage. It remains to be seen whether he will continue to use the platform in such a controversial manner, or if he will face repercussions for his actions.",1
138,"Customs officers in Philadelphia seize nearly $200K worth of counterfeit auto parts, including air bag covers","Customs officers in Philadelphia have recently seized almost $200,000 worth of counterfeit auto parts, including over 100 fake air bag covers. The bust came after a tip-off from the automotive industry and highlights the ongoing problem of counterfeit goods in the US.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the Port of Philadelphia intercepted two cargo shipments from China in late June that were declared as ""auto parts."" Upon inspection, authorities found a total of 114 air bag covers that violated intellectual property rights laws. Other counterfeit items discovered in the shipments included automotive electrical components, locks, and engine parts.

According to a CBP spokesman, the estimated retail value of the seized counterfeit auto parts was $188,899. The spokesman added that the fake air bag covers may not function correctly, putting drivers at risk in the event of a collision.

Counterfeit auto parts pose a significant risk to consumers and the automotive industry. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of counterfeit air bags causing serious injuries and even deaths. In 2019, a man in Arizona was injured when a counterfeit air bag in his Honda Civic exploded during a crash.

The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (IPR Center) praised the CBP's efforts in intercepting the counterfeit auto parts. In a statement, the IPR Center's Director Steve Francis said that ""intellectual property theft undermines America's economic competitiveness and can put American consumers at risk.""

Counterfeit goods are a growing problem in the US and around the world. In 2020, the CBP confiscated over $1.3 billion worth of counterfeit merchandise at US borders. The most common items seized included counterfeit apparel, electronics, and consumer goods.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of counterfeit goods. The demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other medical supplies has led to an increase in counterfeit products, with CBP officers seizing over 14.7 million counterfeit face masks in 2020.

The production and sale of counterfeit goods not only harms consumers and legitimate businesses but also contributes to organized crime and terrorism. The profits from counterfeit goods often fund criminal activities, including drug trafficking and human smuggling.

In response to the problem of counterfeit goods, the US government has implemented several initiatives to combat intellectual property theft. The IPR Center, a joint task force involving several government agencies, coordinates efforts to prevent the importation and distribution of counterfeit goods.

The CBP also has a ""Don't Buy Fakes"" campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of counterfeit goods and encourage consumers to purchase from legitimate sources. According to the campaign's website, counterfeit goods are often of poor quality, contain harmful materials, and lack proper safety features.

The automotive industry has also taken steps to combat the production and sale of counterfeit auto parts. In 2012, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers launched a campaign called ""Be Car Care Aware,"" which educates consumers about the importance of buying genuine auto parts from trusted sources. The campaign also highlights the risks associated with counterfeit auto parts, including decreased performance and safety hazards.

The alliance has also worked with law enforcement agencies to identify and prosecute those involved in the production and sale of counterfeit auto parts. In 2019, the alliance collaborated with the Department of Justice to shut down 16 websites that were selling counterfeit air bags.

Counterfeit auto parts are often sold online, making it difficult for consumers to differentiate between genuine and fake products. The rise of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay has made it easier for counterfeiters to reach a wider audience.

In a statement, David Bauer, CEO of the Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA), emphasized the importance of working with e-commerce platforms to combat the sale of counterfeit goods. ""The industry must work with these companies to develop tools and systems to detect and remove counterfeit and infringing products from their platforms,"" Bauer said.

The seizure of nearly $200,000 worth of counterfeit auto parts in Philadelphia serves as a reminder of the ongoing issue of counterfeit goods in the US. It also highlights the vital role played by CBP officers and other law enforcement agencies in intercepting fake products before they reach consumers.

Consumers can protect themselves from counterfeit goods by purchasing from reputable retailers and checking for authenticity markings on products. They can also report suspected counterfeit products to the CBP and other authorities.

As the demand for counterfeit goods continues to grow, it is essential that consumers remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves from harmful and substandard products. The seizure of counterfeit auto parts in Philadelphia is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to combat the problem of counterfeit goods.",1
139,The latest on hybrid work: Who is WFH and who isn't,"Introduction: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has made remote work mainstream, and organizations worldwide have been forced to embrace remote working because of its benefits. It allowed company operations to continue despite the lockdowns, restrictions, and stay-at-home orders. Employees no longer have to commute long distances or bear the expense of paying for both transportation and meals while working. Remote working has increased productivity and even reduced the organization's carbon footprint.

As vaccines roll out, organizations need to move beyond surviving to adapting to what's next. With the world reopening, a hybrid work model seems to be the future, with a balance between remote work and in-person collaboration. 

CNN has analyzed various reports, conducted surveys, and interviewed human resources experts to understand the current state of remote work in the world. This article will report and highlight key statistics, differences between WFH and WFO, and the concerns and benefits of hybrid work.

Who is WFH and who is not?

The coronavirus has caused remote work to be a new normal for many people. According to research done by Gartner's Workforce Survey, 88% of organizations encouraged or required employees to work from home during the pandemic, and 97% plan to allow employees to do some remote work. 

However, remote work isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. There are differences between WFH and WFO (Work from Office). Not everyone can work from home, nor do they want to. 

According to data compiled by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 24% of workers now have jobs that can be performed entirely from home. This figure has tripled in the last decade. These jobs are typically characterized as knowledge jobs — positions that don't require physical presence to complete the work.

In contrast, employees who work in industries such as tourism, hospitality, retail, and transportation, among others, don't have the luxury of working from home. Research by the Pew Research Center revealed that only 16% of workers who are employed in positions that typically require in-person activities have the option to work from home.

Despite the disparity between the two groups, hybrid work is seen as the way forward for most companies, including those in industries where physical presence is essential. Hybrid work creates a flexible work arrangement that accommodates both remote and in-person work.

The concerns and benefits of remote work 

A whopping 73% of company executives have declared that they will have a hybrid workforce by 2022, according to Upwork's Future Workforce Report. This is a clear indication that remote work is here to stay, and companies are looking to capitalize on its benefits.

Remote work has numerous benefits to employers and employees alike, the most striking of which is the flexibility it provides. Remote work saves employees time and money commuting to and from work, making it a win-win situation for both parties. Additionally, it increases productivity and allows better work-life balance.

However, it's not all roses. Despite the advantages of remote work, there are concerns regarding productivity and burnout. An analysis by the Harvard Business Review found that, on average, remote employees worked 1.4 more days a month than their in-office counterparts, which translates to 16.8 additional workdays in a year. This can lead to burnout if not correctly managed.

Employers are also concerned about maintaining productivity levels when employees are working outside an office environment. To ensure that employees remain productive, companies have introduced mandatory communication systems and check-ins, as well as software to monitor productivity.

On the flip side, remote workers face more challenges in terms of their well-being. Research has revealed that remote workers tend to be more stressed than employees who work on-site because of fluctuations in work hours and not being able to switch off properly. The lack of social interaction and meaningful face-to-face communication can also lead to loneliness and even depression.

The hybrid work model addresses these concerns by allowing workers to have the best of both worlds: remote work on some days and face-to-face interaction on others.

The new work-life balance 

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of work-life balance, and remote work has shown to improve it. Remote work allows employees to work at their own pace, which is why it's so appealing. When working remotely, employees can go about their day, knowing that they don't have to rush to meet a deadline or be tied down to traditional nine to five working hours.

According to Microsoft's Work Trend Index, remote workers take fewer breaks, work more hours, and have shorter lunch breaks than their in-office counterparts. With less time commuting, remote workers have more time to spend with their families or pursuing hobbies, which can improve their well-being.

To ensure optimal work-life balance, organizations have begun promoting a healthy work routine that balances work with self-care activities. Additionally, they've introduced wellness programs, which allow for physical activity, meditation, and community activities.

Conclusion: 

The coronavirus pandemic has changed the way companies work, and remote work is here to stay. The hybrid work is the way forward for most companies, allowing employees to have the best of both worlds; remote work on some days and face-to-face interaction on others.

However, the hybrid work model has its challenges, and to make it work, employers and employees need to work together. Companies need to provide employees with the tools to work effectively from home, and employees need to establish a routine that combines work and leisure activities.

The future of work is hybrid, and companies need to adapt to stay relevant. The future belongs to those companies that are flexible, adaptable, and willing to embrace new ways of working.",1

141,Twitter brands BBC a 'government funded media' organization,"Twitter is often considered a space for open dialogue and freedom of expression. However, recently, a tweet by a user has created a stir among social media users around the world. The tweet in question brands BBC, a prominent British media organization, as a 'government-funded media' organization.

The tweet was posted by a user named @rants_n, who has now closed its account. The short tweet read, ""BBC is just another government-funded media house."" While the tweet may have flown under the radar of many, it quickly caught the attention of netizens. Social media users rushed to the BBC's defense, labeling the tweet as a baseless allegation.

The backlash prompted the BBC to issue a statement in response. The statement boldly reiterated the broadcaster's commitment to impartial journalism and refuted the claims that it is a 'government-funded media house'.

The broadside from twitter sparked a debate among netizens. Some supported the views of the user, while others vehemently denied the allegations leveled against the BBC.

It is commonly known that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is funded by the license fees levied on UK households, which account for over 75% of the broadcaster's income. The remaining portion of the BBC's funding comes from the government via the licence fee settlements. However, this funding model does not necessarily make the BBC a 'government-funded media house.'

The BBC is governed by a Royal Charter, which outlines the principles of public service broadcasting that the broadcaster must adhere to. Under the charter, the BBC is legally required to remain politically impartial and independent of government control.

Experts agree that the tweet is a mischaracterization of the BBC's funding and governance. The notion that the BBC is state-owned and controlled is completely false. The Royal Charter guarantees that the BBC is independent of government control.

The tweet also appears to be part of a larger trend of attacks on the mainstream media. The political landscape in many countries has shifted dramatically in recent years, with an increasing number of politicians denouncing the press for publishing articles critical of their policies. This has led to a growing mistrust of the mainstream media among certain sections of the public.

In the UK, accusations of 'fake news' have been leveled against leading broadcasters, such as the BBC and Sky News. It seems that there is an ongoing struggle between the media and politicians over their respective roles in shaping public opinion.

However, this is not the first time that the BBC has been under attack from social media users. In recent years, social media has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theorists and anti-establishment figures who have launched attacks against the BBC and other respected news outlets.

BBC reporter, Nick Robinson, has said that the broadcaster's commitment to impartial journalism has made it a target for attack. Speaking on the issue, Robinson said, ""We are a target because of our commitment to impartiality. Those who seek to undermine us do so because they know that impartiality gets in the way of their agenda.""

Despite the attacks, the BBC has consistently ranked as one of the most trusted news sources in the UK. A recent poll conducted by YouGov found that the BBC was the most trusted news source among the public, with 57% of people saying they trusted the broadcaster to provide accurate and impartial news coverage.

The tweet, and subsequent outrage, has opened up a wider debate about the role of government funding in the media. Critics argue that government funding leads to a lack of independence and impartiality in the media, whereas proponents argue that it is necessary for the provision of public service broadcasting and is a model that is widely used in other countries.

In countries such as France and Germany, public service broadcasting is often funded by the state. La Société de l'Audiovisuel Extérieur de la France (SAEF) is funded by the state and provides news and information programming in French, Arabic, and English to audiences around the world. In Germany, the public broadcaster, Deutsche Welle, is funded by the state and operates in over 30 languages.

The BBC's funding model is not unique and can be seen as a necessary means of providing a public service. Public service broadcasting is often seen as a way of ensuring that the public has access to impartial and objective news coverage, ad-free entertainment, and quality programming.

However, critics argue that the government’s involvement makes public service broadcasters vulnerable to political influence. As we have seen recently, the BBC has been accused of being too cozy with the government and has faced calls for greater transparency in its dealings.

In conclusion, the tweet accusing the BBC of being a 'government-funded media house' mischaracterizes the broadcaster's funding and governance. The BBC is a public service broadcaster funded by households in the UK and is governed by a Royal Charter, which guarantees its independence from political interference. The tweet highlights a growing trend of distrust in the mainstream media and should serve as a reminder of the importance of impartiality and independence in journalism.",1
142,Jury selection begins in historic Dominion defamation trial against Fox News,"Jury selection begins in historic Dominion defamation trial against Fox News

In a landmark moment in the battle over the 2020 election results, jury selection has begun in the Dominion defamation trial against Fox News. The case, filed by Dominion Voting Systems, alleges that Fox News spread baseless and damaging conspiracy theories about the company's role in the election, causing irreparable harm to its reputation and business.

Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages in the case, which is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched trials in recent memory. The case pits one of the country's biggest media companies against a little-known voting machine manufacturer, and raises major questions about the role of the media in the democratic process.

At the center of the case is a series of claims made by Fox News and its hosts about Dominion's voting machines. Starting soon after the election, Fox News began airing segments and opinion pieces that alleged that Dominion's machines had been manipulated to steal votes from then-President Donald Trump and deliver the election to Joe Biden.

Those claims were repeated over and over again on Fox News, despite being without basis in fact. And they were amplified by other right-wing media outlets and figures, who seized on the claims to spread even more misinformation about the election.

As the weeks and months wore on, Dominion became a byword for election fraud in many Republican circles. Its machines were blamed for everything from flipped votes to dead voters casting ballots. This despite the fact that there was no evidence whatsoever to support those claims.

Now, Dominion is fighting back. The company has filed defamation suits against Fox News, as well as a number of other conservative media outlets and figures. And it has launched a major public relations campaign to clear its name and restore confidence in the integrity of the election.

The stakes in the case are high for both sides. For Dominion, a favorable verdict could help repair some of the massive damage done to its reputation over the past year. It could also set a precedent for other companies and individuals who were similarly targeted by false claims about the election.

For Fox News, a loss could be devastating. The $1.6 billion price tag is unprecedented for a media company, and could force Fox News' parent company, News Corp, to divest assets or even sell off the network. It could also push other media outlets to act more responsibly with their coverage of the election, out of fear of similar legal action.

The trial is taking place in a federal court in Washington, D.C. Judge Royce Lamberth is presiding over the case, and has set aside four weeks for the trial. He has already made it clear that he expects both sides to present all available evidence and arguments, and that he will rule strictly on the merits of the case.

Jury selection began on Monday, and is expected to take several days. The process involves questioning potential jurors about their backgrounds, biases, and knowledge of the case, and selecting a group of 12 individuals who can be impartial and fair in their assessment of the evidence.

The selection of the jury is expected to be a major moment in the trial, as it will give both sides a glimpse into the minds and attitudes of ordinary Americans towards the claims made about Dominion and the election. It will also set the tone for the trial itself, as the jurors will be responsible for determining whether Dominion was indeed defamed by Fox News.

The trial promises to be a tense and contentious affair, as the two sides spar over competing versions of the facts. Dominion will present evidence that its machines worked exactly as they were supposed to, and that there was no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulation in the election. Fox News, in turn, will likely argue that it was simply reporting on a story that was of interest to its viewers, and that it had no intent to defame Dominion.

But the truth of the matter is that Fox News went further than simply reporting on a story. Its hosts and commentators repeatedly made claims that were demonstrably false, and acted as amplifiers for conspiracy theories and disinformation about the election. And while Fox News has since effectively walked back many of those claims, the damage has already been done.

The Dominion case is not just about one company's reputation or one election. It is about the very foundations of our democracy, and the role of the media in that process. If the media is allowed to spread falsehoods and misinformation without consequence, then our democracy is at risk.

The case is also a reminder of the power of the media, and the responsibility that comes with it. Fox News has a massive audience, and what it says can have real-world consequences. If it spreads lies and conspiracy theories, then those lies and theories will be believed by millions of people.

But the media can also be a force for good. It can be a watchdog that holds those in power accountable, and a source of information that helps people make informed decisions. It can help build a better, more democratic society.

The Dominion trial will not be the final word on the role of the media in our democracy. But it will be an important milestone, and a wake-up call to all those who would put politics and profit before truth and responsibility.",1
143,An inside look at Russia's notorious prison where American reporter is being held,"Moscow, Russia - In the heart of Russia's grim penal system lies a prison that is notoriously brutal, where inmates are reportedly subjected to physical and psychological abuse. This is where American journalist, John Smith has been detained since last month on espionage charges.

Black Dolphin, located in the western Ural Mountains, is known as one of Russia's harshest detention centers. The facility houses some of the country's most dangerous and high-profile criminals, including terrorists and serial killers.

The prison's remoteness - it is two hours away from the nearest city - and the harsh weather conditions contribute to the sense of isolation and desolation. According to local media reports, inmates are confined to their cells for up to 22 hours a day and subjected to various forms of torture, including waterboarding.

Reports have also referenced a “punishment cell” where captives are kept in solitary without any contact with the outside world.

As diplomatic efforts continue to secure Smith's release, his family describes the detention conditions as “unacceptable.” The US State Department declined to comment on the treatment of American prisoners in this or any other Russian prison.",1

145,Elon Musk says he's cut about 80% of Twitter's staff,"In a surprising announcement made on Sunday, Elon Musk declared that he had cut about 80% of the staff working for Twitter. The news has sent shockwaves through the tech world and triggered a frenzy of speculation over the reasons behind this unexpected move.

For those who may not be familiar with Elon Musk, he is a billionaire entrepreneur who made his fortune through his involvement in companies such as PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX. He has become known for his ambitious and often unconventional business ventures, as well as his outspoken statements on a range of topics, including the future of artificial intelligence and colonizing Mars.

Musk's latest move, however, has left many scratching their heads. Why would he, a non-Twitter employee, supposedly have the power to lay off the majority of the social media site's staff? And why would he want to do so in the first place?

To understand Musk's motives, it's necessary to go back to a tweet he sent out on Friday, just two days before his announcement. In the tweet, he criticized Twitter's content moderation policies, describing them as ""super dumb."" He went on to say that the company's approach was driving people away and that it was ""going to end up killing itself"" if it didn't change course.

It's not the first time Musk has been critical of Twitter's management. He has long argued that the platform has become a breeding ground for fake news, conspiracy theories, and other harmful content. In fact, he deleted his own Twitter account last June, declaring that the site ""is a war zone.""

So, what exactly did Musk mean by saying he had ""cut"" Twitter's staff? It's unclear whether he meant he had personally taken action to remove employees or was speaking metaphorically. Some have suggested that he may have meant that his criticism had led to a mass exodus of users and advertisers, thus reducing the need for as many staff. Others have speculated that this was simply a ploy to draw attention to his ongoing concerns about the platform.

However it's interpreted, Musk's tweet has sparked a vigorous debate over how social media sites should be moderated. For years, companies like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have struggled to balance the need to give users the freedom to express themselves with the responsibility to prevent harmful or illegal content from spreading.

Twitter has faced particular scrutiny over its handling of misinformation and hate speech. The site has been accused of enabling online harassment, amplifying fake news stories, and allowing extremist groups to recruit and organize. In recent years, the company has taken steps to address these issues, such as hiring more moderators and launching new features to flag problematic content.

But critics argue that these efforts have not been enough. They say that Twitter, like other major tech companies, needs to fundamentally rethink its approach to content moderation. Some have called for tighter regulation or even breaking up companies like Facebook and Twitter, which they view as monopolies that have too much power over the public discourse.

Others, however, have defended Twitter's policies and accused Musk of overreacting. They point out that social media is a complex and constantly evolving landscape, and that no single solution is going to solve all of the problems overnight. They argue that Twitter's staff and management are working hard to balance the competing demands of free expression and responsible content moderation.

Whatever the truth behind Musk's announcement, it is clear that the issue of social media regulation is not going away any time soon. As online platforms become increasingly central to our daily lives, the stakes are higher than ever. The decisions made by companies like Twitter will have a profound impact on our society, politics, and culture for years to come. It remains to be seen whether Musk's criticism will lead to a meaningful change in the industry or just be another blip on the radar.",1
146,Japan to develop long-range missiles as tensions with China rise,"In the midst of rising tensions with China, Japan has announced plans to develop long-range missiles capable of hitting mainland China.

This move has been met with mixed reactions, with some experts applauding Japan for taking steps to defend itself, while others warn of the potential consequences of an arms race in the region.

So what exactly is behind Japan's decision to develop these missiles, and what impact will it have on the already tense relationship between Japan and China?

The roots of Japan's missile development

To understand why Japan is developing long-range missiles, it's important to look at the broader context of its relationship with China.

Tensions between these two Asian powers have been simmering for years, with China's aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea and Japan's resistance to China's expanding influence in the region.

Japan has been particularly alarmed by China's increasing military capabilities, including its development of advanced missile systems, stealth fighters, and aircraft carriers.

To counter these threats, Japan has been steadily increasing its own military capabilities in recent years. In 2015, the Japanese government passed a series of controversial security laws that, among other things, allowed Japan's military to engage in collective self-defense, meaning it could come to the aid of an ally, even if Japan itself was not under attack.

Since then, Japan has been steadily increasing its defense capabilities, including its missile defense systems. However, these systems are primarily designed to intercept incoming missiles, rather than strike at enemy targets.

The development of long-range missiles would represent a significant change in Japan's defense posture and could shift the balance of power in the region.

Japan's current missile capabilities

While Japan is currently limited by its constitution from developing offensive military capabilities, it does possess some missile systems that could be used for defensive purposes.

One such system is the Type-12 surface-to-air missile, which has a range of around 200 kilometers and is designed to intercept incoming missiles.

Japan also possesses the surface-to-ship ASM-3 missile, which has a range of around 200-400 kilometers and is designed to strike enemy ships from a distance.

However, neither of these systems have the range or accuracy needed to strike targets on China's mainland, which is why Japan is now pursuing the development of long-range missiles.

The challenges of missile development

Developing a new missile system is no small feat, and Japan will face several challenges in bringing its long-range missiles to fruition.

First, there are technical challenges involved in designing and building a missile that can travel long distances with a high degree of accuracy. This will require significant investment in research and development, as well as close collaboration with other countries with advanced missile technologies, such as the United States.

Second, Japan will also need to carefully manage its relationship with China, and avoid escalating tensions further. While Japan has a legitimate right to defend itself, any overt moves to increase its military capabilities could be seen as a provocative move by China, potentially leading to a dangerous tit-for-tat arms race.

Finally, there are also political challenges to consider. Japan's pacifist constitution has long been a major factor in shaping the country's defense policy, and any move to develop offensive military capabilities would be highly controversial. Japan will need to carefully balance the need to defend itself with the need to maintain regional stability and avoid alienating its neighbors.

The risks of an arms race

Even if Japan is successful in developing its long-range missile system, there are key risks involved in escalating tensions with China, including the possibility of an arms race in the region.

As both countries invest more in their military capabilities, there is a risk that other countries will be drawn into the fray, potentially leading to a dangerous regional conflict.

Moreover, an arms race could also have economic consequences, with both Japan and China diverting resources away from their domestic priorities in order to fund their military build-up.

There is also the risk that Japan's long-range missiles will be seen as a threat by other countries in the region, including South Korea and Taiwan, potentially leading to a new arms race in the area.

The role of the United States

One key player in this equation is the United States, which has long maintained a strong military presence in the region and has played a key role in maintaining regional stability.

The U.S. has already expressed support for Japan's decision to develop long-range missiles, seeing it as a way to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and counter China's growing military power.

However, there is also the risk that the U.S. could be drawn into any regional conflict that arises as a result of escalating tensions between Japan and China.

Moreover, the U.S. has its own complicated relationship with China, which has been strained in recent years over trade, human rights, and Taiwan.

The U.S. will need to carefully manage its relationships with both China and Japan in order to avoid any further destabilization in the region.

The implications of Japan's decision

Japan's decision to develop long-range missiles has significant implications not only for the security of the region but also for the broader global order.

While Japan has a legitimate right to defend itself, any move to increase its military capabilities risks triggering an arms race in the region, potentially leading to conflict and instability.

Moreover, the United States' support for Japan's missile development could further complicate the already fraught relationship between the U.S. and China, potentially leading to more aggressive actions by both sides.

Ultimately, the key to avoiding a dangerous escalation in tensions is for all sides to focus on diplomacy and dialogue, rather than escalating their military capabilities.

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and interdependent, the risks of conflict are simply too great to ignore.",1
147,Juul to pay $462 million to six states in its largest settlement ever,"Juul to pay $462 million to six states in its largest settlement ever

Juul, the popular e-cigarette company, has agreed to pay $462 million to six states in what is being called its largest settlement ever. The settlement comes after years of accusations that the company targeted teenagers with its marketing and flavored products, leading to a surge in nicotine addiction among young people.

The states involved in the settlement are California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The money will be used to fund programs to prevent youth vaping and to help those who have become addicted.

The settlement also includes significant changes to the way Juul operates, including limiting the sale of flavored products to adults-only stores and ending its social media advertising campaigns. The company will also be required to use age-verification technology on its website and to track its sales data to ensure compliance with the new restrictions.

The agreement, which was announced on Tuesday, is a major victory for public health advocates who have been pushing for tighter regulations on e-cigarettes in recent years. They argue that the devices are a gateway to traditional smoking for young people and that the sweet-flavored products are particularly appealing to children.

Juul, which is based in San Francisco and is majority-owned by the tobacco giant Altria Group, has faced a barrage of lawsuits and regulatory actions in recent years. In addition to the lawsuits from the states involved in the settlement, the company is facing a number of class-action lawsuits from consumers who say they were harmed by the company's products.

The settlement is also likely to have implications for other e-cigarette companies and for the vaping industry as a whole. Regulators and lawmakers have been increasingly scrutinizing e-cigarettes in recent years, and this settlement is likely to add momentum to their efforts.

In a statement, Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite said that the company is committed to ""earning the trust of society"" and that the settlement is an important step in that direction.

""We must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers,"" Crosthwaite said.

The settlement comes amid growing concerns about the impact of e-cigarettes on young people. According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 5.3 million young people in the United States are currently using e-cigarettes, and many of them are using flavored products.

The CDC has also reported a spike in lung injuries associated with vaping, with more than 2,800 cases and 68 deaths reported as of February 2020. The injuries are believed to be caused by a chemical called vitamin E acetate, which is often added to black-market THC vaping products.

The settlement with the six states is likely to have a major impact on Juul's bottom line. The company has already been struggling financially, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only added to its woes. The pandemic has led to a decline in sales and a shift in consumer behavior away from e-cigarettes and toward traditional cigarettes and other nicotine products.

According to a report by Bloomberg, Juul's revenue has declined from $2 billion in 2018 to around $1.2 billion in 2019. The company has also faced significant regulatory hurdles in recent years, including a ban on flavored products in several states and a federal ban on certain e-cigarette flavors.

The settlement is likely to be a major blow to Juul's reputation as well. The company has long been criticized for its aggressive marketing tactics and its use of influencers and social media to promote its products to young people.

In 2018, the company was valued at $38 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups in the world. However, its valuation has steadily declined in the wake of the regulatory crackdown and the increasing public scrutiny of e-cigarettes.

The settlement with the six states is just the latest in a series of legal and regulatory actions against Juul and other e-cigarette companies. In 2019, the federal government raised the legal age for purchasing tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to 21. And in March of this year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter to Juul over its marketing practices.

Despite these setbacks, e-cigarettes continue to be popular among young people. According to a study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, nearly 40 percent of high school seniors reported using an e-cigarette at least once in 2019.

The settlement with the six states is likely to have a major impact on the vaping industry as a whole. It sends a strong message to other companies that they will be held accountable for their marketing practices and that they must take steps to prevent young people from using their products.

It also underscores the growing recognition among lawmakers and public health experts that e-cigarettes are not a safe alternative to traditional smoking, especially for young people. While e-cigarettes may be less harmful than traditional cigarettes, they still contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance that can have long-term health consequences, including an increased risk for heart disease and stroke.

In light of these risks, public health experts are calling for stronger regulations on e-cigarettes and for greater efforts to prevent young people from using them. They argue that e-cigarettes should be subject to the same strict regulatory framework as traditional cigarettes, including restrictions on advertising and sales to minors.

The settlement with Juul is an important step in this direction, but there is still much work to be done. Until e-cigarettes are subject to the same level of scrutiny and regulation as traditional cigarettes, they will continue to pose a serious threat to public health, especially among young people.",1

Spring has sprung and many people are turning to their gardens as a way to unwind, destress and stay active. Not only is gardening a popular hobby, it is also a form of exercise that can burn calories, build muscle and boost mental health.

In fact, gardening has been seen as a staple activity in many cultures for centuries. From growing food to creating beautiful landscapes, gardening has evolved into a therapeutic activity that can be used to improve physical and emotional wellbeing.

Gardening And Physical Health

The physical benefits of gardening are numerous. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gardening can be considered a moderate-intensity exercise that can improve cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure, improve flexibility and balance, and even reduce the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Digging, planting, weeding and pruning can be considered low-impact exercises but they can still be considered a form of resistance training. Digging soil can be considered a form of weight lifting that targets the arms, shoulders, back and abdominal muscles. The bending and squatting required to plant seeds or pull weeds can also help to tone the lower body.

A study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that gardeners who dig and plant were able to burn up to 300 calories in just 30 minutes. This is comparable to moderate-intensity exercise such as cycling or brisk walking.

Gardening And Mental Health

Gardening has also been linked to improved mental health. A study published in the Journal of Health Psychology found that gardening can be used to reduce stress and anxiety. The study found that just 30 minutes of gardening can produce a measurable reduction in the stress hormone cortisol.

Additionally, gardening provides a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that can improve self-esteem and confidence. The act of creating and nurturing something can help to combat depression and feelings of loneliness.

For people who suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), gardening can also provide much-needed exposure to sunlight. Sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D which can help to regulate mood, improve bone health and reduce the risk of certain cancers.

Gardening And The Environment

Gardening can also have a positive impact on the environment. Growing your own food can reduce the carbon footprint required to transport and package produce. It can also reduce waste and increase access to fresh, healthy foods.

Additionally, gardens can serve as a habitat for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This can help to support local ecosystems and reduce the use of harmful pesticides.

Gardening Tips For Beginners

If you're new to gardening, starting small is key. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Consider the space you have available

If you live in an apartment, you can start with container gardening. If you have a small backyard, you can start with a few potted plants or a raised bed garden. It's important to assess your space and choose what works best for you.

2. Choose the right plants

When choosing plants, consider the climate and amount of sun exposure in your area. Look for plants that are appropriate for your zone and are compatible with the amount of sunlight available. It's also important to choose plants that are easy to care for and beginner-friendly.

3. Start simple

Don't be too ambitious in the beginning. Start with a few plants and gradually work your way up. Focus on maintaining healthy plants before adding more to your collection.

4. Invest in good tools

A good set of gardening tools can make all the difference. Invest in a quality shovel, rake, and pruning shears. These tools will make gardening easier and more efficient.

5. Enjoy the process

Gardening is a process, not a destination. Take time to enjoy the peace and tranquility that gardening can bring. Don't get too caught up in the end result, but focus on the journey.

Final Thoughts

Gardening is a fun and rewarding activity that can improve physical and mental wellbeing. From growing food to creating beautiful flower beds, gardening can be tailored to match individual preferences and needs. As a form of exercise, gardening can help to reduce the risk of common chronic diseases and improve overall health. So, ditch the weights and endless hours on the treadmill and get outside and enjoy the benefits of gardening.",1
149,"Zelensky condemns ""beasts"" for alleged beheadings","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky strongly condemned the recent allegations of beheadings by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. In a statement on Wednesday, Zelensky described the perpetrators as ""beasts"" and said they ""have no place in a civilized society"".

The allegations of beheadings surfaced after a video was released online, allegedly showing pro-Russian separatists severing the head of a Ukrainian soldier. The incident has sparked outrage and condemnation both within Ukraine and internationally.

Zelensky called for an immediate investigation into the matter and vowed that those responsible for such brutal acts will be held accountable. He also called on the international community to join in condemning such acts of violence.

The conflict in eastern Ukraine has been ongoing since 2014, when pro-Russian separatists seized control of several areas in the region. Despite several ceasefires, the conflict continues to claim lives on both sides of the divide.

Zelensky's condemnation of the recent allegations underscores the urgent need for a lasting resolution to this bloody conflict.",1
150,Indian journalists warn of new government assault on press freedom,"Indian journalists warn of new government assault on press freedom

Indian journalists have been warning of a renewed government assault on press freedom, as India's increasingly authoritarian regime seeks to clamp down on critical voices in the media.

While press freedom has always been a fragile concept in India, recent years have seen a marked increase in government repression of journalists who dare to dissent or criticize the government. This has included arrests, harassment and intimidation of journalists, as well as attempts to silence them by imposing legal penalties, such as fines or imprisonment.

The latest round of attacks on the media began in late 2020, when the government introduced new rules requiring online news platforms to register with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, giving the government unprecedented control over online news content.

This move was seen by many as an attempt to stifle critical reporting by forcing online news outlets to comply with government regulations, which could require them to censor stories or even shut down their operations altogether.

Journalists have also been targeted by the government through the use of draconian laws such as the sedition law, which criminalizes speech that is seen as seditious or against the state. This law has been used by the government to arrest and charge journalists who have reported on issues deemed critical of the government.

One such journalist is Siddique Kappan, who was arrested in October 2020 while reporting on the Hathras gang rape case, which had attracted international attention for the brutal gang rape and murder of a young Dalit woman. Kappan was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a notoriously harsh anti-terrorism law that allows authorities to keep detainees in custody for up to six months without charge.

Kappan's case is just one of many examples of journalists being targeted for reporting on sensitive issues that the government would rather keep under wraps. Another is the case of journalist Vinod Dua, who was charged with sedition in 2020 for criticizing the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The impact of these attacks on press freedom has been widespread and far-reaching. Journalists who dare to speak out against the government risk being branded as ""anti-national"" or ""anti-state"", and risk losing their jobs, their reputations, and even their lives.

According to Reporters Without Borders, India is ranked 142nd out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, down two places from its 2020 ranking. The organization notes that ""attacks against journalists by supporters of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) increased in the run-up to the 2019 general elections.""

In response to these attacks on press freedom, journalists in India have been organizing to defend their rights and to push back against the government's efforts to silence them. This has included protests, strikes, and calls for international solidarity and support.

One such organization is the Editors Guild of India, which has been outspoken in its defense of press freedom and in its criticism of the government's attempts to stifle dissenting voices in the media.

In a statement released in February 2021, the Guild said: ""Over the past few years, the Indian media has faced an unprecedented assault on its freedom and independence. Governments and political parties across the spectrum have sought to control and manipulate the media, often resorting to coercion and intimidation to silence dissent.""

Despite these efforts, however, the government's assault on press freedom shows no signs of abating. Instead, it appears to be intensifying, as the government seeks to consolidate its power and to silence any voices that might challenge its authority.

This is a worrying trend for India, which has long prided itself on its vibrant and pluralistic media culture. In recent years, however, that culture has come under attack from a government that seems intent on silencing critical voices and promoting its own propaganda.

As India enters a new phase of its democratic journey, it is important that the media continues to play its crucial role as a watchdog and a voice for the people. This will require journalists and media organizations to remain vigilant and to continue to speak truth to power, even in the face of increasing repression and intimidation.

At a time when the world is grappling with a pandemic and its myriad consequences, it is more important than ever that the media is able to function freely and independently, holding governments and other powerful actors to account and ensuring that the public remains informed and engaged.

If the government chooses to continue its assault on press freedom, it risks undermining India's democracy and its standing in the world, and depriving its citizens of a crucial tool for holding their elected officials accountable.",1
151,Shania Twain wants more diversity in country music. Here's who she's talking about,"It's no secret that country music has a long history of being predominantly white and male-dominated. And while there have been some efforts to diversify the genre in recent years, there's still a long way to go.

Enter Shania Twain, who is calling for more diversity in country music. The Canadian singer-songwriter, who rose to fame in the mid-90s with hits like ""Man! I Feel Like a Woman!"" and ""That Don't Impress Me Much,"" has always been something of an outlier in the country music world. Her music blends country with pop and rock, and her image is more glam than down-home.

But despite not fitting the traditional mold of a country artist, Twain has become one of the genre's biggest stars, selling over 100 million records worldwide and earning five Grammy Awards. And now, she's using her platform to advocate for more diversity.

In a recent interview with The Guardian, Twain spoke about her experiences in the industry and her desire to see more people from different backgrounds represented in the genre.

""I want to encourage more diversity, because it's such a beautiful genre of music and it should be inclusive,"" she said. ""And it's so important to represent what the real world looks like, too.""

So who is Twain talking about when she calls for more diversity in country music? Here's a look at some of the artists and communities she'd like to see represented more in the genre.

Women

Perhaps the most obvious group Twain is advocating for is women. Despite the fact that female artists have been a part of country music since its early days, they continue to face significant barriers in the industry.

In recent years, several high-profile female artists have spoken out about the challenges they've faced in the country music world. Singer-songwriter Kacey Musgraves, who won Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammy Awards for her album ""Golden Hour,"" has been vocal about the lack of representation for women in the genre.

""Even female songwriters and artists that have had success in their career are very, very rarely allowed to be the protagonist in country music,"" Musgraves told NPR in 2019. ""They're usually the subject matter, and that has to change.""

Similarly, singer-songwriter Maren Morris, who won a Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance in 2019, has spoken out about the sexism and lack of diversity in the industry. In a 2019 interview with Glamour, she talked about her frustration with the industry's insistence on pigeonholing female artists into certain categories.

""I think it’s a really stupid, arbitrary thing to do, just because I’m not going to be placed in a box, certainly not just because of the way I look,"" Morris said. ""I think if there’s anything that sets me apart, it’s that I am a bit of a chameleon.""

Twain herself has been no stranger to the challenges faced by women in country music. In a 2019 interview with Entertainment Weekly, she talked about the struggles she encountered early in her career, when people in the industry told her that her music was ""too pop"" and wouldn't be successful.

""It wasn't until I broke through that barrier that people started to say, 'Oh, there might be something to this pop-country thing,'"" Twain said.

But even after achieving success, Twain has faced criticism for her image and music. In a 1998 interview with Playboy, she talked about being called a ""sellout"" and a ""slut"" by some in the industry.

""Nobody can deny that I'm an artist in my own right,"" Twain said in the interview. ""I write, I sing, I perform, and that's not easy. Even if people didn't respect my music, they'd have to respect me as a person for that, because it's a hard thing to do.""

Twain's experiences highlight the need for more representation and inclusivity for women in country music. As Musgraves noted, female artists should be allowed to be the protagonists in their own songs, rather than just serving as the object of a male artist's affection.

People of color

While women are perhaps the most visibly underrepresented group in country music, people of color are also a significant minority in the genre. Historically, country music has been strongly associated with white rural America, and it hasn't always been welcoming to artists of color.

That's slowly starting to change, thanks in part to artists like Darius Rucker and Kane Brown, who have achieved success in the genre despite facing some resistance from traditionalists. Rucker, who was the lead singer of Hootie and the Blowfish before launching a solo country career in the 2000s, has won several awards and had multiple number one hits on the country charts. Brown, a biracial artist from Georgia, has also had significant success, with five number one hits to his name.

But while Rucker and Brown have certainly made inroads, the fact remains that people of color are still vastly underrepresented in country music. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Brown talked about the challenges he's faced as a black artist in the genre.

""I've definitely gotten some hate online, but I almost expected that,"" Brown said. ""I've always been hearing, 'You're not country enough,' 'You're too pop,' and all this stuff.""

Twain has also spoken about the need for more diversity in country music, noting in a 2019 interview with The Independent that it's a ""mainstream"" genre that should be ""representative of a broader audience."" She pointed out that the genre's roots in black music, such as blues and gospel, have been largely forgotten.

""I think it's important to honour that part of the tradition and not whiten it out,"" Twain said.

Twain isn't the only artist calling for more diversity in country music. In 2020, a group of black country artists formed the collective Country Music Association (CMA) Equity, which aims to promote and support diversity in the genre. The group includes artists like Rissi Palmer, Mickey Guyton, and Brittney Spencer, who have all faced significant barriers as black women in country music.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Palmer talked about the challenges of breaking into the genre as a black artist.

""Country music has always been at the bottom of the list as far as opportunities,"" Palmer said. ""There's always been a ceiling for Black artists in country music. We're always seen as too R&B or too pop. There's always an excuse to say no.""

LGBTQ+ artists

Another group that has historically been underrepresented in country music is the LGBTQ+ community. Like with people of color, country music has tended to be associated with more conservative values, and it hasn't always been welcoming to LGBTQ+ artists and fans.

But that, too, is starting to change. In recent years, several openly LGBTQ+ artists have emerged in the genre, including Brandi Carlile, Brandy Clark, and Orville Peck.

Carlile, who is openly gay, has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in country music. She was recently involved in a controversy when a radio station in Boise, Idaho, pulled her music from its playlist after she spoke out in support of LGBTQ+ rights. The station later reversed its decision and apologized.

Clark, who is openly lesbian, has also been outspoken about the need for more representation in the genre. In a 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, she talked about the hypocrisy of a genre that celebrates ""every kind of love except gay love.""

Peck, who is openly gay and wears a mask as part of his image, has been hailed as a rising star in country music. In a 2020 interview with The Guardian, he talked about using his music to break down stereotypes about what a country artist should look like.

""I think it takes a lot of courage to stand up and say you’re going to be the first something,"" Peck said. ""I just decided I would be the first masked man in country music.""

It's worth noting that LGBTQ+ representation in country music isn't just about the artists themselves. It's also about creating spaces where LGBTQ+ fans feel welcome and accepted. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Clark talked about the importance of country music festivals being inclusive of all fans.

""It should be a place that's inclusive of all different kinds of people,"" Clark said. ""That's what it's always been about for me, and I think that's what it should always be about.""

People with disabilities

One group that is often overlooked in discussions of diversity in country music is people with disabilities. But like with other groups, there have been some artists who have broken through in the genre despite facing significant challenges.

One such artist is Drake White, a country singer-songwriter who has been open about his debilitating medical condition. White suffers from arteriovenous malformation, a disorder that affects the blood vessels in his brain and can cause seizures, balance problems, and other issues.

In a 2019 interview with People, White talked about the challenges of being a performer with a disability.

""It's like hiding a bomb that can go off at any time,"" he said. ""It's a strange phenomenon. You never know when it's going to happen or in what way it's going to present itself.""

But despite these challenges, White has continued to pursue his passion for music, and he's even used his platform to raise awareness about his condition and advocate for others with disabilities.

Another artist with a disability who has achieved success in country music is Ronnie Milsap, a blind singer-songwriter who won six Grammy Awards and had multiple number one hits in the 1970s and 80s. Milsap's success is especially notable given the physical and logistical challenges he faced as a blind performer.

While there are undoubtedly other artists with disabilities in country music, the fact remains that they are often underrepresented and overlooked in discussions of diversity.

Breaking down barriers

There's no denying that country music has come a long way in terms of diversity in recent years. But as Twain and other artists have pointed out, there's still work to be done.

It's worth noting that diversity in country music isn't just about representation for its own sake. It's also about breaking down barriers and challenging stereotypes about what a country artist should look and sound like.

As Clark noted in her Rolling Stone interview, ""I think people should be free to make country music and wear whatever the hell they want, and love whoever the hell they want to love.""

Ultimately, as Twain said in her interview with The Guardian, it's about making country music a genre that truly represents the world we live in.

""I don't like the divide that's perceived between country music and other genres,"" she said. ""I don't think that divide should exist. We should be united in all forms of music, and embrace diversity in all forms of music.""",1
152,What we know about the victims of the bank shooting in Louisville,"What we know about the victims of the bank shooting in Louisville

On September 6th, 2018, five victims were tragically killed during a shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky. The incident has shocked the community and the nation as a whole. Every victim had a name, a family, and a life before their untimely death. In this article, we aim to humanize and honor the five individuals who lost their lives. 

Terry Majors

Terry Majors was a 61-year-old employee at the bank where the shooting occurred. He had worked there for over a decade and was described as a kind and well-liked colleague by his coworkers. One of his coworkers, Kaleb Parker, said, “He always had a smile on his face, and he made the work environment feel like home.”

Majors’ son, Kameron, spoke to the media about his father’s death. “My dad was a great man. He was very loving, very caring,” he said. “He never met a stranger. He would always go out of his way to help anyone. He was very kind-hearted and caring.”

She was a devoted wife, mother, and friend, and she will be deeply missed.”

Cornett’s children, Michael and Aaron, also spoke out about their mother’s death. “Our mother was the most loving and caring person in the world,” they said. “She always put others before herself and had a heart of gold. We will miss her more than words can say.”

Angelica French

Angelica French was a 35-year-old employee at the bank. She had been working there for just a few months before the shooting. Her coworkers described her as a hard worker who was always willing to lend a hand.

French was also a mother of two children, a 5-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son. Her family and friends remember her as a devoted mother who loved spending time with her children.

French’s sister, Evelyn Williams, shared a message with the media about her sister’s death. “Angelica was a beautiful person inside and out,” she said. “She had a heart of gold and was always willing to help anyone in need. We will forever miss her and hold her close in our hearts.”

153,France braces for a 12th day of nationwide protests,"France is preparing for a 12th day of protests, as the Yellow Vest movement continues to make its voice heard across the country. While initial protests centered on a proposed fuel tax hike, the movement has since morphed into a broader expression of frustration with economic inequality, government policies, and the elite class.

Over the past two weeks, protesters have clashed with police, vandalized buildings, and blocked major highways and thoroughfares. This has prompted the government to deploy thousands of police officers, set up barricades, and close popular tourist sites such as the Eiffel Tower.

Despite these measures, the protests have continued, with thousands of people taking to the streets in Paris and other cities. The government has tried to appease the protesters by announcing a suspension of the fuel tax hike and unveiling other economic concessions, but these measures have not been enough to quell the outrage.

Now, as the country braces for another day of protests, there are concerns about the potential for violence and further disruptions to daily life. The government has urged citizens to stay calm and avoid conflict, but it remains to be seen whether these appeals will be heeded.

As the crisis drags on, it is clear that France is facing a significant social and political upheaval, one that could have far-reaching consequences for the country's future.",1
154,FDA approves first over-the-counter version of opioid overdose antidote Narcan,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first-ever over-the-counter version of the opioid overdose antidote Narcan. This is a significant step towards tackling the nation's opioid epidemic.

Narcan, also known by its generic name, naloxone, is a medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. It works by blocking the opioid receptors in the brain and restoring normal respiration. The drug is typically administered via injection or nasal spray.

Traditionally, naloxone has only been available with a prescription from a healthcare professional. However, with the new FDA approval, consumers will be able to purchase Narcan without a prescription directly from their local pharmacy.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, said in a statement, ""Having naloxone available over-the-counter is a critical component of our efforts to reduce overdose deaths and save lives.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 47,000 people died from opioid overdoses in the U.S. in 2017, a number that continues to rise. Making naloxone more widely available has been identified as a key strategy in reducing this figure.

The move to make Narcan an over-the-counter medication has been met with mixed reactions from experts.

Some have praised the decision, arguing that it will help to reduce barriers to access and save lives. Dr. Kelly Clark, president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, said in a statement, ""This is a tremendous move forward in the fight against the opioid epidemic.""

Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and Management, echoed this sentiment. He told CNN in an interview, ""The approval of an over-the-counter version of Narcan is an important step forward in the fight against the opioid epidemic. It will help to increase access to this lifesaving medication.""

Others, however, have expressed concerns about the potential risks of making Narcan more widely available. Some worry that it could give people a false sense of security, leading them to take larger doses of opioids or engage in riskier drug use behavior.

Dr. Leana Wen, the president of Planned Parenthood and a former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, wrote in an op-ed for The Washington Post, ""The problem is that naloxone has been oversold as a cure-all for the opioid crisis. It's not. We need to make sure that we're not sending the message that all we need is naloxone.""

There have also been concerns about the cost of Narcan, which can be prohibitively expensive for some consumers. However, many public health advocates have pointed out that having an over-the-counter version of the drug could help to make it more affordable.

In addition to the over-the-counter approval, the FDA has also issued new guidelines for the packaging of the medication. The agency is recommending that Narcan be sold in a ""carton or other packaging"" that includes instructions for use and a diagram or illustration of how to administer the drug.

The FDA is also encouraging pharmacists to provide education and counseling to those who purchase Narcan, including information about the signs of an opioid overdose and how to administer the medication correctly.

The move to make Narcan an over-the-counter medication could have a significant impact on the opioid epidemic, but it is not a panacea. Experts stress that it is just one piece of a larger puzzle that includes efforts to address the root causes of addiction and to provide comprehensive treatment and support to those struggling with opioid use disorder.

""The opioid epidemic is complex, and there are no easy solutions,"" said Dr. Clark. ""We need to continue to work together to address this crisis from every angle.""

In addition to making Narcan more widely available, there are several other strategies that have been proposed to address the opioid epidemic. These include:

- Expanding access to addiction treatment and recovery support services, including medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and behavioral therapies.

- Providing funding for research and development of alternative pain management options, such as non-opioid medications and integrative therapies.

- Implementing harm reduction strategies, such as safe injection sites and needle exchange programs, to reduce the spread of infectious diseases and overdoses.

- Addressing the social determinants of health that contribute to substance use, such as poverty, trauma, and lack of access to healthcare.

By taking a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to the opioid epidemic, we can begin to make real progress in reducing overdose deaths and improving the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities affected by this crisis.

The approval of an over-the-counter version of Narcan is a positive step in the right direction, but there is much more work to be done. We must remain committed to finding effective and sustainable solutions that prioritize the health and safety of all individuals.",1
155,"This California city's newest police recruit, ""Officer Hops,"" is a therapy bunny","OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA - The city of Oakland has made headlines with its newest addition to the police department: Officer Hops, the therapy bunny. This unique approach to law enforcement has captured the attention of residents and media worldwide.

Officer Hops, a gray and white Holland Lop rabbit, was sworn in on Monday and has already made a positive impact on the police force and the community alike. While the idea of a therapy bunny patrolling the streets may seem unconventional, it's not unprecedented. In fact, several police departments across the country have implemented animal-assisted therapy programs and have experienced positive results.

Officer Hops' handler, Taylor Bailey, is a licensed clinical social worker and animal-assisted therapist. Bailey, who also happens to be the founder of the animal therapy nonprofit ""The Little Ark,"" had been visiting the Oakland Police Department for several months to provide animal-assisted therapy sessions to officers. During her visits, Officer Hops became an instant hit, and it wasn't long before the idea of having a therapy bunny on the force became a reality.

Bailey trained Officer Hops for several months before bringing her on board. The training included getting the bunny comfortable with wearing a police vest, riding in a police car, and even getting accustomed to walking on a leash. Bailey says that Officer Hops took to the training quickly and has shown a natural ability to provide comfort to those around her.

""When people see Officer Hops, their eyes light up,"" Bailey says. ""She has a calming presence, and people just can't help but smile when they see her. It's a reminder that police officers are here to help and that we're all in this together.""

The Oakland Police Department has been facing criticism following several incidents of police brutality, and Officer Hops is seen as a step towards healing the relationship between the police and the community.

""I think having Officer Hops on the force will help to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the people they serve,"" says community activist and Oakland resident, Julia Nguyen. ""It's a creative and innovative approach to policing, and I think it shows that the department is willing to try new things.""

Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong agrees that Officer Hops is a positive addition to the department. ""We understand that the community is hurting, and we're working to build trust and make positive changes,"" Armstrong says. ""Officer Hops is a symbol of that commitment to change.""

Officer Hops will not be out on patrol or responding to emergency calls, but she will be accompanying Bailey on visits to schools, community centers, and other locations where her presence can provide comfort and support.

Animal-assisted therapy programs have been proven effective in a variety of settings, including hospitals, hospices, and schools. Studies have shown that spending time with animals can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and increase feelings of happiness and well-being.

""It's amazing what animals can do for people,"" Bailey says. ""They offer a sense of comfort and validation that can be hard to find elsewhere. Officer Hops is just one animal, but she's making a big impact.""

The reaction to Officer Hops has been overwhelmingly positive, with many people taking to social media to express their support for the therapy bunny.

""Officer Hops is just the cutest thing ever,"" tweeted one user. ""I love seeing police departments embrace more positive approaches to policing.""

Another user tweeted, ""I've always been afraid of police officers, but seeing Officer Hops makes me feel better. Maybe someday, I can talk to a real officer without being scared.""

While Officer Hops may be the first therapy bunny to join a police department, she's not the first animal. Several police departments across the country have implemented animal-assisted therapy programs, including dogs and even miniature horses.

The city of Oakland hopes that Officer Hops will inspire other police departments to explore the benefits of animal-assisted therapy programs and that she will continue to be a positive presence in the community for years to come.

Overall, it's clear that Officer Hops is more than just a cute addition to the department. She represents a new approach to policing, one that focuses on compassion and healing. As Bailey puts it, ""Officer Hops reminds us that even in our darkest moments, there is always hope for something better.""",1
156,Warner Bros. Discovery reengineers the traditional TV bundle for the streaming era,"In the streaming world, there’s no doubt that consumers love having the option to choose from a variety of content, rather than the traditional TV bundle with channels they may never watch. Warner Bros. Discovery is taking this to the next level with their newly announced streaming service, which seeks to reengineer the traditional TV bundle for the streaming era.

Warner Bros. Discovery is the result of a merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery Inc., two media giants that bring together a massive library of content. The new streaming service, set to launch in 2022, is expected to have an enormous selection of shows and movies, along with a range of new features and options for users.

One of the standout features of the service will be the ability to pick and choose different channels, much like a traditional cable TV package. Consumers will be able to select which channels or networks they want to include in their personal lineup, rather than simply having access to a vast library of content. This approach allows consumers to tailor their experience, as they can prioritize the channels they actually enjoy watching.

But the customizable package is just the tip of the iceberg. The service will be designed around discovery and personalization, using AI and machine learning to recommend content that suits each individual user. Warner Bros. Discovery is calling this approach “super-serving,” where the service aims to understand each user’s unique interests and preferences, offering tailored recommendations that go beyond general genre categories.

The service will have a “unified” interface, meaning all shows, movies, and live events will be found in one place, regardless of what network or channel they were originally aired on. This avoids users having to switch between different apps or services to find different content, simplifying the viewing experience.

As well as providing access to new movies and TV shows, the service will also have a range of live programming options, including news, sports, and events. This move into live programming is an important one, as it puts the service in competition with traditional cable TV providers, who still hold a monopoly on live events in many instances. Warner Bros. Discovery’s offering of live events raises the question of whether or not other streaming services will start to move in this direction as well.

The service will include a variety of features that seek to “gamify” the streaming experience. Users will be able to earn points and track progress, unlocking badges and gaining access to exclusive content as they go. The service will feature “custom playlists” that offer curated collections of content based on different themes or moods. For instance, a viewer could create a playlist for “Best Feel Good Movies” or “The Best 80's Action Movies,” and have a personalized list of content based on their preferences.

Another key feature that Warner Bros. Discovery is emphasizing is the ability for families to curate content together, with parental controls that allow for content to be restricted by age range or specific shows or movies. This makes the service more family-friendly, with a greater emphasis on shared viewing experiences.

Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav has stated that the new streaming service will be a “global platform,” with plans to grow beyond just the US market. This puts the service in direct competition with giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, who both have a large presence in multiple countries around the world.

The merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery is aimed at creating a media giant that can compete with other major players in the industry, like Disney and Netflix. By combining their resources, the two companies hope to build a service that offers a vast array of content and capabilities that go above and beyond what’s available from competing services. Warner Bros. Discovery’s reengineering of the traditional TV bundle represents a significant shift in the streaming landscape, one that other providers may soon be forced to follow.

When asked about concerns regarding the merger, Zaslav responded, “We are not Netflix, we’re not Disney. Our job is to super-serve the most passionate fans in the world, and we think we can do that better than anyone else.”

The announcement of Warner Bros. Discovery’s upcoming streaming service has generated a lot of buzz in the media industry. The new features and capabilities that the service promises to offer speak to the changing landscape of the streaming world, with a move away from the all-inclusive bundle and towards a more personalized viewing experience. While it’s still too early to say whether or not the service will be a success, it’s clear that Warner Bros. Discovery is aiming high, with plans to create a one-stop shop for all things entertainment.",1
157,One iguana's taste for cake leaves a young girl with a mysterious malady,"One iguana's taste for cake leaves a young girl with a mysterious malady

It started with a birthday cake, but it ended with a mysterious malady that has stumped doctors and intrigued scientists.

Violet, a five-year-old girl from Florida, had asked for a cake themed after her favourite animal, the iguana. Her mother, Susan, obliged and ordered a brightly coloured iguana-themed cake from a local bakery.

Violet was thrilled with her cake and couldn't wait to have a slice. But as she was about to take her first bite, the family's pet iguana, Spike, darted out of his enclosure and snatched the slice of cake off the plate with his long tongue.

Violet was disappointed, but Susan thought it was funny and took a video of the incident to show her friends. The family didn't think much of it until a few days later, when Violet started experiencing strange symptoms.

It began with a rash on her arm, which Susan assumed was an allergic reaction to some new detergent she had used. But then Violet started complaining of joint pain and fatigue, and the rash spread all over her body.

Susan took Violet to the pediatrician, who prescribed some antihistamines and advised her to keep an eye on the rash. But over the next few days, Violet's symptoms worsened.

She developed a high fever and started experiencing seizures. Susan took her to the emergency room, where doctors ran a battery of tests but couldn't figure out what was wrong.

It wasn't until a chance encounter with a herpetologist (a scientist who studies reptiles and amphibians) that Susan began to suspect that Spike, their pet iguana, might be involved.

The herpetologist, Dr. John Klicka, had been following news reports of the mysterious malady that had struck Violet, and he had a hunch that Spike might be the culprit.

Dr. Klicka had been studying iguanas for years and knew that some species have a fondness for sweets. He theorized that Spike might have ingested something in the cake that was toxic to humans.

Susan was skeptical at first, but she decided to take Spike to a veterinarian to be tested for any toxins that might be harmful to humans.

The results were shocking. Spike had high levels of a toxin called theophylline in his system, which can cause seizures and other neurological symptoms in humans.

Further investigation revealed that theophylline is commonly found in chocolate, which had been used to decorate the iguana cake. It turns out that chocolate is highly toxic to reptiles, and Spike had likely ingested enough of it to make him sick.

But how did the theophylline in Spike's system end up causing a mysterious malady in Violet? Dr. Klicka suspected that Spike's saliva, which had come into contact with the cake, might have somehow altered the theophylline in a way that made it more toxic to humans.

The theory was unconventional and untested, but it was enough to pique the interest of other researchers.

A team of scientists from a nearby university heard about Violet's case and offered to study the effects of iguana saliva on theophylline. They conducted a series of experiments in the lab, and the results were startling.

It turns out that iguana saliva contains enzymes that can break down theophylline and convert it into a form that is more readily absorbed by the body. In other words, Spike's saliva might have turned the theophylline in the chocolate into a more potent form that was more easily absorbed by Violet's body.

The researchers published their findings in a scientific journal, and the case of Violet and Spike became a hot topic in the medical community.

The case raised a number of questions about the potential danger of keeping exotic pets and about the need for more research into the toxicity of common household items.

It also highlighted the importance of collaboration between different fields of science, as it was Dr. Klicka's hunch that ultimately led to the discovery of the potential danger of iguana saliva.

As for Violet, she made a full recovery after being treated for theophylline poisoning. Her family no longer keeps Spike as a pet and has started advocating for more responsible pet ownership and greater awareness of the potential dangers of exotic pets.

The case of Violet and Spike serves as a cautionary tale for those who might underestimate the potential dangers of seemingly harmless household items. It also reminds us of the power of scientific inquiry and the importance of collaboration across disciplines.",1

159,Silicon Valley Bank collapse renews calls to address disparities impacting entrepreneurs of color,"In the midst of a pandemic that has upended industries and livelihoods around the world, the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has sounded alarm bells for an issue that has long plagued the tech industry: the lack of diversity and inclusion when it comes to entrepreneurship.

For those unfamiliar with SVB, it was a prominent lender for startups in the tech industry, providing crucial financing and resources for companies to get off the ground. Hispanic Heritage Foundation CEO Antonio Tijerino described it as “one of the most critical providers of credit and support” for entrepreneurs.

However, in April 2020, SVB announced that it would be closing its Early Stage Practice, a division that provided loans to early-stage startups. While the decision was made in part due to the economic impact of the pandemic, it also highlighted a deeper issue that has been brewing for years.

The lack of access to funding and resources for entrepreneurs of color, particularly Black and Latinx founders, has been well-documented. In 2019, a study by DigitalUndivided found that women of color received just 0.2% of venture capital funding, while a report from RateMyInvestor found that Black and Latinx founders received just 2.4% of total venture capital dollars in 2018.

This disparity has real-world consequences. Without funding, many entrepreneurs are unable to bring their ideas to fruition, and even those who do manage to get off the ground often struggle to compete with their better-funded counterparts.

The collapse of SVB has underscored the need for a more comprehensive approach to addressing this issue. While there are efforts underway to provide more funding and resources for underrepresented entrepreneurs, many advocates say that these initiatives are not enough.

“The societal and economic costs of failing to address this issue are too high,” said Hank Williams, CEO of platform-as-a-service company Platform. “We need to be doing more to support diverse entrepreneurs, not less.”

One of the main challenges facing underrepresented entrepreneurs is the lack of access to networks and resources. Many investors and other key figures in the tech industry are white and male, making it difficult for entrepreneurs of color to build relationships and get their foot in the door.

“We need more people in positions of power who understand the unique challenges facing underrepresented entrepreneurs,” said Charles Hudson, founder of venture capital firm Precursor Ventures. “If we don’t have more diverse voices at the table, we’re going to continue to see these disparities persist.”

Another issue is the unconscious biases that can impact investors’ decision-making. Research has shown that investors are more likely to invest in people who look like them, meaning that entrepreneurs of color may be at a disadvantage simply because of their race or ethnicity.

“We need to be more intentional about addressing these biases,” said Jennifer Pahlka, founder of the Code for America civic tech organization. “That means diversifying our networks, checking our assumptions, and rejecting the idea that there’s a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to entrepreneurship.”

Efforts are underway to address these challenges. Some venture capital firms have launched initiatives to fund underrepresented entrepreneurs, while others are working to diversify their own teams in order to better understand the needs of diverse founders.

There are also organizations like the National Black MBA Association and the Latino Startup Alliance, which provide resources and support to entrepreneurs of color.

Still, many advocates say that these efforts fall short of what is needed. Some are calling for more structural changes, such as the establishment of a federal fund to support underrepresented entrepreneurs, or the use of tax incentives to encourage investment in diverse founders.

“Ultimately, we need a fundamental shift in the way we think about entrepreneurship and innovation,” said Laura Weidman Powers, founder and CEO of Code2040, a nonprofit that works to advance racial equity in the tech industry. “We need to recognize that the current system is not working for everyone, and that we need to do more to create an inclusive, equitable ecosystem for all entrepreneurs.”

There are signs of progress. The recent Black Lives Matter protests have brought renewed attention to issues of racial justice and equity, and many in the tech industry have voiced their support for these efforts.

But ultimately, much more needs to be done. The collapse of SVB is a wake-up call for the tech industry to address the disparities that have long plagued entrepreneurship, and to ensure that all entrepreneurs have the tools and resources they need to succeed.",1
160,'SNL' imagines former President Trump at the Last Supper,"The popular NBC show ""Saturday Night Live"" took its satire to a new level when it imagined former President Donald Trump at the Last Supper. The sketch began with Jesus and his disciples gathering around the table, but instead of breaking bread and sharing wine, they found themselves seated next to Trump. 

As the sketch continued, the former president made a series of inappropriate and offensive remarks, including insulting the disciples and taking credit for the bread and wine miracles. As expected, the skit has stirred up controversy with some accusing the show of crossing the line and others praising the performance.

""Saturday Night Live"" has long been known for its political commentary, and this sketch is far from the first time they have poked fun at Trump. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the show certainly has a knack for bringing attention to important issues through humor.",1
161,Memphis sends Justin J. Pearson back to the Tennessee House days after GOP lawmakers ousted him,"In a surprising turn of events, the Tennessee House of Representatives welcomed back a familiar face just days after he was ousted by his own party. Justin J. Pearson, a Republican representative from Memphis, was reinstated to his seat on Thursday, following intense backlash over his removal.

The controversial move to remove Pearson stemmed from his decision to vote against a bill that would have allowed permitless handgun carry in the state. The bill was strongly supported by the Republican Party, but Pearson bucked party lines and sided with Democrats in opposing it.

This prompted a swift response from Republican leadership, who stripped Pearson of his committee assignments and took steps to remove him from his seat. But the move was met with resistance from some Republicans who saw it as an overreach of power.

""The idea of punishing someone for making a conscience-driven vote is antithetical to the principles of our democracy,"" said Republican Representative Jeremy Faison, who was among those opposed to Pearson's ouster.

The controversy only grew from there, as several high-profile Republicans came out in support of Pearson and openly criticized their own party's tactics. Among them was former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, who called the move ""a mistake"" and urged Republicans to ""allow for differing opinions within our own party"".

The backlash gained momentum and eventually led to a vote on Thursday, in which the House decided to reinstate Pearson by a narrow margin of 52-45.

Speaking to reporters after the vote, Pearson expressed gratitude to his fellow lawmakers and reiterated his commitment to serving his constituents.

""I'm honored to be back in my seat and ready to get back to work for the people of Memphis,"" he said.

But the controversy surrounding Pearson's removal has raised significant questions about the state of politics in Tennessee and the role of party loyalty in governing.

For some, the move to oust Pearson represented a dangerous precedent, with implications beyond just one seat in the House.

""This sends a message to lawmakers that they need to toe the party line or risk losing everything,"" said Democratic Representative John Ray Clemmons. ""It's a dangerous path for our democracy.""

Others, however, defended the Republican Party's actions and argued that Pearson's vote was a betrayal of the party's core values.

""We have a responsibility to uphold the principles that our constituents elected us to defend,"" said Republican Representative Scott Cepicky. ""Sometimes that means making tough decisions and voting for bills that might not be popular, but are necessary for the good of the state.""

Regardless of where one stands on the issue, the drama surrounding Pearson's removal highlights the growing polarization within the Republican Party and the broader political landscape in Tennessee.

The state has long been a Republican stronghold, with GOP lawmakers holding a supermajority in both the House and Senate. But recent years have seen a rise in dissent among Republicans, particularly on social issues such as gun control and LGBTQ rights.

This has led to a growing divide within the party, with some Republicans aligning themselves more closely with moderate Democrats than their own party leaders.

The situation in Tennessee is not unique, of course. Similar divides have been playing out in statehouses and capitals across the country, underscoring the broader challenges facing the modern Republican Party.

As the country continues to grapple with a pandemic, economic crisis, and looming existential threats like climate change, the role of party loyalty and ideological purity in politics has taken on new urgency.

For some, the events surrounding Justin J. Pearson's ouster serve as a cautionary tale of how divisive politics can become when partisanship trumps reason and compassion.

""The only way we can move forward as a state and a country is to be willing to listen to each other, even when we disagree,"" said Democratic Representative Antonio Parkinson. ""We can't let our desire for power and control blind us to the needs of the people we were elected to serve.""",1
162,"Government to step up efforts to monitor health of East Palestine residents, first responders","In the wake of heightened concerns about the health effects of exposure to hazardous materials, the government of East Palestine has announced plans to step up efforts to monitor the health of residents and first responders in affected areas.

The move comes amid growing concern about the potential health risks posed by exposure to environmental pollutants, particularly in communities where industrial sites are located. Recent studies have linked exposure to hazardous materials to a range of serious health problems, including cancer, respiratory disease, and neurological disorders.

In response, the government of East Palestine has launched a series of initiatives aimed at monitoring the health of individuals who may have been exposed to these substances. These efforts will focus on both residents of affected communities and first responders who work in hazardous environments.

According to a statement from East Palestine's Department of Health, the government plans to establish a comprehensive monitoring program that will track the health of individuals over time, in order to identify any potential health effects that may be linked to exposure to hazardous materials.

""We are committed to protecting the health of our citizens and the brave first responders who work in hazardous environments,"" the statement read. ""Through this program, we hope to gain a better understanding of the health risks associated with exposure to environmental pollutants, so that we can take steps to mitigate these risks and protect the health and well-being of our community.""

Under the program, individuals who have been exposed to hazardous materials will be screened on a regular basis for a range of health conditions, including cancer, respiratory disease, and neurological disorders. The program will also include an environmental monitoring component, which will track the levels of hazardous materials in affected areas and provide data on potential health risks.

The government will work closely with local hospitals and medical professionals to establish the program, which is expected to be fully operational within the next year. The initiative is being funded through a combination of government grants and private donations.

The move has been welcomed by community leaders and activists, who have long been calling for greater efforts to monitor the health of individuals who may have been exposed to hazardous materials. For years, residents of East Palestine and other affected communities have complained about a range of health problems, many of which they believe may be linked to exposure to environmental pollutants.

""We are thrilled to see the government taking these important steps to protect the health of our community,"" said Sarah Johnson, a local activist who has been advocating for greater environmental protections in East Palestine. ""For too long, our concerns about the health risks posed by hazardous materials have been ignored. This new initiative is a major step forward in addressing these concerns and ensuring that our community is safe and healthy.""

The move also underscores the growing awareness of the potential health risks posed by exposure to hazardous materials, as well as the need for greater monitoring and regulation of these substances. In recent years, there has been a growing push for stricter environmental regulations, particularly in communities where industrial sites are located.

The issue has also become a major political topic, with many lawmakers calling for more aggressive action to address environmental risks. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile cases of industrial pollution, including the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the ongoing controversy over the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Despite these challenges, activists and government officials remain committed to protecting the health and well-being of affected communities. The new initiative in East Palestine is just one example of the many efforts being made to address these concerns and ensure that environmental risks are minimized and managed effectively. As more communities confront these challenges, it is likely that we will see even more innovative approaches and strategies for managing environmental risks and protecting public health.",1
163,Video appears to show Israeli police throwing tear gas canisters at journalists,"A disturbing video has emerged on social media of Israeli police appearing to throw tear gas canisters at a group of journalists in East Jerusalem. The incident reportedly took place during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.

In the video, several journalists can be seen standing on a rooftop filming the events below when suddenly tear gas canisters are thrown in their direction. The journalists can be heard screaming and running from the noxious gas.

The incident has sparked outrage among journalists and media watchdog groups, who have accused Israeli police of targeting and attacking members of the press. The Committee to Protect Journalists has called on Israeli authorities to investigate the incident and hold those responsible accountable.

This is not the first time that Israeli police have been accused of attacking journalists. In recent weeks, there have been several reports of Israeli forces assaulting reporters and confiscating their equipment. These actions have been widely condemned by international media organizations.

The Israeli government has yet to comment on the incident, but it is crucial that they address the allegations of police brutality against the press. Freedom of the press is a fundamental right and should be protected at all costs.",1
164,French Finance Minister: Changes needed to ensure prosperity,"The French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, has called for changes to be made to ensure the prosperity of the country's economy. In his latest statement, Le Maire pointed out that France needs to adapt to the changing global economy and technological advancements to remain competitive.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference, the Finance Minister expressed concerns about the increasing competition coming from countries such as China and the United States, citing their aggressive economic policies and significant investments in research and development.

Le Maire highlighted the need for France to invest more in innovation and research, calling it the backbone of the French economy. He noted that the country needs to focus on emerging technologies such as AI, biotechnology, and green energy, which will drive job creation and growth in the coming years.

The Finance Minister also talked about the importance of reducing the administrative burden on businesses, facilitating access to financing, and simplifying the tax system. He emphasized that reducing regulatory barriers for new and small businesses is crucial to driving innovation and growth.

Le Maire acknowledged that building an innovative and sustainable economy would not be easy and would require a collective effort from government, businesses, and citizens. However, he expressed confidence that with proper planning, investment, and collaboration, France could lead the way in building a prosperous and sustainable future.

The Finance Minister's call for changes comes at a time when France is facing significant economic challenges, including high unemployment, low growth, and increasing debt. While there are no quick fixes, Le Maire's statement could serve as a rallying cry for policymakers, businesses, and citizens to work together towards building a stronger and more innovative economy.",1
165,Audio obtained by Washington Post claims to be from friend of Pentagon leaker,"A bombshell new development has emerged in the case of the Pentagon leaker, as the Washington Post has obtained what it claims is audio from a friend of the accused.

The individual, who has not been named by the Post, is heard on the recording discussing sensitive defense information and claiming to have received it from the leaker.

The significance of the audio is its potential to further implicate the leaker, who has already been charged with multiple counts of distributing classified information.

As the investigation into the case continues, the audio is sure to be of intense interest to both prosecutors and defense lawyers.

It remains unclear at this point whether the individual heard on the recording will face any charges as a result of their disclosed involvement.

The Pentagon leaker stands accused of transmitting classified information to a number of media outlets, in what has been described as one of the most significant leaks in recent US history.

The individual was working at the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time of the leaks, and has since been arrested and charged with a range of offenses.

The case has drawn significant attention from both media outlets and government officials, with many weighing in on the implications of such massive leaks of classified information.

The specific information disclosed by the leaker has not been publicly disclosed, but reports suggest that it could have significant implications for national security.

The case is likely to be closely followed by legal experts and media outlets for months to come, as the full scope and implications of the leaks are explored and debated.

The potential implications of the case extend far beyond mere legal or journalistic considerations, and could have ramifications for the broader relationship between government officials and the public they serve.

As the case progresses, it will be important for all involved parties to remain vigilant in protecting both the sensitive information at the heart of the case and the fundamental principles of transparency and accountability that underpin our democracy.",1
166,Wall Street says bad news is no longer good news. Here's why,"Wall Street has long played by the mantra that ""bad news is good news"" for the markets. The idea being that when there is negative economic news, such as a weak jobs report or a company missing earnings expectations, it often leads to more monetary stimulus from central banks or other forms of government intervention to bolster the economy.

But in recent months, that saying has lost its meaning as bad news is no longer translating to good news for the markets. So what has changed, and why is Wall Street having trouble reacting to the news?

One major factor is the coronavirus pandemic. The global health crisis has upended the economy and caused unprecedented levels of uncertainty in the financial markets. When news about the virus first emerged, the markets initially reacted positively to stimulus and relief packages from governments and central banks around the world. But as the virus has persisted and the economic toll has become more apparent, bad news is no longer being interpreted as a sign of potential monetary stimulus.

Another significant factor is the upcoming United States presidential election. As the November election draws near, investors are on edge, unsure of what the outcome might mean for the economy and the markets. This has led to a deluge of political news that can affect investor sentiment and cause significant market volatility. Bad news related to the election or political unrest is no longer a guarantee of government intervention, and as such, market reactions to such events are not as positive as they once were.

There are also broader economic factors at play that have contributed to the shift in how bad news is received by the markets. With interest rates already at historic lows, there is limited room for monetary policy to bolster the economy. This means that even if bad economic news does lead to government intervention, it may not be as effective as it would have been in years past.

Furthermore, the markets have become increasingly expensive, with valuations for many companies at all-time highs. This has made investors more cautious, and bad news can cause significant drops in share prices as investors flee the market out of fear of taking on too much risk.

Lastly, there is the issue of technical analysis. As more and more investors rely on computerized trading algorithms, the markets have become increasingly driven by technical indicators rather than fundamental factors like earnings reports or other economic data. This means that bad news can be quickly amplified as algorithms attempt to sell off stocks based on pre-determined parameters.

All of these factors have contributed to a Wall Street that is less responsive to bad news than it once was. But what does this mean for investors and the economy as a whole?

For one, it means that investors need to be more cautious and risk-averse when it comes to their investment strategies. With bad news no longer a guarantee of government intervention, investors need to be more selective in their investment choices and more focused on companies with solid fundamentals rather than ones that may be more volatile in response to the news.

It also means that policymakers need to consider alternative measures beyond monetary stimulus to bolster the economy. With interest rates already at near-zero levels, there may be limited ability for central banks to provide additional stimulus. This means that governments may need to focus on fiscal stimulus and other interventions to keep the economy moving.

Furthermore, the shift in how bad news is interpreted by the markets underscores the need for better risk management strategies. Companies need to be proactive in identifying potential risk factors and taking steps to mitigate them. This may mean revisiting supply chain strategies, customer diversification, and other factors that can help protect the company from inevitable economic downturns.

Ultimately, the shift in how bad news is interpreted by the markets is a reflection of the broader economic and geopolitical environment. Whether the markets will return to their previous relationship with bad news remains to be seen, but for the time being, investors and policymakers need to adjust their strategies accordingly.

The coronavirus pandemic and the upcoming United States presidential election have created an environment of unparalleled uncertainty, and it is up to investors and policymakers to navigate this new landscape with caution and strategic foresight.",1
167,The most-wanted clothing brands at resale are probably hanging in your closet,"When you think of clothing brands that are highly sought-after and in demand, you might immediately think of luxury brands like Gucci, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton. But, what if we told you that some of the most-wanted clothing brands at resale are probably hanging in your own closet right now?

According to recent studies, consumers are starting to prioritize sustainability and the circular economy. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the popularity and demand for secondhand clothing. With the rise of online marketplaces and reselling platforms like Poshmark, Depop, and ThredUp, consumers are not only able to shop for unique pieces at bargain prices, but they are also able to make more sustainable choices in their fashion purchases.

This renewed interest in secondhand clothing has also created a new market for pre-loved designer and high-end brands. While luxury brands like Gucci, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton are still popular, consumers are also placing value on lesser-known, yet still high-quality brands that are more accessible in terms of price.

One such brand is Reformation, known for its sustainable and stylish clothing. The brand's vintage-inspired pieces are popular among consumers, particularly their dresses that can easily transition from day to night. Reformation has gained a following for its environmental initiatives, including its use of eco-friendly fabrics and its practice of repurposing scraps and deadstock fabric.

Another brand that has seen a surge in popularity is Everlane. Known for its minimalist and classic aesthetic, Everlane offers affordable basics and wardrobe staples for both men and women. The brand has gained a cult following for its transparency and commitment to ethical production, as well as its eco-friendly practices such as using recycled materials for its packaging.

One of the biggest success stories in the pre-loved fashion space is Lululemon Athletica. Known for its high-quality athleisure clothing, Lululemon has become a favorite among consumers for its comfort and versatility. The brand's leggings have become a staple in many wardrobes, and their popularity has only continued to grow in the resale market.

Another brand that has gained traction in the pre-loved market is Madewell. The brand is known for its denim and casualwear, with their jeans being particularly popular among consumers. Madewell's focus on sustainability and ethical production practices have also contributed to its success in the resale market.

Urban Outfitters is another brand that has been in high demand in the resale market. The brand appeals to younger consumers with its trendy and eclectic clothing and accessories. Urban Outfitters' focus on sustainability and ethical production practices, including its use of eco-friendly materials in its Urban Renewal line, has also contributed to its success in the pre-loved market.

Consumers are also placing more value on sustainable clothing brands like Patagonia, known for its high-quality outdoor gear and environmentally-friendly initiatives. Patagonia's commitment to using recycled materials and its advocacy for environmental conservation have attracted a loyal customer base that is willing to pay premium prices for pre-loved items.

A new trend in the pre-loved market is the rise of luxury streetwear brands like Supreme and Off-White. These brands have gained a following for their limited edition releases and collaborations with high-profile artists and designers. Despite their high price tags, consumers are willing to pay top dollar for pre-loved items, making these brands some of the most-wanted in the resale market.

While you may not have thought of these brands as highly sought-after in the past, their increasing popularity in the pre-loved fashion space should not be ignored. Not only are they more accessible in terms of price compared to traditional luxury brands, but their commitment to sustainability and ethical production practices have also resonated with consumers.

As the fashion industry continues to grapple with its environmental impact, the rise of the pre-loved fashion market offers a more sustainable and ethical option for consumers. By choosing to shop secondhand and supporting brands that prioritize sustainability and ethical production practices, consumers can make a positive impact on the environment while still looking stylish and trendy.",1
168,'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' wins big at the box office with record opening,"In a world where nostalgia reigns supreme, it's no surprise that ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a smash hit at the box office. The film, based on the popular video game franchise of the same name, has broken records with its impressive opening weekend earnings.

Directed by John Leguizamo and starring a talented ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" has been eagerly anticipated by fans of the beloved game series. And now, after months of hype and promotion, the film has finally arrived - and audiences are loving it.

The film is a high-energy adventure that follows the titular characters, Mario and Luigi, as they journey through the Mushroom Kingdom to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser. Along the way, they encounter a colorful cast of characters, including the no-nonsense Toad, the treacherous King Koopa (Bowser's alter ego), and the mysterious and powerful Magikoopa.

While ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" certainly has a devoted and enthusiastic fanbase, it also had a lot to prove. Video game adaptations have traditionally been hit-or-miss at the box office, with many critics deriding them as shallow and poorly-written. However, this particular film has received overwhelmingly positive reviews, with many praising its inventive storyline, stunning visual effects, and surprisingly heartfelt performances.

""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" has also been a financial success, surpassing expectations and setting new records in its opening weekend. According to estimates from box office analysts, the film grossed upwards of $200 million in its first three days - surpassing the previous record holder, ""Avengers: Endgame,"" which earned $180 million in its opening weekend in 2019.

Some analysts attribute this success to the film's broad appeal - it's not just for die-hard video game fans, but also for families and younger audiences. The movie has received a PG rating, which makes it more accessible to a wider range of viewers.

But it's not just the broad appeal of the film that has contributed to its success. Many critics have pointed out how ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" manages to tap into the nostalgic feelings of grown-ups who grew up playing the video games. The film is packed with references and Easter eggs that will be familiar to longtime fans of the franchise, including cameos from characters like Yoshi and Wario.

Some critics have also praised the film for its ability to update the source material without losing the spirit that made the games so beloved in the first place. By weaving in modern technology and new storytelling techniques, the film feels fresh and exciting while still honoring the legacy of the games.

Of course, it's not just the impressive earnings that have people talking - it's also the performances from the cast. While many were skeptical of Chris Pratt's ability to play the iconic plumber Mario, the actor has shown a surprising depth and nuance in his portrayal. Anya Taylor-Joy, known for her work in period dramas like ""The Queen's Gambit,"" also surprises as the spunky and resourceful Princess Peach. And Jack Black steals the show as the wacky and unpredictable King Koopa.

Perhaps most impressive, however, is how ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" manages to avoid the pitfalls of other video game adaptations. Instead of taking itself too seriously or trying to be too faithful to the source material, the film strikes a perfect balance between being fun and lighthearted while still having high stakes and emotional resonance.

In an era where franchise fatigue and superhero burnout are becoming increasingly prevalent, ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is a refreshing and welcome change of pace. It's a film that manages to appeal to both adults and children, with a sense of humor and adventure that can't help but bring a smile to your face.

As the film continues to dominate at the box office, it's clear that ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" has struck a chord with audiences. Whether it's the nostalgia factor, the impressive visuals, or the talented cast, there's something about this film that works. And as we head into the holiday season, it's likely that ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" will continue to be a box office powerhouse.

So if you're looking for a fun and entertaining film that will leave you feeling happy and fulfilled, look no further than ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" It's a film that proves that video game adaptations can be done right - and that sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of heart and humor to make magic happen on the big screen.",1
169,Jessica Lynch Fast Facts,"Jessica Lynch Fast Facts

Jessica Dawn Lynch was thrust into the national limelight when she was captured during the Iraq War in 2003. The young soldier became the subject of international news coverage when her rescue mission became a major geopolitical event. Here are some fast facts about Jessica Lynch.

Early Life 

Jessica Lynch was born on April 26, 1983, in Palestine, West Virginia. She grew up in a rural area with her parents and two younger siblings. Lynch had a passion for sports, particularly basketball and track. She was known as a hard worker and excelled in athletics, earning all-state honors in both sports.

Education and Military Career 

Lynch attended Wirt County High School, where she graduated in 2001. Following graduation, she joined the United States Army, hoping to pursue a career in the healthcare field. She underwent basic training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina before being stationed at Fort Bliss in Texas.

In 2003, Lynch and her unit, the 507th Maintenance Company, were deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On March 23, 2003, Lynch's convoy was ambushed, and she was captured by Iraqi forces. Lynch suffered multiple injuries, including fractures in her arm, leg, and back. She was taken prisoner and held captive for nine days.

Rescue and Recovery 

On April 1, 2003, Lynch was rescued by a team of U.S. Special Forces soldiers, who breached the hospital where she was being held. The operation was broadcast live on television, and it was heralded as a major victory for the U.S. military. However, the story of Lynch's capture and rescue was later called into question.

After her rescue, Lynch was transported to a military hospital in Germany, where she underwent surgeries and extensive medical treatment. She was later transferred to a rehabilitation center in Washington, D.C., where she continued her recovery. Lynch was awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Prisoner of War medals for her service.

Controversy and Criticism 

While Lynch's rescue was initially celebrated as a triumph, questions were soon raised about the accuracy of the narrative that had been presented to the public. The Pentagon and the Bush administration had portrayed Lynch as a fierce fighter who had put up a heroic resistance during her capture. However, it later emerged that Lynch had been badly injured and was unable to defend herself.

Furthermore, it was revealed that the rescue operation had been staged for the benefit of the media, with military officials providing misleading information to journalists. Many critics accused the government of using Lynch's story for propaganda purposes and exploiting her for political gain.

Personal Life and Activism 

Following her recovery, Lynch was honorably discharged from the army and returned to her hometown in West Virginia. She enrolled in college and studied psychology and counseling, earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in 2011. She also married her long-time boyfriend, Wes Robinson, and they have two children together.

In recent years, Lynch has become an advocate for veterans' rights and has spoken out about the challenges that returning soldiers face. She has criticized the government's handling of the Iraq War and has called for more resources to be dedicated to helping veterans cope with the physical and mental trauma that they experience in combat.

Conclusion 

Jessica Lynch's story is both inspiring and controversial. Her bravery and resilience in the face of adversity have earned her admiration and respect from people around the world. However, the political and media exploitation of her story have also made her a symbol of the darker aspects of war propaganda. Despite the controversies surrounding her capture and rescue, Lynch has remained committed to advocating for veterans and helping them to overcome the trauma of their service. Her legacy is one of courage, determination, and compassion.",1
170,Officials: Business owner 'fully responsible' for recycling plant fire emitting toxic smoke,"A recycling plant fire in the city of East Los Angeles that emitted toxic smoke was the result of a business owner's negligence and disregard for safety measures, according to officials.

The fire broke out early morning on Thursday and hundreds of firefighters were on the scene trying to contain the flames. The plant recycled plastics and metals, and the toxic smoke spread quickly, prompting officials to order residents to stay indoors and keep their windows shut. Many people reported respiratory problems and eye irritation as a result of the smoke.

Following a thorough investigation, officials revealed that the business owner had failed to maintain the plant's equipment and machinery, including the fire suppression systems. Firefighters found that many of the suppressions systems were filled with debris and hadn't been serviced in years, allowing the fire to spread quickly.

The business owner was charged with multiple counts of negligence and put under arrest. Officials stated that they will not tolerate such negligence and oversight from business owners in the region, especially when it poses such a grave threat to the health and wellbeing of the community.

The incident underscores the importance of proper maintenance and adherence to safety measures in industries that involve hazardous materials. It also highlights the need for stricter regulations and consequences for those found to be in violation of such standards.

The cleanup and recovery of the affected area could take several weeks or even months. The local authorities have issued an advisory to the residents, urging them to contact medical professionals if they experience any health issues related to the incident.",1
171,Nearly 40% of dementia cases can be prevented with one small health change,"A new study has found that making just one small health change can prevent nearly 40% of dementia cases. The finding has significant implications for public health policies and could help to reduce cases of dementia in the future.

Research conducted by the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care has revealed that around 35% of dementia cases are related to factors that could be modified or prevented. One of the most important things that people can do to reduce their risk of developing dementia is to treat hearing loss.

According to the study, hearing loss in mid-life is responsible for 9% of cases of dementia. Hearing loss is a common problem, affecting around one in six people in the UK. If left untreated, it can lead to social isolation, depression and cognitive decline. However, treating hearing loss with hearing aids and other interventions can help to reduce the risk of developing dementia.

The study also found that reducing levels of high blood pressure and obesity, and increasing physical activity could also help to reduce the risk of dementia. The authors of the study have called for greater investment in public health strategies to tackle these modifiable risk factors.

This groundbreaking study shows that even small health changes can have a big impact on dementia risk. By taking steps to improve hearing and tackle other modifiable risk factors, we can help to prevent dementia and improve the lives of millions of people around the world.",1
172,"Gunman livestreamed mass shooting at Louisville bank that left 5 dead and 8 injured, police say","Louisville, Kentucky - A gunman livestreamed a mass shooting at a bank in downtown Louisville Thursday morning that left five people dead and eight more injured, according to police.

The shooting occurred at around 9 a.m. at the PNC Bank on the corner of 5th and Liberty streets in the heart of Louisville's business district. Witnesses reported a lone gunman walking into the bank wearing a ski mask and carrying a rifle before opening fire indiscriminately on customers and employees.

A spokesperson for the Louisville Metro Police Department confirmed the shooter had livestreamed the attack on Facebook Live, a feature on the social media platform that lets users broadcast live video to their friends and followers. The video was quickly removed by Facebook, but not before it was shared widely on other social media sites and news outlets.

The police have identified the shooter as 29-year-old Raymond Wilder, a local man with a history of mental health issues and a criminal record. Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said at a press conference that Wilder was killed during a shootout with police officers who had arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting began.

""This is a terrible tragedy for the families of the victims, for our community, and for our country,"" Conrad said. ""We don't yet know the motive for this senseless act of violence, but we do know that we need to work together as a society to address the problem of gun violence in America.""

The victims have been identified as four bank employees and one customer. Their names have not been released pending notification of their families. The eight people injured in the shooting were taken to area hospitals with a range of injuries, from minor to critical.

One witness, who wished to remain anonymous, described the chaos that ensued after the shooting started.

""I was in line at the bank when I heard what sounded like firecrackers going off,"" she said. ""Then people started running and screaming and I realized it was gunfire. I ducked behind a counter and called the police. I never thought something like this could happen here.""

The shooting has sent shockwaves through Louisville, a city that has seen its share of gun violence in recent years but has never experienced anything on this scale. Mayor Greg Fischer expressed his condolences to the victims' families and called for unity in the face of tragedy.

""We are one community, and together we will get through this,"" he said in a statement. ""But we need to do more to prevent senseless acts of gun violence from happening in the first place. We need to find common ground and work together to create a safer society for all Americans.""

The shooting comes just two months after a similar incident in Odessa, Texas, where a gunman killed seven people and injured 22 others in a rampage across several neighborhoods. The Texas shooting was also livestreamed on social media, leading to calls for stricter regulation of video content online.

In recent years, mass shootings have become a regular occurrence in America, with an average of more than one incident per day in 2019 alone. The issue of gun control has become one of the most contentious political debates in the country, with advocates on both sides arguing passionately for their positions.

President Donald Trump has been a vocal supporter of the right to bear arms, and has resisted calls for stricter gun control measures in the wake of mass shootings like the one in Louisville. He tweeted his condolences to the victims' families on Thursday, but did not comment on the larger issue of gun violence in America.

The shooting has also reignited the debate over mental health care in America, with many advocates calling for better access to treatment and support for those struggling with mental illness.

""We need to do more to address the root causes of this kind of violence,"" said Dr. Richard Besser, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. ""That means investing in mental health care, working to reduce social isolation, and creating a culture of kindness and compassion in our communities.""

The investigation into the Louisville shooting is ongoing, and police are asking anyone with information to come forward. The PNC Bank branch remains closed while investigators process the scene, and grief counselors have been made available to help employees and customers affected by the shooting.

""This is a tragedy that reminds us all of the fragility of life,"" said Fischer. ""We will mourn the loss of these innocent lives, and we will work to create a more just and compassionate society where senseless acts of violence like this can never happen again.""",1
173,Search continues for missing Sherpas on Everest as Nepal gears up for new climbing season,"Search continues for missing Sherpas on Everest as Nepal gears up for new climbing season

Nepal is gearing up for a new climbing season on Mount Everest as the search continues for three missing Sherpas who were swept away by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall area on April 26th.

The Sherpas were part of a team that was climbing to fix ropes and prepare the route for the upcoming season. Their disappearance has raised safety concerns and led to calls for better working conditions for Sherpas who are vital to the success of Everest expeditions.

The search for the missing climbers has been hampered by poor weather conditions, difficult terrain, and the risk of avalanches. Rescuers have been using helicopter flights and ground searches in hopes of finding the missing Sherpas.

Climbers and expedition companies have expressed their condolences to the families of the missing Sherpas and have emphasized the role that Sherpas play in successful Everest expeditions.

""Without Sherpas, there would be no Mount Everest climbing industry,"" said Tashi Tenzing, grandson of Tenzing Norgay, the Sherpa who was one of the first people to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

Tenzing, who runs a mountaineering company, called for better working conditions and better access to healthcare and insurance for Sherpas.

""We need to ensure that our Sherpa brothers and sisters are properly looked after,"" he said.

Reforms have been made in recent years to improve safety standards and conditions for Sherpas who work on Everest expeditions. In 2014, an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas, prompting discussions about improving salaries, insurance, and other benefits.

Since then, expedition companies have pledged to provide better equipment and training for their Sherpa staff. The Nepal government has also increased compensation for the families of Sherpas who die while working on expeditions.

However, these reforms have not been enough to address the underlying issues facing Sherpas on Everest. Many Sherpas still face difficult working conditions and long hours without adequate compensation or access to healthcare.

The search for the missing Sherpas highlights the need for continued efforts to improve the safety and working conditions for Sherpas on Everest. As the new climbing season approaches, it is important for all members of the climbing community to come together to ensure that Sherpas are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.

Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain, with its summit standing at 29,029 feet above sea level. Climbing to the top of Everest is a feat that has captivated adventurers for over a century. Each year, thousands of climbers attempt to summit the mountain, with the peak climbing season running from late April to early June.

The trek to the summit is a long and arduous journey, which typically takes several weeks to complete. The climb is guided by Sherpas, who are the backbone of the Everest expedition industry.

Sherpas are an ethnic group from the Himalayan region and are known for their mountaineering skills. They are often hired by expedition companies to serve as guides, porters, and support staff for climbers attempting to summit Everest.

Sherpas are responsible for setting up base camps, carrying equipment and supplies, and preparing the route up the mountain. They are also responsible for assisting climbers who become sick or injured during the climb.

However, despite the vital role that Sherpas play in Everest expeditions, they often face difficult working conditions and low pay. Many Sherpas work long hours and are paid only a fraction of what foreign climbers and companies make.

In addition, Sherpas face significant risks while working on the mountain. They are often exposed to extreme weather conditions, altitude sickness, and the risk of avalanches.

The avalanche that killed 16 Sherpas in 2014 prompted a conversation about the working conditions and compensation of Sherpas on Everest. After the incident, the Nepalese government increased the minimum insurance compensation for Sherpas and other workers on Everest. The amount was increased from USD $10,000 to USD $15,000.

However, many Sherpas argue that the reforms made in recent years have not gone far enough. They have called for increased compensation and better working conditions, including access to healthcare and insurance.

In addition to the risks that Sherpas face, climbing Everest also poses significant dangers for foreign climbers. According to data from the Nepal Mountaineering Association, 306 people have died while attempting to climb Everest since 1922.

Despite the risks, climbing Everest remains a popular goal for many adventurers. In recent years, there has been a surge in the number of climbers attempting to summit the mountain, leading to concerns about the impact on the environment and on the local Sherpa communities.

Climbing Everest also carries a significant financial cost. Expedition companies charge tens of thousands of dollars for climbers to join an expedition, with many climbers spending upwards of USD $50,000 for the experience.

As the new climbing season approaches, it is important to remember the vital role that Sherpas play in the success of Everest expeditions. It is also important to continue the conversation about the working conditions and compensation for Sherpas on the mountain.

While reforms have been made in recent years, there is still much work to be done to ensure that Sherpas are properly compensated and protected while working on Everest.

As climbers from around the world prepare to make their way to the summit of Mount Everest, it is important to keep the missing Sherpas and their families in our thoughts and to work together to create a safer and more equitable climbing industry.",1
174,"Whether you're a 'shark,' 'teddy bear' or 'fox,' here's how to ease conflict with family and friends","Whether you're a 'shark,' 'teddy bear' or 'fox,' here's how to ease conflict with family and friends

Conflict is a normal part of human interaction. In fact, it's what makes us who we are. It allows us to express ourselves, share our opinions, and express our emotions. Without conflict, we wouldn't have debates, enjoy challenging conversations or learn from our differences.

However, conflicts can also cause stress, anxiety and affect our relationships with those we love. Family conflicts, in particular, can be especially vexing since they can have lasting impacts on our relationships with our relatives. It is, therefore, important to learn how to handle conflicts with family and friends without damaging our connections.

One way to accomplish this is by understanding people's conflict styles. Conflict styles refer to the ways people approach conflict and the strategies they use to manage their emotions and resolve disagreements. 

There are typically four conflict styles: the 'shark,' the 'teddy bear,' the 'owl' and the 'fox.' Each of these styles has a different approach to conflict resolution, and familiarizing oneself with these styles can help people manage conflict effectively, ultimately strengthening their interpersonal relationships.

Sharks vs. Teddy Bears

Sharks and Teddy Bears are polar opposites when it comes to conflict resolution styles.

Sharks, also known as 'competing' conflict styles, are forceful, assertive negotiators who tend to be more direct and confrontational. Sharks love to win, and they want to get their way in any conflict. They are confident and have a strong sense of self-worth, which can make them intimidating for others.

On the other hand, bears, or 'collaborating' conflict styles are more relationship-focused, emphasizing harmony and building consensus. Teddy bears are empathetic, caring individuals who value the people involved in the conflict over winning the argument. Their focus is on finding a solution to the problem that works for everyone.

Given the contrasting styles, it isn't hard to see how the shark and teddy bear can easily clash. The shark's directness can appear aggressive and confrontational to the teddy bear, while the bear's empathy can be interpreted by the shark as weak and lacking in assertiveness. 

To bridge this gap and resolve conflict effectively, both parties need to understand each other's conflict styles and how to manage them. For instance, the shark may need to understand the importance of relationship building to the teddy bear and learn to adopt a more collaborative approach to negotiation. The teddy bear, on the other hand, needs to appreciate the shark's need to win and manipulate the situation to avoid direct confrontations.

Understanding the 'Owl' and the 'Fox'

Apart from sharks and teddy bears, 'owl' and 'fox' are two other main conflict styles.

Owls or 'accommodating' conflict styles, prioritize harmony and the preservation of the relationship above all else. Owls are more passive, preferring to let others take the lead in conflicts. They are usually very accommodating, sometimes to the point of being a pushover.

Foxes, on the other hand, are 'compromising' conflict styles. They seek to find middle ground in conflicts, a solution that solves the problem to some extent, albeit not in a perfect way. Foxes are usually good at negotiating to make sure everyone gets something they want.

To resolve conflicts effectively with owls and foxes, it's essential to understand their approach to conflict resolution. Owls often avoid conflict by playing peacemaker, which can mean they don't express their needs, and feelings. To manage conflict with owls, it's essential to create a safe environment where they can share their needs without fear of conflict.

For foxes, it is key to understand that they are trying to find a middle ground. They are not aiming for a perfect solution. Therefore, brainstorming ideas and coming up with potential solutions that can be amended to create a middle ground will lead to more effective conflict resolution.

The Importance of Self-Awareness

The first step to effective conflict resolution is self-awareness. Understanding your own conflict resolution style can help you manage your emotions better and react more constructively during disputes. It can also help you acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses in conflict resolution.

To be self-aware, you need to learn to observe your feelings and responses during a conflict. Ask yourself questions such as, 'how do you manage? What triggers you? What are your moral values? Are you willing to compromise, if so, how much?' Answering these questions can help you identify your conflict style and what you need from others to manage conflicts effectively. 

The Key to Conflict Resolution: Effective Communication

Effective communication is vital for conflict resolution. Listening to the other party's point of view is essential to resolve the conflict successfully. A heated argument will only exacerbate the situation.

Effective communication involves the use of active listening, eye contact, open body language, a calm tone of voice, and patience. It would be best if you also tried to understand the other party's perspective and respond to it. Pushing for your ideas will not create any effective resolution. 

Lastly, Nonviolence and respect-a key principle in resolving conflict. You must show respect for yourself and others during disagreements. At the same time, it is critical not to resort to any form of violence in conflict resolution. Disrespect can aggravate the situation, making it harder for parties to work together and find common ground.

Conclusion

In a perfect world, conflicts wouldn't exist. The reality, however, is that disputes are commonplace everywhere and can affect relationships with friends and family. Understanding conflict styles is critical in managing disagreements and easing tensions effectively. Whether you're a shark, teddy bear, owl, or fox, knowing how you approach conflicts can help you navigate tense situations and manage emotions more effectively. Efficient communication and the willingness to compromise and respect others are essential ingredients for conflict resolution. By adopting these strategies, individuals can manage conflicts in their personal and professional lives successfully.",1
175,What we know about the gunman who opened fire at a Louisville bank,"Louisville, KY (CNN) - A gunman opened fire at a Fifth Third Bank in downtown Louisville, Kentucky on September 6, 2018, killing two and injuring several others before being shot and killed by law enforcement. The incident sent shockwaves through the community and sparked a nationwide conversation about gun control, mental health, and mass shootings.

As details continue to emerge about the shooting and the gunman behind it, a clearer picture of what happened and why is beginning to emerge. Here's what we know so far:

The Shooter
The shooter was identified as 48-year-old Fuaed Abdo Ahmed, a Somali immigrant who had been living in the United States since 2000. Ahmed was a former employee of a local food delivery company and had a criminal record that included domestic violence, assault, and drug charges, among others.

According to officials, Ahmed had no known ties to terrorism and there was no evidence to suggest he was targeting anyone specifically at the bank. It appeared to be a random act of violence.

The Incident
The shooting began around 9:05 am, when Ahmed walked into the Fifth Third Bank building located on Fifth and Main Streets in downtown Louisville. He was armed with a 9mm handgun and had multiple magazines of ammunition on him.

Ahmed immediately began firing on the people inside the bank, killing two and injuring several others. He then exchanged gunfire with responding law enforcement officers before being shot and killed.

In total, four people were killed, including the shooter, and two others were injured. Those killed were identified as 51-year-old Terry L. Lee and 72-year-old Mary C. Osborne, both Louisville residents. The two injured were taken to a local hospital and were expected to recover.

Reaction to the Shooting
The shooting was met with shock and horror across the country, with local and national leaders offering condolences to the victims and their families.

In a statement, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said, ""There is much we don't know yet about what happened, but I can tell you this: We will get through this, and we will do it together.""

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer also released a statement, saying, ""This is a tragedy for our city. My heart breaks for the families of the victims that have been killed.""

President Donald Trump also weighed in, calling the shooting ""a very serious situation"" and offering support to local authorities.

The Debate Over Gun Control
The shooting reignited the debate over gun control in the United States, with many calling for stricter regulations on firearms.

According to the Gun Violence Archive, which tracks gun-related incidents in the US, this was the 247th mass shooting of 2018. In the wake of the shooting, many pointed to the need for stronger gun laws, such as universal background checks and bans on assault weapons.

However, others argued that stricter gun laws would not have prevented the shooting and that mental health was the real issue.

The Role of Mental Health
In the days following the shooting, it was discovered that Ahmed had a history of mental illness and had reportedly been receiving treatment for schizophrenia.

Some argued that the shooting was evidence of the need for better mental health services and support in the United States.

In a statement, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) said, ""It is critical that we work together to ensure that people living with mental illness get the help and support they need before they reach a crisis point.""

Others, however, pointed out that the majority of people with mental illness are not violent and that blaming the shooting on mental illness was stigmatizing and unhelpful.

Moving Forward
As the investigation into the shooting continues, the community of Louisville and the nation as a whole are left to grapple with the tragedy and its many implications.

Some have called for increased security measures at public buildings, such as metal detectors and armed guards. Others have pointed to the need for better access to mental health care and the importance of addressing the root causes of gun violence.

Whatever the solution, it is clear that the shooting has sparked an important conversation about the role of guns and mental health in our society. Whether meaningful change will result remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the victims and their families will never be forgotten.",1
176,Record warmth in areas with a record snowpack may cause hazardous flooding this week,"Record Warmth in Areas with a Record Snowpack May Cause Hazardous Flooding This Week

As the snow melts and temperatures rise, communities across the United States are facing the risk of destructive flooding. Areas with a record snowpack are particularly vulnerable to this natural disaster as temperatures are expected to soar this week, reaching levels that have not been seen in years.

In recent years, the impact of climate change has become increasingly evident in the United States. The United States Global Change Research Program's National Climate Assessment, published in 2018, warned that warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent and severe flooding events. The Assessment warned that this trend will only continue unless steps are taken to mitigate the impact of climate change.

One of the most significant impacts of climate change is the increase in extreme weather events, including flooding. This increase is due to a combination of factors, including the warming of the planet's atmosphere, which leads to more moisture in the air, as well as changes in precipitation patterns. These changes have already begun to take a toll on communities across the country.

This week, areas with a record snowpack will face the added risk of flooding due to record warmth. In areas such as the Pacific Northwest and the Upper Midwest, temperatures are expected to reach levels not seen in years.

According to the National Weather Service, the combination of rain and warm temperatures is expected to cause significant melting of the snowpack, leading to heavy runoff and potential flooding. The risks are particularly high in areas with steep terrain, where water runoff can quickly become dangerous.

Communities are already taking action to prepare for the worst. In the Pacific Northwest, where snowpacks in many areas are at record levels, authorities have been monitoring the situation closely. In some areas, residents have been advised to evacuate as a precautionary measure.

The threat of flooding is not just limited to areas with a record snowpack. In many areas, heavy rainfall and strong storms are also contributing to the risk of flooding.

In the Upper Midwest, for example, severe thunderstorms are forecast to move through the region, bringing with them the threat of flash flooding. The situation is particularly concerning in areas that have already experienced flooding in recent weeks. Cities such as Minneapolis and Des Moines are among those at risk.

At a time when many communities are already struggling to recover from recent flooding, the added risk of further flooding is a significant concern. Local officials are working to ensure that emergency response plans are in place and that residents are aware of the risks.

Despite these efforts, there are concerns that not enough is being done to address the root cause of this problem. Climate change is driving the increase in extreme weather events, and unless significant action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these events will only become more frequent and more severe.

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need to take action to address climate change. The Paris Agreement, signed by nearly every country in the world in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Despite this agreement, significant challenges remain in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries, including the United States, have not yet taken sufficient action to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement.

One of the most significant barriers to progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the continued reliance on fossil fuels. The burning of coal, oil, and gas is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions, and until the world transitions to cleaner energy sources, this problem will persist.

In recent years, there has been progress on this front. The cost of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power has dropped significantly, making them increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. There has also been a growing awareness of the need to reduce consumption of energy and to increase energy efficiency.

Despite these positive developments, there is still much work to be done. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impact of climate change.

At the government level, policies that incentivize the transition to cleaner energy sources are essential. These policies could include subsidies for renewable energy projects, taxes on carbon emissions, and regulations that encourage energy efficiency.

Businesses also have a crucial role to play. Many companies have already begun to transition to renewable energy sources, and this trend is expected to continue. There are also opportunities for businesses to improve energy efficiency and reduce waste.

Individuals also have a role to play. Reducing energy consumption at home, for example, through the use of LED light bulbs and energy-efficient appliances, can make a significant impact. There are also opportunities to reduce emissions through transportation choices, such as walking, cycling, or using public transport.

The risks posed by extreme weather events such as flooding are likely to increase in the coming years, with climate change driving more frequent and severe events. While there is no easy solution to this problem, there are steps that can be taken to reduce the risks and mitigate the impact.

By transitioning to cleaner energy sources, reducing energy consumption, and taking steps to improve energy efficiency, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the rate of climate change. This, in turn, will help to reduce the risks of flooding and other extreme weather events, protecting communities across the country from the devastating impact of these natural disasters.",1

178,Japan's population drops by half a million in 2022,"Japan's population drops by half a million in 2022 

Japan, once the land of the rising sun, is currently facing a major demographic crisis. The country has been struggling with population decline over the last few decades, but the situation has now reached a critical stage. According to the latest figures, the population has dropped by half a million in 2022, marking the largest annual decline on record. This is a significant blow to Japan's economy and social structure, and has raised concerns about the country's future.

The government has been aware of the issue of population decline for some time now, and has made several attempts to address it. These measures have included encouraging immigration, providing incentives for couples to have children, and increasing the retirement age. However, these efforts have largely failed to have a significant impact.

So, what is causing Japan's population decline, and why is it so significant? There are several factors at play, including a declining birth rate, an aging population, and a lack of immigration.

Firstly, Japan's birth rate has been declining for decades, and is now one of the lowest in the world. This is due to several factors, including a rise in the number of women who choose to pursue careers instead of having children, and a lack of affordable childcare options. Additionally, Japan's strict immigration policies mean that the country has a relatively small pool of potential parents, as compared to other countries.

Secondly, Japan's population is aging at an unprecedented rate. The number of elderly people in Japan has increased rapidly, with the proportion of people aged 65 and over expected to reach almost 40% of the total population by 2060, according to government estimates. This has put strain on the social welfare system, which has struggled to keep up with the needs of an aging population.

Finally, Japan's immigration policies have been strict for many years, making it difficult for foreigners to permanently settle in the country. This has led to a lack of manpower, particularly in lower-skilled jobs. The Japanese government has made some attempts to relax immigration policies, but the changes have been incremental and have not had a significant impact.

The decline in Japan's population has several significant implications for the country. Firstly, it has led to a decrease in the number of workers, which has made it difficult for companies to find skilled labor. This has resulted in a shortage of workers in several sectors, including construction, nursing, and hospitality. Additionally, the decline in Japan's population has meant that there are fewer taxpayers to support the country's social welfare system, which in turn has put strain on government finances. Lastly, it has led to a decline in the country's economic growth, as there are fewer people to buy goods and services.

The Japanese government has acknowledged the severity of the situation and has taken several measures to address it. One of the most significant initiatives has been to encourage more women to work and to provide better childcare options. The government has also increased the retirement age, despite resistance from some quarters. However, progress has been slow, and it is unclear whether these measures will be sufficient to address the population decline.

Another possible solution to the population crisis is increased immigration, which would bring in new workers and potentially boost economic growth. However, this option is politically sensitive, as many Japanese people are wary of allowing large numbers of foreigners into the country. The government has attempted to ease concerns by implementing a new system that allows highly skilled foreign workers to stay in the country for up to five years. However, critics argue that this is not enough to address the country's labor shortages.

Despite these challenges, there are some signs of hope. For example, there has been an increase in the number of foreign students studying in Japan, which could eventually lead to more immigrants to the country. Additionally, the government has raised awareness about the issue of population decline, which has helped to spark public discussion and debate about potential solutions.

Ultimately, the situation in Japan highlights a global issue that many countries will have to face in the coming decades. As birth rates decline and populations age, governments will need to find innovative solutions to maintain economic growth and social stability. For Japan, this will likely mean a combination of increased immigration, improved support for families, and innovative solutions to help older workers remain in the workforce. If successful, these measures could help to ensure a brighter future for Japan and its people. However, if the country fails to address its demographic crisis, the consequences could be dire.",1

180,Fire with toxic fumes could burn for days in Indiana,"A massive fire that broke out on Monday morning at a recycling plant in the US state of Indiana continues to rage on with toxic fumes. The inferno at the facility owned by NLMK, a Russian steel company that has a plant in Indiana, has been tearing through the warehouse where vehicle parts, Styrofoam, and other materials have been stored. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined.

Local authorities have warned residents within a two-mile radius of the plant to stay indoors and keep their windows and doors shut due to the air quality threat. The billowing black smoke and fumes have blanketed the area, prompting the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to issue an Air Quality Action Day in several counties surrounding the plant.

Employee evacuation and no reports of injuries have been confirmed, however, the threat of the blaze spreading to nearby buildings remains. With the current weather forecast, it appears that the fire could burn for days, putting the lives of nearby residents at risk.

The fire department and other emergency services are doing their best to control the flames, with at least a dozen fire trucks and several helicopters with water-dropping devices deployed to the scene. However, the smoke and fumes have proven to be challenging for crews, and the situation remains critical.

Local authorities have urged citizens to remain vigilant and follow guidelines issued to keep themselves safe while the firefighting operation continues.",1
181,"Michael Lerner, 'Barton Fink' and 'Elf' actor, dead at 81","Michael Lerner, the iconic actor best known for his roles in ""Barton Fink"" and ""Elf,"" passed away on Friday, August 27th. He was 81 years old.

Lerner's career spanned over five decades, and he made a lasting impact on Hollywood with his memorable performances. His talent as an actor was undeniable, and his contributions to the film industry are celebrated by fans and critics alike.

Born in Brooklyn, New York, on June 22nd, 1940, Lerner was raised in a Jewish household. He graduated from Brooklyn College with a degree in English, and he later earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in Drama from the Yale School of Drama.

Lerner's big break came in 1967, when he landed a role in the off-Broadway play ""The Madness of Lady Bright."" From there, he began to gain recognition in the theater world, and he soon made the transition to film.

Lerner made his film debut in the 1974 movie ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,"" playing the character of Mr. Green. He went on to appear in numerous films over the years, including ""Eight Men Out,"" ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" and ""Godzilla.""

However, Lerner is perhaps best known for his roles in two Coen Brothers films - ""Barton Fink"" and ""A Serious Man."" In ""Barton Fink,"" Lerner played the character of Jack Lipnick, the head of a Hollywood studio. Lerner's performance was praised by critics, and it earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In ""A Serious Man,"" Lerner played the character of Solomon Schlutz, a rabbi who appears to offer guidance and wisdom to the protagonist. Lerner's performance in the film was also well-received, and it cemented his status as a talented and versatile actor.

Lerner's other notable film roles include his portrayal of the Mayor in the 2003 comedy ""Elf,"" starring Will Ferrell, and his role as Sen. Brickman in the 1995 crime drama ""The Net,"" starring Sandra Bullock.

Beyond his work on the big screen, Lerner also had a successful career on television. He appeared in numerous TV shows throughout his career, including ""Law & Order,"" ""The Sopranos,"" and ""The West Wing.""

182,Hear police announce arrest of suspect in death of Cash App founder,"In a press conference held earlier today, police announced the arrest of a suspect in the death of Cash App founder, Jack Dorsey. The suspect, who has not yet been identified, was arrested after an investigation spanning several months.

Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and Square, was found dead in his San Francisco home on November 15th, 2020. The cause of death was initially unclear, but evidence gathered by investigators led them to believe foul play was involved.

In the press conference, police praised the hard work of their detectives in finding and apprehending the suspect. The motive for the crime is currently unknown and is likely to be revealed in the coming days.

Dorsey was a well-known figure in the tech industry and his sudden death shook the community. Many took to social media to express their shock and condolences.

Cash App, which Dorsey co-founded in 2013, has become increasingly popular in recent years as a way for people to quickly and easily transfer money to each other. The company has not yet commented on the arrest but is expected to release a statement soon.

183,China appears to simulate first aircraft carrier strike on Taiwan,"China appears to simulate first aircraft carrier strike on Taiwan

Taiwan has long been at the center of the geopolitical confrontation between China and the United States. For decades, Beijing has claimed Taiwan as part of its territory, and has vowed to take it back, by force if necessary. Meanwhile, Washington has been a staunch supporter of Taiwan's democratic government, providing it with arms and diplomatic cover.

In recent years, the situation has intensified, with China becoming more assertive in the region, and the US stepping up its military presence there. The latest development in this ongoing saga is a simulated aircraft carrier strike that China appears to have carried out against Taiwan.

On 13 August, a video emerged on social media showing a group of Chinese jet fighters taking off from an aircraft carrier, presumably the Liaoning, China's first operational carrier. The planes then fly toward a target, identified as Taiwan's Presidential Office Building, before dropping bombs and firing missiles.

The video, which was widely shared on Chinese social media platforms, caused a stir in Taiwan and around the world. Many analysts saw it as a warning shot from China, reminding Taiwan that it has the capability to target its most important government buildings and infrastructure.

While the video has not been authenticated, it is consistent with China's recent military activities in the region. In recent weeks, China has stepped up its military drills near Taiwan, with its aircraft and ships approaching the island's airspace and waters at an alarming rate.

In response, Taiwan has been boosting its own defenses, with its military conducting live-fire exercises and acquiring new weapons systems. The US has also been increasing its presence in the region, with its jets and warships patrolling the waters around Taiwan.

The simulated aircraft carrier strike is significant for several reasons. First, it shows China's growing military capabilities and determination to assert its control over Taiwan. The fact that China has the ability to launch a carrier-based strike against Taiwan's capital city is a clear sign that it has achieved a level of military sophistication that was once unthinkable.

Second, the video suggests that China is planning for a potential military conflict with Taiwan. While China has always said that it prefers a peaceful reunification with Taiwan, its recent activities suggest otherwise. The fact that China is openly displaying its military capabilities against Taiwan is a clear indication that it is preparing for the worst-case scenario.

Third, the simulated strike is a direct challenge to the US, which has repeatedly stated that it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack. By targeting Taiwan's Presidential Office Building, China is sending a message to the US that it is willing to take on its most powerful adversary in the region.

Finally, the video has sparked a debate about the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare. While aircraft carriers have long been considered the centerpiece of naval power, their effectiveness has been called into question in recent years. As China's anti-ship missile capabilities continue to improve, the vulnerability of aircraft carriers has become a major concern for military planners.

The simulated aircraft carrier strike against Taiwan raises questions about the future of aircraft carriers in the Indo-Pacific region. While the US has maintained a formidable carrier presence in the region, China's growing military capabilities threaten to undermine that advantage.

In conclusion, the simulated aircraft carrier strike against Taiwan is a worrying development in the ongoing geopolitical confrontation between China and the US. It highlights China's growing military capabilities and its determination to assert its control over Taiwan. It also poses a direct challenge to the US, which has long been committed to defending Taiwan. As tensions continue to escalate in the region, the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare is likely to become even more contentious. The world will be watching closely to see how the situation unfolds.",1
184,"Weight loss may mean a risk of death for older adults, study shows","Weight loss remains a key concern for many individuals, especially senior citizens. However, a recent study has found that weight loss can put older adults at an increased risk of death. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Glasgow and published in the British Journal of General Practice, has brought to light an alarming finding with far-reaching implications for health care professionals and individuals alike.

The study analyzed data from more than 193,000 individuals aged 65 and over, looking at their weight changes and mortality rates. The researchers identified that a loss of even a small amount of weight – as little as 5% of body weight – in older adults can significantly increase the risk of death.

Specifically, the study found that individuals who lost 5% of their body weight or more over a five-year period were at a 17% to 33% increased risk of mortality compared to individuals who maintained a stable weight. This risk further increased if the weight loss was unintentional or occurred over a shorter time frame.

These findings have significant implications for older adults who are attempting to lose weight, particularly those who are living with chronic conditions. It is not uncommon for medical professionals to advise individuals to lose weight in order to manage their health conditions. However, this study highlights that such advice may not be appropriate for older adults, particularly if they are already living with certain chronic conditions.

Dr. Stuart Gray, the lead author of the study, explained: ""Our findings suggest that clinicians should be cautious in recommending weight loss for older people. Instead, we need to focus on the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and physical activity that is appropriate for older people. This can help maintain muscle mass and physical function, which are crucial for older people to remain independent as they age.""

The study emphasizes the importance of adopting a holistic approach to weight management, particularly for older adults. This may involve a combination of dietary and lifestyle changes to achieve more sustainable weight loss, rather than relying solely on restrictive diets or extreme exercise regimes. Encouraging older adults to engage in physical activity that is appropriate for their age and health status is also crucial, as this can help to preserve muscle mass and physical function, which are key to maintaining independence and quality of life as one ages.

Carrying excess weight as one ages can also be problematic. However, this study highlights that the goal for older adults should be weight maintenance, rather than weight loss. This may involve shifting the emphasis from weight loss to metabolic health, which can better inform treatment decisions and improve overall health outcomes for older adults.

Moreover, doctors and healthcare professionals should be vigilant in monitoring older patients who have lost weight to ensure that the weight loss is not the result of an underlying medical issue. Unintentional weight loss is a significant concern for older adults, as it can be indicative of underlying chronic or acute medical conditions, such as cancer or dementia.

This study highlights that there is a pressing need for healthcare professionals to rethink the approach to weight management in older adults to improve health outcomes. In addition, healthcare professionals should also consider the potential consequences of unintentional weight loss and aim to identify the underlying cause in order to address it effectively.

Beyond the implications for healthcare professionals, this study also has broader societal implications, particularly in relation to the care of older adults. The study's findings underscore the importance of ensuring that older adults are provided with appropriate medical care and are supported to maintain their independence and quality of life as they age.

Furthermore, the study has important implications for policy makers, particularly in relation to the provision of resources and services for older adults. The study highlights that focus should be shifted from weight loss to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which can help maintain muscle mass and physical function, which are crucial for older people to remain independent as they age.

Overall, this study highlights the need for greater awareness among healthcare professionals, individuals, and policy makers of the potential risks associated with weight loss in older adults. As the population ages, it is increasingly important that we develop holistic approaches to weight management that are appropriate for older adults, that address the root cause of weight loss, and that prioritize supporting individuals to maintain their independence and quality of life as they age.",1
185,CDC to warn some travelers to watch for Marburg virus symptoms as it investigates outbreaks in Africa,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a warning to some travelers to be cautious about the Marburg virus. Marburg virus is a highly infectious disease that is often fatal, with a death rate of up to 90%. The virus is currently causing outbreaks in some countries in Africa.

This move comes as the CDC investigates several outbreaks of the Marburg virus in Africa. According to reports, there have been at least three outbreaks confirmed in Uganda in the last month, with a total of five cases and three deaths reported.

The CDC has not released the names of the countries that the warning applies to. However, officials have urged travelers to be aware of the symptoms of the disease and to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any symptoms.

Marburg virus is a member of the same family as Ebola virus and is similar in many ways. The virus is transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, such as bats or monkeys, or through contact with bodily fluids from infected humans.

Symptoms of Marburg virus can include fever, headache, muscle aches, and vomiting. In more severe cases, the disease can cause bleeding from the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body.

Experts say that the Marburg virus is much less common than Ebola virus, but it is still a serious concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been fewer than 600 confirmed cases of Marburg virus since the disease was first identified in 1967.

Despite the lower number of cases, the Marburg virus can be just as deadly as Ebola. In fact, the death rate for the Marburg virus is often even higher than the death rate for Ebola.

The CDC’s warning comes as health officials in Africa are working to contain the ongoing outbreaks of the virus. In Uganda, authorities have quarantined those who have become infected, as well as their close contacts, in an effort to prevent the disease from spreading further.

The WHO has also sent a team of experts to Uganda to help with the response to the outbreak. The team is working to trace the origins of the virus and identify any potential transmission routes.

The outbreak in Uganda is not the first time that the Marburg virus has caused concern in Africa. In 2005, an outbreak in Angola infected more than 200 people, killing at least 90% of those infected.

Despite the severity of the outbreak in Angola, health officials were able to contain the disease within a few months. However, the emergence of new outbreaks, such as those in Uganda, continue to be a concern for health officials.

Many experts believe that the spread of diseases such as Marburg and Ebola is linked to the destruction of natural habitats in Africa. Deforestation and the expansion of agriculture have brought humans into closer contact with wildlife, increasing the risk of disease transmission.

In addition, factors such as population growth, urbanization, and climate change are all thought to contribute to the spread of these diseases.

The CDC’s warning to travelers is an attempt to prevent the further spread of the Marburg virus. While the virus is rare, it can be deadly, and it is important for travelers to be aware of the symptoms and to seek medical attention right away if they become ill.

Health officials in Africa are also working to contain the outbreaks of Marburg virus, and it is hoped that the disease can be contained quickly to prevent a broader outbreak.

For those who are planning to travel to Africa, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with diseases such as Marburg and Ebola. Travelers should take precautions to avoid contact with potentially infected animals and should take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites and other insect vectors that can transmit these diseases.

In addition, travelers should be aware of the symptoms of these diseases and should seek medical attention immediately if they become ill.

Overall, the CDC’s warning underscores the importance of continued vigilance in the face of emerging health threats. By raising awareness about the Marburg virus and other infectious diseases, health officials can work to prevent the spread of these diseases and protect public health around the world.",1

Fans of the show are excited to see what new horrors the series will bring, especially with the addition of these two iconic actresses.

'American Horror Story' has been a cult favorite since its inception in 2011. The series is known for its unique storytelling style and horror-themed anthologies. Each season has a different storyline, but many of the same actors return to play new characters in each separate installment. This approach has kept fans intrigued and excited to see what the show will produce every year.

One of the show's most beloved returning actresses is none other than Emma Roberts. She has starred in multiple seasons of the show, including ""Coven,"" ""Freak Show,"" ""Cult,"" and ""Apocalypse."" Roberts announced her return to the series on Instagram, sharing a photo of the iconic 'American Horror Story' title card with the caption, ""Back where it all began...#AHS.""

Roberts has become a fan favorite due to her ability to effortlessly weave between different characters and storylines. She has been praised for her versatility as an actress, and her performances in past seasons have been highly regarded. Her participation in the upcoming season is sure to bring a new sense of excitement to the show's audience.

Along with Roberts, Kim Kardashian has also been confirmed to appear in the 12th season of 'American Horror Story.' Kardashian is known for her reality TV show, 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' but she has also made appearances in movies and TV shows over the years. This will be her first time appearing on 'American Horror Story'.

Kardashian has expressed her excitement regarding her upcoming performance in 'American Horror Story', telling her fans on social media, ""I'm so excited to be a part of the iconic 'American Horror Story' franchise! As a huge fan of the show, I'm honored to be joining this amazing cast.""

However, there has been some criticism and backlash surrounding Kardashian's casting. Some fans have voiced their concerns about Kardashian being given the opportunity to act in a show that many believe she has no professional training or talent for, believing that her fame alone isn't enough to justify her being cast in a show like 'American Horror Story.'

On the other hand, there are those who believe that Kardashian's casting will bring a new audience to the show, drawing in those who might not have been interested otherwise. This is a tactic that has worked well for previous seasons of 'American Horror Story', such as when Lady Gaga was cast in 'Hotel', bringing in a large fan base of her own.

No matter what side of the argument one might be on, it's clear that the upcoming season of 'American Horror Story' is sure to cause a stir among fans of the show, no matter if they are for or against Kardashian's casting. What remains to be seen is what kind of character Kardashian will play and how she will fare in a series where she must demonstrate both her acting abilities and her talent for performing horror genre content.

While it is unknown what roles both Kardashian and Roberts will play in the upcoming season, fans of the show are already speculating about what kind of characters they could portray. Roberts has played a multitude of characters throughout her time on the series, ranging from witches to antagonists.

Kardashian, however, is somewhat of a wildcard when it comes to predicting her character. As this is her first major acting role, there isn't a lot of evidence to suggest what kind of character she might be able to play. Many fans have speculated that she could potentially play a celebrity or influencer-type character, as that is a role that would fit her real-life persona.

Given that the show has a history of casting big-name stars in unconventional roles, it's possible that both actresses could surprise viewers with dynamic and unexpected performances.

As fans wait for more information regarding the upcoming season, it's clear that the anticipation is high. The series has proven time and time again that it is capable of producing engaging and thought-provoking content, and with the addition of Kardashian and the return of Roberts, the 12th season is sure to be no different.

'American Horror Story' season 12 is expected to air in the fall of 2022. Fans can't wait to see what horrors and surprises the show has in store.",1

The trailer for the movie was released on Wednesday and it shows the  -year-old superstar in a whole new light. JLo shares the screen with actors like Owen Wilson and Sarah Silverman in ""Mother"" which is set to stream on Netflix from November 24.

In ""Mother"", Lopez plays a character named Grace, who is a retired soldier and a mother. She flies down to a beach resort to reconnect with her estranged daughter, only to find that she has been abducted. Grace then embarks on a dangerous mission to save her daughter from the kidnappers.

The trailer released by Netflix gives us a glimpse of the action-packed thriller that is set to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.

The trailer opens with Jennifer Lopez having a conversation with her daughter, Stephanie (played by newcomer Madison Pettis). Stephanie, who didn't even know that her mother was in the military, seems somewhat baffled by all of this, asking, ""You're different now, what's going on?"" Lopez's character seems determined to make things right with her daughter, telling her that they will be able to talk about it all, as long as they're alive.

Soon after, the trailer takes a dramatic turn as Stephanie is seen getting kidnapped by people who intend to sell her to the highest bidder. It then shows Lopez's character, Grace, with her focus set entirely on finding her daughter, no matter what it takes.

The trailer shows us that Jennifer Lopez is undoubtedly the lead of this thriller, showcasing her magnificent physicality and agility as she runs, fights and protects her daughter. With her hair tied back tightly and no makeup, Lopez's performance is raw and gritty, showing her range and depth as an actor. This isn't the JLo we have seen in her glitz and glamour, but rather a mother on a mission to protect her offspring.

The teaser also shows Owen Wilson in a more serious role than we are used to seeing him in. He plays John, a tourist who helps Lopez's character in her search for her daughter. In a heartwarming moment, John tells Grace, ""I'm here to help you with whatever you need."" Sarah Silverman also makes an appearance in the trailer, playing a character named Patty Peterson.

It is notable that the trailer itself is very intense and does not give much away about the plot. This suggests that the film will hold many surprises for viewers who will watch it when it is released on Netflix.

Jennifer Lopez has a full history of compelling thriller performances. In 2013, she starred in ""Parker"" alongside Jason Statham, and earlier this year, she starred in the film ""Hustlers"" which received critical acclaim. Fans will understandably be excited to see what she can do in this most recent project.

""Mother"" was directed by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, who is known for his work in period dramas. This is his first high-octane thriller, and if the trailer is anything to go by, he is perfectly capable of handling the genre.

In recent interviews, Jennifer Lopez has talked about how her character in ""Mother"" resonated with her as it reflects her own experiences as a mother. She explained her thoughts as, ""I think we've all felt like 'I would die for my kids, I would do anything to keep them safe'"".

Lopez further revealed that filming was challenging and that she had to push herself physically to embody the character of Grace. She confessed that, ""It was the most challenging movie I think I've ever done physically and emotionally."" The trailer affirms this statement as we get glimpses of Lopez performing some of the action scenes effortlessly.

""Mother"" is another Netflix original film following the likes of the recent release ""The Harder They Fall"". It marks Jennifer Lopez's debut on the platform, and from the trailer and press coverage, we can already tell that it is poised to be a huge hit.

With just a few weeks until release, fans of the action-thriller genre are eagerly looking forward to what Jennifer Lopez has in store for them in her newest movie.",1
188,Alzheimer's and HRT: Study suggests sweet spot to avoid dementia,"Alzheimer's and HRT: Study suggests sweet spot to avoid dementia

As people age, many become concerned with maintaining their cognitive function and avoiding the effects of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. For years, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been considered a promising option for preserving brain function in menopausal and post-menopausal women. However, there have been concerns about the safety of HRT, particularly in regards to its possible links to dementia. A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego suggests that there may be a ""sweet spot"" for HRT use that can reduce the risk of dementia.

The study, which was published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, involved more than 1,700 women over the age of 65. The participants were asked about their use of HRT and were assessed for cognitive impairment using a variety of tests. The findings revealed that women who had used HRT within the last five years had a lower risk of developing dementia. In contrast, those who had used HRT for more than 10 years or who had never used HRT had a higher risk of cognitive impairment.

These findings are significant because they suggest that there may be a ""window of opportunity"" for women to use HRT and reduce their risk of dementia. The study's lead author, Dr. M. Maria Glymour, notes that ""women who use HRT close to the time of menopause may benefit the most in terms of brain health."" She adds that ""the timing of HRT use may be critical.""

The study's findings are particularly important given the controversy surrounding HRT use. In the early 2000s, a large study known as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) raised concerns about the safety of HRT, particularly its links to cancer, heart disease, and stroke. As a result, many women stopped using HRT, and its use declined sharply. However, subsequent studies have shown that HRT can be safe and effective for certain women, particularly those who are experiencing severe menopausal symptoms.

The new study's findings suggest that HRT may have a role to play in preserving cognitive function as well. However, it is important to note that the study only establishes an association between HRT use and reduced risk of dementia, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship. Other factors, such as education levels, income, and access to healthcare, could also play a role in the study's findings.

Despite these limitations, the study's authors believe that their findings are significant and warrant further investigation. They suggest that future research should focus on understanding the mechanisms by which HRT may protect against cognitive decline, as well as identifying which women stand to benefit the most from HRT use.

The study also underscores the importance of ongoing research into treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. While HRT use may represent a promising avenue for reducing the risk of cognitive decline, it is not a cure for Alzheimer's or a substitute for other forms of treatment. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing new drugs and therapies that can slow or even reverse the effects of dementia, and researchers around the world are exploring a wide range of potential treatments.

Despite the challenges of developing new treatments for Alzheimer's, there are promising signs of progress. Advances in imaging technology, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), have allowed researchers to gain unprecedented insights into the brain's structure and function, and are helping to identify new targets for treatment. In addition, new developments in gene therapy, stem cell research, and other fields hold promise for developing new ways to repair or regenerate damaged brain tissue.

Overall, the study offers some hope for women concerned about preserving their cognitive function as they age. While HRT is not a panacea for preventing dementia, the study suggests that it may have a role to play in reducing the risk of cognitive decline. However, more research is needed to understand the precise mechanisms by which HRT works, and to identify which women stand to benefit the most. In the meantime, it is important for women to discuss HRT use with their healthcare providers, and to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits before making a decision about HRT use.",1
189,A new procedure offers hope to 'no option' patients facing amputation because of severe circulation problems,"Amputation is an invasive surgical procedure that involves the removal of a limb or extremity due to severe circulation problems. It is a procedure that is often undertaken as a last resort to prevent the spread of infection, alleviate extreme pain, or save the life of the patient. For many patients who suffer from circulation problems that may lead to amputation, there is often little hope.

However, a new procedure has emerged that offers hope to patients who have been told that they have no option but to undergo amputation. The procedure, known as Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA), involves using a minimally invasive technique to open up blocked or narrowed arteries, improving blood flow to the affected limb. This procedure can be used as an alternative to amputation in some cases, saving the limb and improving the patient's quality of life.

PTA has been around since the 1970s and has been used to treat a range of circulation problems, including coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and other conditions that affect blood flow. The procedure involves inserting a narrow catheter into the affected artery, which is then guided to the site of the blockage or narrowing. A small balloon at the tip of the catheter is then inflated to compress the plaque that is causing the blockage or to stretch the narrowed artery, restoring blood flow.

Advancements in technology have made PTA safer and more effective, leading to an increased success rate in treating circulation problems. These advancements include the development of new imaging techniques, such as intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography, which provide clearer images of the arteries, making it easier for doctors to identify blockages and plan treatments.

One of the benefits of PTA is that it is a minimally invasive procedure, meaning it does not require a large incision or general anesthesia. This reduces the risk of complications and shortens recovery time, allowing patients to return home the same day as their procedure. This is a significant advantage over amputation, which requires a longer hospital stay, extensive rehabilitation, and a lifetime of adjustment to living with a prosthetic limb.

The success rate of PTA in preventing amputation varies depending on the severity of the circulation problem and the underlying condition that is causing it. For patients with less severe circulation problems, PTA has been shown to be highly effective, with a success rate of up to 90%. For patients with more severe problems, the success rate is lower, but it still provides hope for patients who have been told that amputation is their only option.

PTA can also be used in combination with other treatments, such as stent placement or atherectomy, to further improve the blood flow in the affected area. This approach, known as endovascular therapy, provides a more comprehensive treatment plan that addresses multiple aspects of the circulation problem.

One limitation of PTA is that it is not suitable for all patients, particularly those with diabetes or kidney problems. These patients may require more extensive treatment or amputation to prevent potentially life-threatening complications.

Despite its limitations, PTA remains a valuable tool in the fight against amputation. It provides hope to patients who have been told that they have no option but to lose a limb, and it has the potential to improve the quality of life for many people. The procedure is widely available and can be performed by vascular surgeons or interventional radiologists, making it a viable option for many patients with circulation problems.

In conclusion, Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that shows promise in preventing amputation in patients with circulation problems. It is a safe and effective alternative to amputation and provides hope to patients who have been told that they have no other option. While it may not be suitable for all patients, it remains an important tool in the fight against amputation, and its success rate continues to improve as technology advances.",1
190,"Whole Foods closes San Francisco flagship store after one year, citing worker safety","Whole Foods closes San Francisco flagship store after one year, citing worker safety

SAN FRANCISCO - Whole Foods Market has announced the closure of its San Francisco flagship store located at the intersection of California and Powell streets.

The store, boasting over 50,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space, opened in 2019 with much fanfare, featuring a rooftop bar and expansive prepared foods section. However, less than a year later, the store has closed its doors citing worker safety concerns.

In a statement released by the company, Whole Foods said, ""Closing this location was not a decision we made lightly, but the safety of our team members and customers is our top priority. We have determined that the building's structure and infrastructure pose significant risks that cannot be addressed without a lengthy and costly repair process.""

Employees at the store voiced their concerns over the building's safety issues, many claiming they felt unsafe working in the store.

""I've worked in retail for a long time, and I've never seen anything like this before,"" said Marissa, a former Whole Foods employee who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. ""The building was just falling apart. There were leaks everywhere, and the floors were uneven. I was always worried about something collapsing or someone getting hurt.""

The closure of Whole Foods' flagship store is a significant blow to the San Francisco community, as the store was seen as a vital part of the city's revitalization efforts aimed at bringing back consumers and foot traffic to downtown areas.

""The loss of the Whole Foods store is a significant setback for our city, which has been working hard to attract and retain businesses,"" said San Francisco Mayor London Breed in a statement. ""We are committed to working with Whole Foods and other businesses to ensure that they have the support they need to continue operating safely and successfully in San Francisco.""

Whole Foods' decision to close the store has also raised concerns about the broader impact on the company's business strategy. The upscale grocery chain has long been known for its focus on building large, iconic stores in high-traffic areas, with the California and Powell location being one of the company's most ambitious projects.

However, the closure of the flagship store suggests that Whole Foods is rethinking its strategy in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has fundamentally changed the way consumers shop for groceries and other retail items.

""We are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis that has forced us to fundamentally rethink our approach to retail,"" said John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market. ""The decision to close our San Francisco flagship store was not an easy one, but we believe it is the right one given the current circumstances.""

The closure of Whole Foods' San Francisco location comes as the company is facing increased competition from other retailers, including Amazon-owned grocery chain Amazon Go and delivery services like Instacart and Postmates. These companies have been rapidly expanding their presence in the grocery market, offering customers new options for convenient, low-cost grocery shopping.

Whole Foods has responded to these threats by investing in new technology and expanding its online offerings. The company has also launched new initiatives aimed at attracting younger, more price-conscious customers, including a program that offers discounts to Amazon Prime members and a line of private-label products marketed under the name ""365.""

Despite these efforts, Whole Foods' sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, raising concerns about the company's ability to compete in a rapidly evolving grocery market.

The closure of the San Francisco flagship store is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the company's financial performance, as the store was still in the early stages of its development. However, the closure sends a signal that Whole Foods is experiencing significant challenges as it tries to adapt to the changing consumer landscape.

The company's decision to prioritize worker safety over profits is likely to be applauded by labor advocates, who have long criticized Whole Foods for its treatment of employees. The company has faced numerous allegations of worker mistreatment and retaliation, including claims that it has punished employees for union organizing and fired workers for raising safety concerns.

""Whole Foods should be commended for prioritizing the safety of its workers over short-term profits,"" said Rebecca Reindel, safety and health director at the AFL-CIO. ""All workers deserve to have safe and healthy workplaces, and we hope to see more companies follow Whole Foods' lead in prioritizing safety over profit.""

The announcement of the San Francisco store closure comes as Whole Foods faces increased scrutiny over its safety practices in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has come under fire for its handling of worker safety during the crisis, with employees across the country staging protests and walkouts to demand better protections and compensation.

Whole Foods has responded to these concerns by implementing new safety measures, including mandatory mask-wearing and social distancing policies. The company has also provided workers with additional paid time off and hazard pay.

Despite these efforts, employees and labor advocates say that Whole Foods' response to the pandemic has been insufficient, pointing to the many workers who have contracted COVID-19 on the job.

""The closure of the San Francisco store is a stark reminder of the risks that workers face every day in the retail and grocery industries,"" said Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. ""Whole Foods and other companies must do more to protect workers from the many hazards they face, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.""

The closure of Whole Foods' flagship store in San Francisco is a significant development for the company and the broader retail industry. The move suggests that Whole Foods is rethinking its business strategy in light of the ongoing pandemic and increasing competition from new players in the grocery market.

For employees at the San Francisco store, the closure is a bittersweet ending to a difficult year. While many are relieved that they will no longer have to work in a building that they believe was unsafe, they are also sad to see the store go.

""I loved working at Whole Foods, and I loved the people I worked with,"" said Marissa. ""It's just a shame that the building wasn't safe enough to keep it open.""",1

192,"Access to reproductive health care has become more challenging for women in the US, study shows","Access to reproductive health care has become more challenging for women in the United States, according to a new study conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health.

The study found that despite advances in medical technology and expanding access to health care in general, women still face numerous barriers to accessing reproductive health care services, including abortion and contraceptive services.

This is a concerning trend, especially given the current political climate in the US, where women's reproductive rights have been under attack in recent years. The study highlights the urgent need for policymakers to take action to ensure that all women have access to the full range of reproductive health care services they need, regardless of their income, location or other factors.

In this article, we will explore the findings of the Guttmacher study and what they mean for women's health care in the US.

Studying the challenges to reproductive health care access in the US

The Guttmacher Institute conducted a study on the challenges faced by women seeking reproductive health care services in the US. The study was based on a survey of over 2,500 women, aged 15-49, from across the country. The survey aimed to identify the major factors that restrict women's access to reproductive health care services.

The results of the survey show that women face a range of barriers to accessing reproductive health services. One of the most significant barriers is geography, with many women living in areas where there are no reproductive health care providers. This is particularly true for women living in rural areas, where there are often few or no health care facilities.

Another major barrier is cost, with many women unable to afford the cost of reproductive health care services, including abortion and contraception. This is especially problematic for low-income women, who may not have access to affordable health insurance or other forms of financial support.

The study also found that women face a range of social and cultural barriers to accessing reproductive health care services. Many women are intimidated by the stigma surrounding abortion and contraception, and feel ashamed or embarrassed about seeking care. Others may face pressure from family members or partners who oppose the use of contraception or abortion.

These barriers to reproductive health care access are a serious concern, as they prevent women from accessing the care they need to maintain their health and wellbeing.

The impact of political action on reproductive health care in the US

The Guttmacher study also highlights the impact of political action on women's reproductive health care access in the US. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort by conservative lawmakers to restrict women's access to reproductive health care services, particularly abortion.

For example, a number of states have passed laws in recent years imposing onerous regulations on abortion providers, making it more difficult for them to operate. Other states have attempted to ban abortion outright, with laws that would criminalize the procedure even in cases of rape or incest.

These laws have had a significant impact on women's access to reproductive health care services in affected states. Many clinics have been forced to close their doors due to the increased regulatory burden and the threat of criminal prosecution. This has made it more difficult for women to access abortion services, leaving them with fewer options and potentially putting their health and safety at risk.

The study also found that the availability of contraceptive services has been affected by political action in the US. In particular, the Trump administration has sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, which requires insurance plans to cover contraceptive services at no cost to the patient.

If the mandate is repealed, many women could lose access to affordable contraceptive services, making it more difficult for them to prevent unintended pregnancy and maintain their reproductive health.

Taking action to improve access to reproductive health care in the US

The findings of the Guttmacher study demonstrate the urgent need for policymakers to take action to improve women's access to reproductive health care services in the US. This will require a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers that women face, including:

1. Improving geographic access to reproductive health care providers: Efforts to expand access to reproductive health care services must focus on ensuring that women in all regions of the US have access to care. This may require the establishment of new clinics or the expansion of existing ones to more rural areas.

2. Addressing the cost of reproductive health care services: Policymakers should work to ensure that all women have access to affordable reproductive health care services, regardless of their income level. This may involve expanding Medicaid coverage for reproductive health services or creating state-based reproductive health insurance programs.

3. Addressing social and cultural barriers to reproductive health care access: Efforts to reduce stigma around abortion and contraception are essential to improving women's access to reproductive health care services. This may involve supporting outreach programs that educate women about the full range of reproductive health care services available to them.

4. Protecting women's reproductive rights: Policymakers must work to protect women's access to abortion and other reproductive health care services from attacks by conservative lawmakers. This may involve challenging unconstitutional laws in court or passing new laws that protect women's reproductive rights.

5. Ensuring access to comprehensive sex education: Access to comprehensive sex education is crucial for promoting women's reproductive health and preventing unintended pregnancy. Policymakers should support initiatives to expand access to sex education programs in schools and community centers.

Overall, the Guttmacher study shows that access to reproductive health care services remains a significant challenge for many women in the US. Policymakers must take action to address the various barriers that women face, to ensure that all women have access to the care they need to maintain their health and wellbeing. Failure to act on this issue could have serious consequences for women's health and their ability to control their own reproductive lives.",1
193,"'Paint' feels like a trailer in search of a movie, with Owen Wilson as a Bob Ross-type artist","""Paint"" Feels Like a Trailer in Search of a Movie, With Owen Wilson as a Bob Ross-Type Artist.

For years, Owen Wilson has established himself as a talented actor with a natural charm and wit that always seems to win over audiences. He’s been a part of many notable films, including his collaborations with Wes Anderson in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" as well as comedic hits such as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Zoolander."" But with ""Paint,"" Wilson takes on a new role as an artist, specifically as a Bob Ross-type figure who becomes a viral sensation on social media. While there are moments of humor and heart in the film, overall it feels like a trailer in search of a movie, lacking a clear direction and focus.

The film begins with Wilson's character, named Michael, as a struggling artist who works at a hardware store. He's been largely unsuccessful in his career, and his relationship with his girlfriend is starting to fracture. However, he finds solace in painting and spends his free time creating landscapes with his own unique style, one that he's been perfecting for years. But when Michael becomes the unexpected star of a viral video, his life changes dramatically as he gains fame and fortune, only to lose sight of what really matters.

There are moments in ""Paint"" that showcase Wilson's natural talent for humor and likability. His portrayal of Michael is understated and subtle, conveying a quiet sense of desperation that's relatable and endearing. Michael's relationship with his girlfriend, played by actress Judy Greer, is a highlight of the film, as it showcases the ups and downs of a struggling couple trying to make a life work together. The chemistry between Wilson and Greer is palpable and adds a layer of depth to the overall story.

But as the film progresses, it becomes clear that ""Paint"" is not entirely sure what it wants to be. The focus on Michael's rise to social media fame feels like a thinly veiled critique of our current attention-seeking culture, but it's not explored deeply enough to provide any real commentary. There are also multiple storylines that are introduced but never fully developed, such as Michael's strained relationship with his brother or the suggestion that Michael may have a drinking problem.

The film's attempts to offer meaningful insights into the art world similarly fall short. Michael's paintings are often highlighted as being unique and special, but there is no explanation given for why this is the case beyond the catch-all explanation of them being ""different."" The art world is presented as superficial and judgmental, but this isn't explored in any depth, either. The most we get are glimpses of Michael fielding social media comments that range from supportive to cruel, but this ultimately feels like surface-level commentary.

The portrayal of Michael as a Bob Ross-type figure also feels underdeveloped. While it's clear that the film is meant to be a homage to Ross, the television artist who hosted ""The Joy of Painting"" from 1983-1994, there's little attention paid to Ross's iconic style beyond Michael's frequent mentions of him. It's not until the end of the film that we get a glimpse of Michael actually painting in a way that resembles Ross, but this feels too little, too late. The film would have been more effective had it leaned into this aspect of the story more, exploring the ways in which Ross's philosophy of art can still be relevant today.

Despite these shortcomings, ""Paint"" is not without its moments of charm. Wilson's performance is enjoyable throughout, and there are a few scenes that stick out as particularly memorable, including one in which Michael goes on a date with a fan who has commissioned him to paint a portrait. The sequence is funny and sweet, showcasing Wilson's comedic timing and highlighting the absurdity of Michael's newfound fame.

Ultimately, though, ""Paint"" feels like a missed opportunity. The film hints at interesting questions about the nature of art and fame in the digital age, but it never quite delves deep enough to offer any real insight. Instead, the movie meanders from one storyline to the next, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled. It's a shame, as there was clearly potential for a more thoughtful and nuanced exploration of these themes. As it stands, ""Paint"" feels like a trailer for a more interesting movie that was never made. 

In conclusion, it’s clear that Owen Wilson is a talented actor and comedian, but the direction provided for him in ""Paint"" left something to be desired. The film set up an interesting premise but failed to deliver on its promises, leaving the audience feeling incomplete. Perhaps with a more defined focus and a deeper exploration of its themes, ""Paint"" could have been a more memorable film. As it stands, it feels like a wasted opportunity.",1
194,Amazon will charge customers a fee for some UPS returns,"In a move that is sure to ruffle some feathers, Amazon has announced that it will begin charging customers a fee for some UPS returns. The new policy will apply to items that are deemed to be ""heavy"" or ""bulky,"" which typically means they cannot be shipped via UPS's standard service. While the move is sure to be unpopular with some customers, Amazon says it is necessary to offset the increased costs associated with shipping such items.

Under the new policy, which is set to take effect on October 2nd, customers will be charged a fee of $4.99 for each return of a ""heavy"" or ""bulky"" item that is made using UPS. The policy will apply to items that weigh 20 pounds or more, or that have a dimensional weight of 40 pounds or more. These types of items often require special handling, which can be costly for retailers like Amazon.

The fee will only apply to returns that are initiated by the customer, not to returns that are necessary due to a defect or other issue with the item. Amazon says that the fee will be deducted from the refund amount for the item, so customers will not have to pay anything out of pocket.

The move is likely to be seen as a way for Amazon to shift some of the costs of returns onto its customers. Returns can be a major expense for online retailers, not just in terms of shipping costs, but also in terms of the processing and restocking of returned items. In recent years, many retailers have started to implement return fees as a way of offsetting these costs.

Amazon has been no exception to this trend. The company already charges fees for certain types of returns, including those that are made outside of the return window or for items that are damaged or missing parts. However, this new fee marks the first time that Amazon has specifically targeted ""heavy"" or ""bulky"" items for a return fee.

The move is sure to be controversial among Amazon's customers, many of whom have come to expect free and easy returns from the online retailer. In recent years, Amazon has made it easier than ever for customers to return items, offering free returns on millions of eligible items and providing customers with prepaid return labels for easy shipping. However, with this new fee, some customers may feel that Amazon is no longer living up to its promise of hassle-free returns.

Amazon, for its part, says that the fee is necessary in order to keep prices low for all customers. The company notes that the costs of shipping and handling heavy or bulky items can be significant, and that passing some of these costs onto customers is a way of keeping prices low for everyone.

""We know that our customers value convenience and simplicity, especially when it comes to returns,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. ""However, the costs associated with shipping and handling heavy or bulky items are significant, and we feel that it is fair to share some of these costs with our customers. By doing so, we can continue to offer low prices on a wide range of products, while still providing customers with the convenience of easy returns.""

The move is also likely to be seen as a way for Amazon to shore up its relationship with UPS, which has recently been strained due to an influx of packages from e-commerce retailers. In recent years, UPS has struggled to keep up with the volume of packages being shipped from companies like Amazon, leading to delays and frustration for both customers and retailers. This new policy may be a way for Amazon to ease the burden on UPS, by reducing the number of heavy or bulky items that are shipped through the carrier.

Some analysts, however, are skeptical that the fee will have much of an impact on Amazon's bottom line. The company has a large and loyal customer base, many of whom are willing to pay for the convenience of shopping online. While the fee may be unpopular in the short term, it is unlikely to drive customers away from Amazon in significant numbers.

""I don't think this is going to be a huge deal for Amazon,"" says Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research. ""Yes, some customers will be upset, but the vast majority of people who shop on Amazon are loyal and will continue to shop there, even if they have to pay a fee for some returns.""

Overall, Amazon's new return fee is likely to be a tough pill for some customers to swallow. However, it is important to remember that the company is not alone in charging fees for returns. Many retailers, both online and offline, have implemented similar policies in recent years, in order to offset the costs of processing and restocking returned items. While it may be an inconvenience for some, the fee is ultimately a reflection of the underlying costs of the e-commerce business, and a reminder that even the most customer-friendly retailers are not immune to the economic realities of the industry.",1
195,Three major risks that have the banking industry on edge,"The global banking industry is facing significant challenges with a number of risks that are causing deep concern. The Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical instability, and digital disruption have only added to the industry's pre-existing challenges. 

These three critical risks are not only reshaping the banking industry, but they are putting the very existence of some banks at stake. In this article, we'll discuss these three major risks that are keeping the banking industry on the edge. 

1. Pandemic-Driven Financial Uncertainty

The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy and is arguably one of the most significant risks that the banking industry is currently facing. As countries imposed lockdowns and businesses were forced to close, banks were faced with a sudden loss of income and a surge in loan defaults.

The uncertainty caused by the pandemic has created financial stress for banks as they grapple with declining revenue, increasing loan delinquencies, and low interest rates. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that this financial stress will lead to a global recession that could be worse than the 2008 financial crisis.

The pandemic has also changed the way people conduct their financial transactions. The shift towards digital banking has accelerated, with customers showing a preference for digital channels to conduct their banking. This shift towards digital banking has put traditional banks at a disadvantage, as they scramble to keep up with the fintech industry's innovation.

A reduced demand for cash, an increased demand for digital payments, and the widespread use of contactless payment options have further threatened traditional banking structures. If these trends continue, banks would need to adapt in a quick and efficient manner to be able to survive financially.

2. Geopolitical Instability

Geopolitical instability is another significant risk that the banking industry is facing. The rise of nationalism, trade wars, and potential military conflicts have seriously impacted the outlook of the global economy. The instability of the economies of the US, Russia, China, and Europe has led to fluctuations in the global financial market that has left a significant impact on the banking sector.

Sanctions and trade wars between countries have forced banks to close down some of their operations, divest from certain markets, and reassess their risk management strategies. The implementation of additional security protocols, in-line with updated regulatory guidelines, has necessitated further investment in compliance steps and heightened the cost of operations.

In addition, Brexit has become a source of geopolitical tension between the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU). The uncertainty surrounding Brexit has impacted the UK economy and its financial sector. If the UK fails to secure an agreement with the EU, it could lead to a potential inability for banks to operate normally, which could severely impact the global financial system, specifically in Europe.

3. Digital Disruption 

Digital disruption has been one of the significant risks that the banking industry has faced over the past few years. The rise of fintech companies and digital banks has led to agile competition that has resulted in a dilution of customer loyalty towards traditional banking institutions. 

Fintech companies like Square, Stripe, and Lending Tree have disrupted traditional banking business models, by offering compelling financial products and sleek user experiences. Digital banks like Monzo and Starling Bank have also raced ahead of their traditional bank counterparts, by offering end-to-end digital experiences for customers.

Digital disruption has also created new security threats, such as data breaches, cyber-attacks, and fraud. The rise in crypto-currencies has given rise to new forms of financial crimes, like money laundering and terrorist financing. These risks are exacerbated by the increasing reliance on technology and the potential dire consequences of critical data and infrastructure being compromised.

The rapid shift towards digital banking is not without a downside. The lack of physical branches and scarcity of human interaction has altered the scope of the traditional bank-customer relationship. The increased anonymity offered by digital banking systems raises concerns of fraud and money laundering, putting traditional banks at a disadvantage. 

To address these threats, traditional banks can either partner with fintech companies to regain competitive advantage, or invest heavily in technological infrastructure to match the offerings of digital-only institutions. However, lower-cost digital-only banks have been able to offer products with more favorable rates and loyalty programmes to customers.

Conclusion

The banking industry is facing significant challenges as a result of the global pandemic, geopolitical instability, and the ongoing digital disruption. The industry must adapt and evolve to manage these risks and thrive in a changing environment. 

The impact of Covid-19 is likely to continue in the coming years, exacerbating financial uncertainty for banks. The potential impact of geopolitical instability, such as the tension between the US and China, or the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, will continue to loom over the banking sector. Digital disruption is likely to continue to grow, posing more complex security and compliance risks.

To remain viable, banks must evaluate and reassess their business models, with a view to striking a balance between their traditional functions and the new trends in the industry. The successful adoption of technology to assist operational activities and improve customer experience will undoubtedly play a significant role in the direction banking would take post-2020.",1
196,Kentucky governor speaks after bank shooting,"Following the tragic shooting at a bank in Kentucky on Wednesday, Governor Matt Bevin spoke out about the tragedy and expressed his heartfelt condolences to the victims and their families.

While the motive for the shooting remains unclear, officials have stated that there is no indication of a larger threat to the community.

This tragic incident serves as a sobering reminder of the need for stricter gun laws and better access to mental health care. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families during this difficult time.",1
197,More than 100  temperature records could be broken across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday,"As the summer is getting hotter day by day, regional temperature records could be broken across the Midwest and Northeast this week. National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley predicts that more than 100 high-temperature records may be set in some of the largest urban areas in the eastern region of the country. Many cities including New York, Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., could experience their warmest temperatures of the year so far. This article aims to shed light on why the temperature is soaring high this time of year and how it could impact the lives of citizens in these areas.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the burning of fossil fuels by humans has elevated the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun and cause global warming. The planet's average surface temperature has risen by about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 1800s. The rate of warming has accelerated in recent decades, and 19 of the 20 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. The increase in annual temperatures has led to a rise in sea levels, more intense extreme weather events, and changing ecosystems. The warmer-than-average temperatures predicted this week in the Eastern United States region are another reminder of global warming's dangerous consequences.

""Any time you have these heatwaves, they're a reminder that climate change is real, and it's impacting our daily lives,"" said Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist and deputy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's Science Center. ""It's playing out in ways that were predicted by scientists decades ago.""

The Northeast and Midwest regions that are expected to experience high temperatures this week can take precautions to stay safe and comfortable. Here are a few measures that individuals can take this week to avoid heat stress and other health problems.

1. Stay indoors
The best way to avoid heat stress is to stay indoors with air conditioning if possible. If your home doesn't have AC, try to visit public places that do, like a mall or library, or go to a friend's home that has air conditioning.

2. Drink enough water
It is essential to stay hydrated during the hot summer months. Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, to maintain your body's water level. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can lead to dehydration.

3. Dress appropriately
Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing made from breathable materials such as cotton or linen. Dress in light colors to reflect the sun's rays and keep yourself cool.

4. Check on the elderly and disabled
Heatwaves can be especially harmful to the elderly, disabled, and those with pre-existing medical conditions. It's important to check on these individuals regularly to ensure they're safe.

5. Avoid being outside during peak heat hours
While being outside during the summer is enjoyable, it's essential to limit your exposure to the sun during peak heat hours. Avoid going outside between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm. If you must go outside during peak hours, take frequent breaks in the shade or an air-conditioned building.

The extreme heat could also impact infrastructure, such as power plants and transportation systems. As temperatures rise, electricity demand increases as people turn up their air conditioning or fans. More demand for electricity could trigger power outages, affecting homes, offices, and other buildings. Transportation systems, including trains and buses, may also experience delays or cancellations as tracks expand and electricity systems struggle to meet demand.

""Extreme heat like this can make infrastructure fail in unexpected ways,"" Knowlton said. ""Power transformers, roads, and train tracks can all suffer when they're exposed to these kinds of intense heat.""

The Midwest has already experienced its first brush with unusual heat this year, with temperatures soaring way above normal in June. In Minnesota, residents saw the warmest fourth of July weekend temperatures in over 100 years. In addition, Wisconsin saw temperatures hit ""dangerous"" levels, as the heat index reached between 100 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

With the continuing trend of heatwaves, it's important for Americans to take climate change seriously and support efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing our collective carbon footprint, we can work to prevent even more dangerous heatwaves and other climate-related disasters. 

""Like avoiding COVID, we need to engage in public health mitigation strategies to make sure we're protecting ourselves and each other from heat illness,"" Knowlton said. ""We need to be doing the same thing when it comes to addressing climate change. The science is clear; we need to act now."" 

In conclusion, people in the Midwest and Northeast can brace themselves for a hot and humid week. High temperatures can pose a real threat to public health, infrastructure, and the environment. It's essential for individuals to take measures to protect themselves during extreme heat and to promote policies to combat climate change.",1
198,What we know about the fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker as grand jury considers the case,"The fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker on July 6, 2021, has raised questions and concerns in the community of Ferguson, Missouri, and beyond. As a grand jury considers whether there is sufficient evidence to charge the officer involved, we take a closer look at what we know about the case so far.

Background

Jayland Walker, 23, was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop in Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis. According to the Ferguson Police Department, officers pulled over a vehicle for a routine traffic violation. Walker was a passenger in the vehicle.

During the stop, officers reportedly discovered that there was a warrant out for Walker's arrest on charges of unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest. The officers attempted to take Walker into custody, but he allegedly resisted and a struggle ensued.

In a statement released shortly after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Department said that ""during the struggle, the suspect produced a firearm, resulting in an officer-involved shooting."" Walker was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Officer Involved

The officer involved in the shooting has been identified as Officer Samuel Wilson, who has been with the Ferguson Police Department for three years. Wilson has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

According to the Ferguson Police Department, Officer Wilson is white. Walker was Black.

Investigation

The shooting is being investigated by the St. Louis County Police Department's Bureau of Crimes Against Persons. The department has declined to release any details of the investigation, citing an ongoing grand jury proceeding.

It is unclear at this time whether any video footage of the incident exists or whether any bystanders or other officers witnessed the shooting.

Community Response

The fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker has sparked protests and calls for justice in Ferguson and beyond. Community members have expressed frustration and anger over what they see as yet another instance of police violence against Black people.

""It's just another reminder of how deeply ingrained racism is in this country,"" said Ferguson resident Maria Williams. ""It's exhausting, but we can't give up the fight for justice.""

The Ferguson Police Department has acknowledged the community's concerns and has pledged to be transparent and cooperative with the investigation.

""We understand that the community is hurting and we want to do everything we can to ensure that justice is served,"" said Ferguson Police Chief Marcus Banks in a statement. ""We are committed to working with the St. Louis County Police Department to find out what happened and to hold those responsible accountable.""

Legal Analysis

As the grand jury considers whether to charge Officer Samuel Wilson in the shooting of Jayland Walker, legal experts say the outcome of the case may depend on whether the officer had reason to fear for his life.

""In cases like this, the question always comes down to whether the officer had a reasonable belief that he or someone else was in imminent danger,"" said legal analyst Sarah Smith. ""If he did, then the shooting may be justified under the law.""

However, Smith notes that the circumstances surrounding the shooting are unclear at this time, and there may be other factors that come into play.

""Depending on what the investigation reveals, there could be questions about whether the officers followed proper protocols during the stop, or whether they used excessive force,"" Smith said.

Potential Charges

If Officer Samuel Wilson is charged in the shooting of Jayland Walker, the charges could range from manslaughter to murder. The exact charges will depend on the findings of the grand jury investigation and the evidence presented.

""If the grand jury believes that the shooting was intentional and premeditated, then Officer Wilson could be charged with murder,"" said Smith. ""If they believe it was a more spur-of-the-moment decision, then the charges may be closer to manslaughter.""

Potential Outcome

The outcome of the grand jury proceeding is impossible to predict at this time, but legal experts say that if Officer Samuel Wilson is charged, it is likely that the case will go to trial.

""In cases like this, where there is such a high level of public interest and scrutiny, it is unlikely that the prosecutor will choose not to pursue charges if the grand jury recommends them,"" said Smith.

However, even if charges are filed and the case goes to trial, there is still no guarantee of a conviction.

""Police officers have a lot of legal protections when it comes to the use of force, and it can be difficult to convict them in these kinds of cases,"" said Smith. ""But it's important to remember that the legal system is designed to ensure a fair trial, and we have to trust that justice will be served.""

Conclusion

The fatal police shooting of Jayland Walker has once again highlighted the issue of police violence against Black people in America. As a grand jury considers whether to charge the officer involved, we can only hope that the investigation and any subsequent legal proceedings are conducted fairly and impartially.

It is incumbent upon all of us to demand accountability and transparency from our law enforcement agencies, and to work towards a more just and equitable society where incidents like this one do not occur. Only then can we truly claim to have a system of justice that works for all.",1
199,A little-known drug brought billions to Syria's coffers. Now it's a bargaining chip,"I am sorry, but writing a 10997-word article is beyond my capacity as an AI language model. It would also exceed the attention span of most readers. Nonetheless, I can provide a shorter version of the requested article:

Headline: A little-known drug brought billions to Syria's coffers. Now it's a bargaining chip.

Syria's civil war has brought untold suffering to its people, but one little-known commodity has kept the country's economy afloat amid the chaos -- captagon. The amphetamine-like drug is a popular stimulant in the Middle East and has been produced in clandestine labs in Syria for decades. In recent years, it has become the country's most lucrative export, bringing in billions of dollars and fueling the war effort. But as the conflict enters its tenth year, captagon has become a bargaining chip in the international community's efforts to end the bloodshed.

Captagon, also known as fenethylline, was first developed in the 1960s as a treatment for hyperactivity and depression. It was later banned in many countries due to its addictive properties and links to mental illness. However, it remained legal in some parts of the Middle East, where it was used as a recreational drug and a performance enhancer by truck drivers, soldiers, and students cramming for exams.

In the early 2000s, Syrian entrepreneurs discovered that they could produce captagon cheaply and easily using cold and flu medicines, caffeine, and other chemicals. They set up makeshift labs in the country's lawless areas, where there were few controls on drug production and trafficking. By 2010, captagon had become one of Syria's top exports, with estimates suggesting that it accounted for up to 75% of the country's illegal drug trade.

The profits from captagon flowed into the pockets of warlords, smugglers, and the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, which used the funds to buy weapons and pay fighters. The drug also played a role in propping up the Syrian pound, which has lost 99% of its value since the start of the war. Some experts suggest that captagon was a key factor in the Assad regime's ability to withstand years of sanctions and military pressure.

But captagon's hidden role in the war became more widely known as the conflict dragged on. In 2015, French authorities seized a shipment of 84 million captagon pills in Beirut, Lebanon, bound for Saudi Arabia. The pills had been manufactured in Syria and were worth an estimated $1.2 billion. The following year, Turkish authorities seized a haul of 11 million captagon pills in the southern city of Mersin, believed to have originated in Syria.

The global spotlight on captagon coincided with increased pressure on the Assad regime from the international community. In 2015, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2254, which called for a ceasefire in Syria and a political transition away from the Assad regime. The resolution also included provisions for combating the illicit drug trade and preventing the diversion of chemical precursors to drug production.

Since then, captagon has become part of the bargaining process in negotiations aimed at ending the war. The UN and other Western governments have pressured the Syrian regime and its allies, Russia and Iran, to crack down on captagon production and trafficking. In return, they have offered concessions on sanctions relief and diplomatic recognition.

Russia, which has backed the Assad regime throughout the war, has been accused of being complicit in the captagon trade. In 2020, The New York Times reported that Russian military officials had facilitated the production and trafficking of captagon by allowing it to be smuggled out of Syria on Russian planes. Russian officials denied the allegations.

The fate of captagon has become intertwined with the broader struggle for power and influence in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, which has been a major destination for captagon shipments, has accused Iran of using the drug to fund its proxies in the region. Iran, in turn, has accused Saudi Arabia of using the drug to destabilize its government.

For the Syrian people, the captagon trade has been a mixed blessing. While it has provided jobs and income for many, it has also fueled addiction and crime. The long-term health effects of captagon use are largely unknown, but many users report a range of physical and mental side effects.

As the war continues to rage in Syria, the fate of captagon remains uncertain. Its producers and traffickers continue to operate with impunity, while governments and international organizations struggle to find a way to curb its use as a source of funding for the war. For the people of Syria, captagon is just one more reminder of the countless ways in which the conflict has upended their lives.",1
200,Hamlin helps launch emergency cardiac response bill,"NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin is not just a racer, but also an advocate for cardiac health. Hamlin recently helped launch a new bill to improve emergency cardiac care across the country.

The bill, known as the Emergency Medical Services Quality Improvement Act of 2021, was introduced by Republican Congressman Richard Hudson of North Carolina. The legislation aims to standardize the quality and delivery of emergency medical services, specifically focused on heart attack and cardiac arrest response.

Hamlin, who has suffered from heart-related issues in the past, was an instrumental voice in the creation of the bill. He partnered with Hudson to help raise awareness and push for the legislation to become a reality.

“When it comes to emergency cardiac care, time is of the essence,” Hamlin said in a statement. “Having a consistent level of care and response rate across the country will save lives and ensure that those who suffer from heart-related emergencies are given the best possible chance at survival.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 655,000 deaths each year. Quick and efficient emergency care can be the difference between life and death for those suffering from heart ailments.

The Emergency Medical Services Quality Improvement Act of 2021 would require the Department of Health and Human Services to develop quality measures and a reporting system for emergency medical services related to heart attacks and cardiac arrest. The bill would also provide grants to states to improve the quality of their emergency medical responses.

Congressman Hudson praised Hamlin’s involvement in the creation of the bill, stating, “I am grateful for Denny’s dedication to this effort and we cannot thank him enough for his leadership on this critical issue.”

Hamlin is not the only NASCAR driver to be affected by heart-related issues. Seven-time NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt suffered a fatal heart attack during a race in 2001. Hamlin’s personal experience and the tragic loss of a fellow racer spurred him to take action and advocate for improved emergency cardiac care.

The Emergency Medical Services Quality Improvement Act of 2021 has yet to be voted on by Congress, but Hamlin and Hudson remain optimistic that it will be passed into law in the near future, potentially saving countless lives in the process.",1
201,Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,"It's that time of the year again when millions of Americans pull up their sleeves and get ready to file their taxes. If you are one of the many who have put it off till the last minute, don't panic. In this article, we'll break down everything you need to know before filing your taxes and ensure that you're ready before the April 15 deadline.

Gather your paperwork

Before sitting down to prepare your tax return, gather all your paperwork. This includes your W-2 form, 1099s, receipts for deductible expenses such as charitable donations, mortgage interest, and medical expenses. If you have investments, you'll also need to gather forms such as 1099-DIV and 1099-B.

Getting organized at the outset can save you time and money down the line. It can also ensure that you don't forget a form or document when filing your taxes, which can lead to penalties and interest.

Choose the tax preparation method that works best for you

There are numerous ways to file your taxes, and the best method depends on your financial situation and preferences. Some people prefer to use a tax preparer who can help identify tax-saving opportunities and ensure that everything is filled out accurately. Others prefer to use tax software, which can be cheaper and more convenient for those with simple tax returns.

If you decide to use a tax preparer, make sure to choose a reputable and qualified professional. You may also be eligible for free tax preparation assistance through programs such as Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) or Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE).

Understand your filing options

When filing your taxes, you have three options - file electronically through IRS e-file, file a paper return or use a tax preparer who participates in IRS e-file.

Filing electronically is usually the quickest and most convenient option. You can use tax software, a tax preparer or the IRS's Free File program to e-file your tax return. You can also pay your taxes electronically using the IRS's Direct Pay tool or a credit or debit card.

If you prefer to file a paper return, you'll need to send it to the address listed on the IRS website. Make sure to double-check the address, as different forms have different addresses.

Pay any taxes owed

If you owe taxes, the April 15 deadline is also the deadline to pay them. If you can't pay the full amount owed, you have options. You can set up an installment plan with the IRS, which allows you to pay off your taxes over time. You can also request an offer in compromise, which allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than what is owed.

It's important to note that failing to pay your taxes can lead to penalties and interest. The failure-to-pay penalty is 0.5% of your unpaid taxes per month, up to a maximum of 25%. Interest is currently 3% per year and compounds daily.

Be aware of tax scams

Tax scams are becoming more common, especially during tax season. Scammers may pretend to be IRS agents via email, phone or even in person, and may ask for personal information or payment for taxes owed.

If you receive a suspicious email or phone call from someone claiming to be an IRS agent, do not respond or provide any personal information. The IRS never initiates contact with taxpayers via email or phone, and they will never ask for payment in the form of gift cards or wire transfers.

Report any suspicious activity to the IRS or the Federal Trade Commission.

Take advantage of tax-saving opportunities

There are a variety of tax-saving opportunities that you should take advantage of when filing your taxes. For example, if you have a traditional IRA, you may be eligible for a tax deduction for contributions made to your account. If you have a Health Savings Account, you may be able to deduct contributions made to that account as well.

Charitable donations can also be tax-deductible, so make sure to keep track of any donations you make throughout the year.

File on time, even if you can't pay

Finally, it's important to remember that even if you can't pay the full amount owed by the April 15 deadline, you should still file your taxes on time. Failing to file your taxes can lead to a failure-to-file penalty, which is 5% of the taxes owed per month, up to a maximum of 25%. This penalty is more costly than the failure-to-pay penalty, so it's better to file on time and set up an installment plan to pay off what you owe.

In conclusion, there's no need to panic if you haven't filed your taxes yet. By following these tips, you can ensure that you're ready before the April 15 deadline and avoid any unnecessary penalties or fees. Happy tax season!",1
202,See SWAT team raid Louisville gunman's home,"In a dramatic and potentially life-saving raid, a SWAT team descended upon the home of the Louisville gunman. The shooter, who has not been named at this time, left two people dead and several others injured in a shooting spree that rocked the city.

The Louisville Metro Police Department, along with members of the SWAT team, coordinated a rapid response, taking the gunman's home by storm in an effort to apprehend the dangerous criminal. The team, fully equipped with assault rifles, protective vests, and helmets, surged through the doors of the home, quickly neutralizing any potential threats inside.

During the operation, investigators seized a large quantity of ammunition, as well as several firearms that they believe the gunman used in the deadly attack. Officials declined to provide further details about the weapons seized, stating that the investigation is ongoing.

The shooter was apprehended without incident, though he reportedly resisted arrest initially. Officers and SWAT team members had to use non-lethal force to subdue the suspect, but no injuries occurred during the takedown.

The bravery and efficiency of the SWAT team undoubtedly saved lives and prevented further bloodshed in the city. The team's rapid response and tactical expertise were critical in neutralizing the threat and bringing the gunman into custody.

Local officials hailed the operation as a success and praised the brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way to protect the public. As the city grapples with this tragedy, residents can take comfort in knowing that law enforcement officials are working diligently to keep them safe.",1
203,Honig says Fox is 'headed for a full-blown journalistic and legal disaster',"CNN legal analyst Elie Honig spoke strongly on Monday about what he called Fox News’ ""irresponsibility,"" saying that the cable news outlet is ""headed for a full-blown journalistic and legal disaster"" for promoting baseless claims of election fraud.

During an appearance on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday, Honig criticized Fox News anchors and guests for repeatedly promoting the idea that President Donald Trump won the November election, despite no credible evidence to support it.

Honig said, ""The Fox News hosts have not only recklessly undermined faith in the electoral process, but they have opened the network up to potential defamation lawsuits. They are spreading conspiracy theories without any evidence or facts to back them up. I think it’s safe to say they are headed for a full-blown journalistic and legal disaster.""

Honig added that Fox News could face enormous legal liabilities if it turns out that their reporting has caused damage to individuals or organizations. He cited the case of voting machine company Smartmatic, which has demanded retractions and threatened legal action against Fox News hosts who have suggested that the company was involved in election fraud.",1
204,What one millennial with phone anxiety did when she stopped texting to stay connected,"As technology has evolved, it has become easier than ever to stay connected to friends and family. Social media and instant messaging apps have made it possible to communicate with loved ones no matter where they are in the world. But for one millennial, the constant communication was becoming overwhelming.

Katie, a 27-year-old software developer, had always been an introvert. She preferred spending most of her time alone rather than socializing, and as a result, was comfortable with being alone with her thoughts. She had always been a latecomer to technology, only recently realizing the power of smartphones, instant messaging and social media. But as she became more and more connected online, she began to feel increasingly anxious.

""I would dread getting messages or notifications,"" she said. ""It felt like I had to constantly be available to everyone, and the pressure was overwhelming.""  It was then that she realized she needed to make a change in order to maintain her mental health and well-being.

Katie decided to take a break from texting and social media for a month. The experience completely changed her perspective on communication and the importance of taking time for oneself.

Initially, Katie was apprehensive about the challenge. She worried about missing important messages and being out of touch with her friends and family. She set up an auto-reply message on her phone to let people know she wouldn't be responding to messages during the next month.

""I was worried that people would take it personally, that they would think I didn't want to talk to them,"" she said. ""But the response was overwhelmingly positive. People were really supportive and understood why I was doing it.""

Without the constant barrage of notifications, Katie quickly realized how much time she had been spending on her phone. ""I would check my phone every five minutes or so, just to see if anyone had messaged me,"" she said. ""But once I stopped doing that, I felt like I had so much more time and energy.""

Katie used the extra time and energy to focus on herself. She started journaling every day, something she hadn't done in years. ""It felt like a release, like I was getting all my thoughts and feelings out on paper,"" she said.

She also started taking long walks in the park near her house. ""I would always have my headphones in and music playing when I went for walks, but without my phone, I was able to really appreciate the world around me,"" she said. ""I noticed things I had never seen before, like the way the sunlight hit the leaves on the trees, or the sound of the birds chirping.""

Katie even started reconnecting with old hobbies, like painting and playing the piano. ""I hadn't touched my piano in months, but without the constant distractions of social media and texting, I found myself gravitating towards it again,"" she said.

The most surprising thing Katie discovered during her month-long hiatus from technology was how much closer she felt to the people in her life. ""Without texting or social media to fall back on, I found myself having more meaningful conversations with my friends and family,"" she said. ""We would call each other or meet up in person, and it felt like we were really present with each other.""

By the end of the month, Katie had a refreshed perspective on communication and the importance of taking time for oneself. ""I realized that it's okay to take a step back from the constant noise of technology and just be present in my own life,"" she said.

While she has resumed texting and social media, Katie now approaches them with a new mindset. ""I try to be more intentional about my use of technology,"" she said. ""I don't check my phone as frequently, and I make sure to take breaks throughout the day where I'm just present in the moment.""

Katie's experience shows that taking time away from technology can help us re-center ourselves and appreciate the present moment. While being connected to the world has its benefits, we must not forget the importance of time spent with ourselves and the people we love. By taking a break from texting and social media, we can gain a new perspective on what truly matters in life.",1
205,Matthew McConaughey has some thoughts on his next role as 'Yellowstone' spinoff stirs interest,"Actor Matthew McConaughey has always been a force to reckon with on the silver screen. From his breakout role in Richard Linklater's iconic comedy ""Dazed and Confused"" to his Oscar-winning performance in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" McConaughey has established himself as one of the most versatile and engaging actors of his generation. But now, as he prepares to take on his next project, McConaughey is feeling the pressure to deliver something truly special.

""I'm excited to get started on this new project,"" McConaughey says, ""but there's no denying that there's a lot of buzz around it. People are already talking about it, and that puts a lot of pressure on me to deliver something that lives up to the hype.""

The project in question is a spinoff of the hit TV series ""Yellowstone,"" which has been one of the most talked-about shows of the past few years. The new series, which is tentatively titled ""6666,"" will focus on the sprawling Texas ranch that was briefly mentioned in the main series. McConaughey is set to star in the series, which is being developed by ""Yellowstone"" creator Taylor Sheridan.

""I've been a big fan of Taylor's work for a long time now,"" McConaughey says. ""And when he approached me with the idea for '6666,' I was immediately intrigued. It's a really interesting project, with a lot of potential, and I'm excited to see where it goes.""

As for what fans can expect from the new series, McConaughey is predictably cagey. ""There's still a lot of work to be done, so it's hard to say exactly what the show will be like,"" he says. ""But I can tell you that it's going to be intense, and it's going to be a wild ride.""

Fans of ""Yellowstone"" know that Sheridan is no stranger to intense and wild storytelling. The main series, which follows the power struggles and turf wars of a Montana cattle ranching family, is widely praised for its gripping drama and stunning visuals. And with McConaughey on board, there's no doubt that ""6666"" will be able to capture some of that same magic.

But for McConaughey, there's more to his involvement in the project than just the opportunity to work with a talented writer and filmmaker. The actor is also deeply invested in the themes and ideas that ""6666"" is set to explore.

""I've always been fascinated by the mythology and history of Texas,"" he says. ""It's a place that's full of contradictions and complexities, and there's a lot of untold stories there. I think that's part of what makes this project so exciting for me – it's a chance to explore some of those stories, and to shed light on the unique culture and legacy of Texas.""

Indeed, McConaughey has always been drawn to roles and projects that allow him to delve into complex characters and ideas. From his turn as the iconic Rust Cohle in the first season of ""True Detective"" to his portrayal of a decidedly unheroic Civil War captain in the recent film ""Free State of Jones,"" the actor has always been willing to tackle challenging material.

""I think part of what I love about acting is the opportunity to explore different perspectives and experiences,"" he says. ""It's a chance to step into someone else's shoes and to see the world through their eyes. And that's a really valuable thing, both as an actor and as a person.""

But even with all the storytelling potential that ""6666"" offers, McConaughey is quick to acknowledge the challenges that come with bringing a new series to life. ""It's always tricky when you're starting from scratch with a new project,"" he says. ""There are a lot of unknowns, and a lot of things that could go wrong. But that's part of the fun of it, too – the challenge of taking something that's just an idea and turning it into a fully realized piece of art.""

And McConaughey is more than up to that challenge. With his well-honed acting chops and his proven ability to tackle tough roles, he's poised to make a major impact on ""6666."" And with the existing fanbase and critical acclaim that ""Yellowstone"" has already garnered, it seems likely that the new series will be an instant hit.

For now, though, McConaughey is focused on the work that lies ahead. ""We're still at the very beginning of this process,"" he says. ""There's still a lot of work to be done before we start shooting. But I'm excited to dive in and start exploring this new world that Taylor has created.""

And as for what he hopes audiences will take away from ""6666,"" McConaughey is characteristically thoughtful. ""I hope that people will see something of themselves in the characters and the stories,"" he says. ""I think that's what great art does – it helps us to understand ourselves and our world a little bit better. And if we can do that with '6666,' then I think we'll have done our job.""

For now, we'll have to wait and see what McConaughey and Sheridan have in store for us with ""6666."" But given their respective talents and the potential of the project, there's no doubt that it will be one of the most highly anticipated new series of the coming years.",1
206,"WHO warns new Omicron spinoff XBB.1.16 is 'one to watch,' but hasn't shown to be more severe","The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning about a potential new strain of the COVID-19 virus named XBB.1.16, which is believed to be a spinoff from the Omicron variant that was first identified in South Africa in November 2021. Although the new strain has not been shown to be more severe than previous variants, the WHO has advised that it is still 'one to watch,' particularly as it continues to spread across different countries.

XBB.1.16 was first identified in Botswana in late November 2021 and has since been found in several other countries, including South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first identified. Initial reports suggest that XBB.1.16 may be more transmissible than previous variants, although the extent of this remains unclear. As yet, there is no evidence to suggest that it causes more severe illness or is less susceptible to vaccination.

The WHO's warning about XBB.1.16 comes as countries around the world continue to struggle with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With case numbers rising once again in many regions, there is growing concern that new variants of the virus could emerge that are more contagious or more dangerous than existing strains. In response to this threat, many governments are ramping up their vaccination efforts and introducing new measures to slow the spread of the virus.

One of the key concerns with the emergence of XBB.1.16 is that it could potentially undermine the effectiveness of existing vaccines. The Omicron variant, which is believed to have originated in South Africa, has already been shown to be less susceptible to some existing vaccines, although it is not yet clear to what extent this will affect their overall efficacy. If XBB.1.16 also proves to be resistant to current vaccines, it could significantly hamper efforts to bring the pandemic under control.

Despite these concerns, however, scientists and public health officials are urging people not to panic. Although the emergence of new variants is worrying, it is a natural part of the evolution of any virus. What is important is that we continue to monitor the situation closely and take effective steps to limit the spread of the virus, including through measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and vaccination campaigns.

The WHO has urged countries to remain vigilant and to step up their efforts to detect and respond to new variants of the virus. This includes building up surveillance systems to monitor the spread of the virus, investing in research to better understand the nature of emerging strains, and developing new vaccines and treatments that can help to protect people against future outbreaks.

The emergence of XBB.1.16 highlights the ongoing challenge that we face in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the progress that has been made in recent months in terms of vaccination and other measures, the virus continues to pose a serious threat to public health and the global economy. As such, it is crucial that we remain vigilant and do everything in our power to keep the virus under control.

One of the key lessons that we can take from this latest development is the importance of international cooperation in dealing with the pandemic. The emergence of XBB.1.16 in Botswana is a reminder that the virus knows no borders, and that we must work together as a global community if we are to overcome this crisis. This includes sharing data and resources, cooperating on vaccine distribution, and providing support and assistance to countries that are experiencing surges in cases or struggling to cope with the pandemic.

Looking ahead, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be a major issue in 2022 and beyond. While the emergence of new variants is a cause for concern, it is important to remember that we have made significant progress in the fight against the virus. Thanks to vaccination campaigns and other measures, we are better equipped than ever to deal with the challenges that lie ahead.

In conclusion, the WHO's warning about the XBB.1.16 strain of the COVID-19 virus is a reminder that the pandemic is far from over. While we should not panic, it is important to remain vigilant and take effective steps to limit the spread of the virus. This includes investing in research to understand the nature of emerging strains, building up surveillance systems to monitor their spread, and developing new vaccines and treatments that can help to protect people against future outbreaks. By working together as a global community, we can overcome this crisis and emerge stronger and more resilient on the other side.",1
207,Israeli forces and Palestinians clash in West Bank,"Israeli forces and Palestinians clashed in the West Bank on Wednesday, marking the latest escalation in the long-running conflict between the two sides.

According to witnesses, the clashes erupted when Israeli forces attempted to remove a Palestinian encampment in the town of Beita, which Palestinians had set up to protest against Israeli settlement expansion in the area.

The Israeli forces reportedly used tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition to disperse the protesters, who responded by throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at the security forces.

The clashes resulted in several injuries on both sides, with reports suggesting that at least 20 Palestinians were injured and two Israeli soldiers were also wounded.

The incident comes amid renewed tensions in the region following Israel's recent decision to legalize settler outposts in the West Bank, a move that the Palestinians have condemned and that they say undermines the prospects of a two-state solution to the conflict.

The clashes in Beita are just the latest in a series of violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank, where tensions have been simmering for decades. The situation is volatile, and it remains unclear how the latest escalation will affect the already fraught relationship between the two sides.",1
208,Sleep apnea and snoring: 8 warning signs to look for,"Sleep apnea and snoring: 8 warning signs to look for

For many people, snoring is just an annoying habit that disrupts their partner's sleep. However, snoring can actually be a sign of a much bigger problem: sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. It can cause serious health problems if left untreated. If you or someone you love snores, here are 8 warning signs that could indicate sleep apnea.

1. Loud snoring

Snoring is the most common warning sign of sleep apnea. If you or your partner snores loudly every night, it could be a sign of sleep apnea. The snoring may be so loud that it wakes you or your partner up at night. Loud snoring is caused by the vibrations of the soft tissue in the throat during sleep.

2. Gasping or choking during sleep

Another common sign of sleep apnea is gasping or choking during sleep. This occurs when the airway becomes blocked and the body has trouble getting enough air. Gasping or choking can be a frightening experience for the person experiencing it and their partner. It is important to seek medical attention if this occurs.

3. Excessive tiredness during the day

One of the most noticeable effects of sleep apnea is excessive tiredness during the day. People with sleep apnea often feel tired and sluggish throughout the day, regardless of how much sleep they got the night before. This is because the body is not getting the restorative sleep it needs at night due to interruptions in breathing.

4. Waking up with a headache

People with sleep apnea often wake up with a headache in the morning. This is because the brain is not getting enough oxygen during sleep. Lack of oxygen causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate, which can lead to headaches.

5. Dry mouth or sore throat in the morning

Another common sign of sleep apnea is waking up with a dry mouth or sore throat in the morning. This occurs because the airway becomes dry and irritated due to breathing interruptions during sleep. If you wake up with a dry mouth or sore throat on a regular basis, it could be a sign of sleep apnea.

6. Difficulty concentrating

People with sleep apnea often have difficulty concentrating during the day. This is because they are not getting restorative sleep at night. Lack of sleep can also affect cognitive function and memory. If you are having trouble concentrating during the day, it may be a sign of sleep apnea.

7. Mood changes

Sleep apnea can also cause mood changes. People with sleep apnea may feel irritable, anxious, or depressed. Lack of sleep can also affect hormones that regulate mood, leading to changes in mood and behavior.

8. High blood pressure

Sleep apnea can also affect blood pressure. People with sleep apnea often have high blood pressure, which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. High blood pressure can cause damage to the heart and other organs.

If you or someone you love has any of these warning signs, it is important to seek medical attention. Treatment for sleep apnea can improve symptoms and reduce the risk of serious health problems. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or quitting smoking, and medical treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines or oral appliances.

Sleep apnea is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. If you suspect that you or someone you love may have sleep apnea, it is important to seek medical attention. With proper treatment, sleep apnea can be managed effectively, allowing sufferers to get the restorative sleep they need and reducing the risk of serious health problems.",1
209,Police were called about a person with a rifle. It turned out to be a man in a Boba Fett costume,"Police officers in Nashville, Tennessee responded to a call about a person carrying a rifle in a public park on Saturday afternoon. The caller said that a man, dressed in full military gear, was walking around the park with a rifle in his hand. When the police officers arrived at the scene, they found the man in question, but it turned out that the situation wasn't as dangerous as they initially thought.

The man was not a threat to anyone, and the weapon he carried was not a rifle, but a replica blaster from the Star Wars franchise. The man was, in fact, dressed as the popular Star Wars character, Boba Fett.

The incident has shed light on the importance of proper identification when it comes to firearms and costumes. The man in the Boba Fett costume was not looking to harm anyone, but his costume could have been easily mistaken for someone who was looking to cause trouble.

The man, who has not been identified, was enjoying a day out with his children when he was approached by the police officers. He complied with their requests to put down his blaster and remove his helmet so they could identify him. According to reports, the officers were friendly and respectful throughout the encounter, and the man was allowed to continue his day without any further incident.

The Nashville Police Department has issued a statement about the incident, saying that they ""appreciate the vigilance of the citizen who reported the potential threat"" but also asking the public to ""exercise caution before calling police to report suspicious activity.""

Many Star Wars fans have expressed their sympathy for the man involved in the incident, saying that they can relate to his enthusiasm and passion for the popular franchise. The incident has also sparked debate about the use of replicas and costumes in public spaces, and the importance of proper identification when carrying any type of weapon.

This incident is not the first time that law enforcement has been called about someone carrying a fake weapon. In 2014, a Black cosplayer in Los Angeles was stopped by police carrying a fake gun as part of his costume. The incident went viral and sparked conversations about the racial profiling of Black men in cosplay.

In response, many cosplayers have advocated for better communication between cosplayers and law enforcement. Some have even suggested that cosplayers carry cards that explain the nature of their costumes and the fact that their weapons are not real.

This incident also highlights the importance of being mindful of the environment and context in which costumes are worn. While cosplaying can be a fun and engaging hobby, it is important to recognize that not everyone may understand or appreciate the context of a particular costume. In public spaces, costumes can be interpreted in a different light, and it is important to be respectful of others' concerns and sensitivities.

The incident in Nashville also underscores the importance of communication and cooperation between law enforcement and the public. While it is understandable that citizens may be concerned about potential threats, it is equally important to exercise caution before immediately calling the police. A little bit of investigation and communication can go a long way towards resolving such concerns without unnecessarily escalating the situation.

In conclusion, the incident in Nashville serves as a reminder of the importance of proper identification and communication when it comes to costumes and weapons in public spaces. While the man in the Boba Fett costume may have simply been enjoying a day out with his children, his costume and weapon could have easily been mistaken for a dangerous threat. As cosplaying continues to gain popularity, it is important for everyone to exercise caution, respect, and communication when dealing with these situations.",1
210,How to avoid the next crisis? Banks may have to hold more cash,"The global financial crisis of 2008 shook the world and exposed the flaws in the banking system. In its wake, regulators across the world began implementing strict rules and regulations to prevent such events from happening again. One of the biggest changes was requiring banks to hold a certain amount of cash to ensure they could handle crises. But, are those regulations enough?

As we've seen in the past, even with regulations, banks still find ways to engage in risky behavior. The banking system is a complex web of interconnected institutions, and a collapse of any one of them can trigger a domino effect that could impact the global economy. The question is, how can we prevent the next crisis?

The answer may lie in increasing the amount of cash banks are required to hold. While this may seem like a simple solution, implementing it is far from easy. But, before we delve into how this can be achieved, let's understand why holding more cash is necessary.

One of the reasons for the global financial crisis was the practice of banks lending too much money to homeowners who couldn't afford it. When homeowners defaulted, banks lost billions of dollars, causing the collapse of many banks and financial institutions. Banks that didn't collapse had to be bailed out by governments. This was because banks didn't have enough cash on hand to cover their losses.

Regulators responded by creating regulations that required banks to have a certain amount of capital on hand to cover their losses in times of crisis. The idea was that if they had enough cash, they would be able to weather the storm without having to rely on government bailouts.

However, the regulations were not stringent enough, leaving room for banks to engage in risky behavior. The issue was that the regulations didn't require banks to hold enough cash relative to the amount of loans they were making. This meant that banks were still making risky loans, and if those loans went bad, they would still not have enough cash on hand to cover their losses.

This is why increasing the amount of cash required to be held is necessary. If banks are required to hold more cash, they will be less likely to engage in risky lending practices. This is because they will have to consider whether they have enough cash on hand to cover potential losses before approving loans.

The issue with increasing the amount of cash required to be held is that it could impact the economy. Banks will have less money to lend, which could lead to a slowdown in economic growth. This is why regulators need to balance the need for banks to have enough cash with the need for them to continue lending.

There are different ways regulators can achieve this. One way is to require banks to hold a certain percentage of their assets in cash. This would ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to cover their losses in times of crisis. The downside is that it could limit the amount of lending banks can do, leading to a slowdown in economic growth.

Another option is to require banks to hold a certain amount of cash relative to the amount of loans they make. This would ensure that banks are not making risky loans because they would have to consider whether they have enough cash on hand to cover potential losses. This would also limit the amount of lending banks can do, but it would be more targeted and would not impact the overall economy as much.

Regulators could also require banks to create a rainy-day fund. This fund would be used to cover losses in times of crisis. Banks would have to contribute to the fund when times are good, and they would be able to draw from it when times are bad. This would ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to cover their losses, without limiting their ability to lend.

Another option is to require banks to hold more liquid assets. Liquid assets are assets that can be easily converted into cash, such as government securities. This would ensure that banks have enough cash on hand to cover their losses in times of crisis. However, it would limit the amount of money banks can make, as liquid assets typically have low returns.

Implementing any of these changes would be difficult. Banks would likely argue that they need to be able to lend to support the economy. However, regulators need to consider the long-term impact of their actions. If banks continue to engage in risky behavior and economies collapse, the impact would be far worse than the short-term impact of limiting lending.

In conclusion, the global financial crisis exposed flaws in the banking system that resulted in the collapse of many banks and financial institutions. Regulators responded by creating regulations that required banks to have a certain amount of cash on hand to cover their losses in times of crisis. However, those regulations were not stringent enough, leaving room for banks to engage in risky behavior.

Increasing the amount of cash banks are required to hold could prevent the next crisis by ensuring that banks are not making risky loans. However, regulators need to balance the need for banks to have enough cash with the need for them to continue lending to support the economy. Implementing this change would be difficult, but it would be worth it if it prevented financial crises in the future.",1
211,"When children are told they were born via assisted reproduction can affect outcomes, study finds","Assisted reproduction has become increasingly popular in recent years, with advancements in technology allowing couples struggling with infertility to conceive children they may not have been able to naturally. While this has been great news for many families, a new study has found that when children are told they were born via assisted reproduction can affect outcomes.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, surveyed 105 families with children born via assisted reproduction methods. The families were asked about their attitudes regarding disclosure of the child's conception and the child's outcomes in terms of psychological and behavioral health.

The researchers found that families who disclosed the child's conception earlier had better outcomes. Children who were told early on had fewer psychological and behavioral problems than those who found out later in life. Additionally, families who were open and honest about the child's conception had stronger family relationships and communication.

The study's lead author, Dr. Sarah Blake, explained that ""disclosure of the child's conception is a delicate matter for many families. However, our findings suggest that open and honest communication about a child's conception can lead to better outcomes for the child and the family as a whole.""

Blake also noted that families who waited until later in life to disclose the child's conception tended to have more emotional distress and difficulties with communication. ""The longer the child goes without knowing about their conception, the more confused and distrustful they may become,"" she said.

Assisted reproduction methods include in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and surrogacy. These methods have become increasingly popular, with around 1.7% of all live births in the United States being the result of assisted reproduction.

But the methods are not without their controversies. Some people argue that these methods go against natural reproductive processes and can lead to ethical dilemmas.

For families who have used assisted reproduction, deciding when and how to disclose the child's conception can be difficult. The study found that families who had a plan in place for disclosure and had discussed it beforehand had better outcomes.

Dr. Blake recommended that families should start talking about the child's conception early on, even before the child is born. ""We recommend that families start discussing disclosure during the pregnancy, so that they have a plan in place and can make a decision that is comfortable for them,"" she said.

The study's findings have significant implications for how families approach assisted reproduction and the importance of open and honest communication. ""Our study highlights the importance of communication and being open about the child's conception. It is important for families to address this early on, so that they can prevent potential negative outcomes down the line,"" said Blake.

While this study is one of the first to examine the impact of disclosure on children born via assisted reproduction, it is not the first study to highlight the importance of communication and transparency in families.

Previous studies have found that communication is essential in building strong family relationships, and that open communication can lead to better outcomes for children. The importance of communication is particularly important for children with mental health issues, as it can help them feel more secure and understood.

Assisted reproduction methods can also have a significant impact on the financial wellbeing of families. These methods are often expensive, and families may need to take out loans or use their retirement savings to afford them.

Despite the cost, families who have used assisted reproduction methods report high levels of satisfaction and happiness with their decision. Many parents feel that the joy of having a child far outweighs any financial burden or ethical dilemmas.

As assisted reproduction methods become more popular, it is essential that families understand the importance of communication and openness regarding their child's conception. This study highlights the benefits of early disclosure and may help families make an informed decision about when and how to disclose the child's conception to them.

In conclusion, the study found that when children are told they were born via assisted reproduction can affect outcomes. Open and honest communication about the child's conception can lead to better outcomes for the child and the family as a whole. Families should start discussing disclosure early on to prevent potential negative outcomes down the line. As assisted reproduction methods become more popular, it is important to understand the importance of communication and openness.",1
212,One pandemic policy is expiring and it means millions could lose health coverage,"The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed life as we know it. Yet, even as vaccinations increase and cases decline, the economic fallout from the pandemic continues to linger. One pandemic policy change, in particular, threatens to leave millions of Americans without health coverage.

The unemployment rate skyrocketed in 2020 as businesses closed and the economy slowed. In response, the government passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which granted expanded unemployment benefits to millions of Americans. As part of these benefits, the federal government provided $600 in additional unemployment aid per week to those who could no longer work due to the pandemic. 

However, this benefit is set to expire on September 6th, 2021. With the Delta variant sweeping the nation and threatening to bring about more business closures, the timing could not be worse. Millions of Americans depend on this unemployment aid to put food on the table and pay their bills, and the loss of this benefit could very well push them over the edge.

In addition to the economic uncertainty, the expiration of these benefits also means that millions could lose their health coverage. Many Americans receive their health insurance through their employers, so when they lose their jobs, they also lose their health coverage. The CARES Act provided a temporary solution to this problem by expanding Medicaid and allowing those who lost their jobs to enroll in healthcare exchanges. 

Without this safety net, millions of Americans could find themselves without healthcare coverage in the middle of a pandemic. This is particularly concerning given that Covid-19 has disproportionately impacted low-income communities and communities of color. If these communities lose access to healthcare at this critical moment, the consequences could be dire.

It is essential that Congress acts quickly to address this pandemic policy change. At a minimum, they should extend the $600 weekly unemployment benefit to provide struggling families with some sense of stability. Furthermore, they must ensure that those who lose their jobs can still access healthcare coverage. The pandemic is not over, and we cannot afford to put millions of Americans at risk by allowing them to lose their health coverage when they need it most.",1
213,This investor can spot market bubbles. Now he's warning of an 'ominous' bust,"As the stock market continues to soar to all-time highs, one veteran investor is warning of an ""ominous"" bust on the horizon.

Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of asset management firm GMO, has a track record of spotting market bubbles before they burst. He famously predicted the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and the housing market crash in 2008.

In an interview with CNN Business, Grantham said the current market is showing several signs of a bubble, including the rapid rise in stock prices, the surge in initial public offerings (IPOs) and special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), and the increase in stock market speculation by amateur investors.

""You're seeing the excesses that led us to all eight of the great bubbles I've studied before,"" he said. ""This is the real McCoy; this is crazy stuff.""

Grantham's warning comes as the S&P 500 has surged more than 70% since its pandemic-induced low in March 2020. The market has been boosted by unprecedented government stimulus and low interest rates, but Grantham said these factors are creating a dangerous environment for investors.

""Stimulus and low rates are wonderful for the first year and a half, and then they become a terrible burden,"" he said. ""And we're at that point now where they're becoming a burden.""

Grantham said the market's current valuation levels are ""deeply worrying,"" with the S&P 500 trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 30, compared to its historical average of around 15.

""We're talking about the U.S. stock market being in the top 1% of expensive markets,"" he said. ""That's a very ominous sign.""

Grantham also criticized the recent frenzy of IPOs and SPACs, which he said are being driven by ""unbridled speculation"" rather than the companies' underlying fundamentals.

""These speculative pockets are absolutely classic for bubbles,"" he said. ""They come up overnight, they capture people's imaginations, they capture the media, and they just run like mad. And at some point, of course, they puncture.""

Grantham said the surge in amateur investor participation, fueled by commission-free trading apps like Robinhood, is another sign of a frothy market. He said the recent GameStop saga, where retail investors drove up the stock price of the struggling video game retailer, was a ""warning signal"" for the broader market.

""The amateurs are in there with sufficient force, and they're doing stupid things, like buying GameStop at $400,"" he said. ""That is dangerous stuff.""

Grantham's warnings are not new. He has been cautioning about an impending bubble for years, and his firm's most recent quarterly letter to clients highlighted the ""potential damage"" that could be caused by investors chasing momentum and speculative stocks.

But Grantham said the pandemic has accelerated many of the market's excesses and made a bust more likely in the near future.

""I think we're in the last throes of the bubble, and it's starting to go crazy,"" he said. ""It's going to crash, and it's going to hurt.""

Grantham's predictions have drawn criticism from some quarters. Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, for example, recently called Grantham's warnings ""nonsense"" and said he was ""too negative"" about the market.

But Grantham said he has been through enough market cycles to know when things are getting out of hand.

""I've been around too long, and I've seen too many bubbles,"" he said. ""I know what they look like, and I know what the psychology is, and I'm seeing it again.""

Grantham's warning is not just directed at individual investors. He said institutional investors, like pension funds and endowments, are also at risk of being hurt by the impending bust.

""We have a fiduciary duty to our clients to not lose money,"" he said. ""And we're taking that very seriously, and we're trying to prepare for the inevitable crash.""

Grantham's advice to investors is to be cautious and focus on companies with solid fundamentals and reasonable valuations.

""Finding good companies is hard work,"" he said. ""It's not something you can do in five minutes on a trading app. You have to do your homework, you have to know the company, and you have to be willing to hold it for a while.""

Grantham's warning may be unsettling for investors who have enjoyed the stock market's recent gains. But as he has proven in the past, it's always worth listening to someone who has a history of spotting bubbles before they burst.",1
214,Hilary Swank gives birth to twins,"Hilary Swank Gives Birth to Twins: Hollywood Actress Welcomes New Additions to Her Family

It’s celebration time for Hollywood actress Hilary Swank as she gave birth to twins on Tuesday, May 4th. Swank, who is famously private about her personal life, announced her pregnancy in December 2020 with a heartwarming post shared on social media. The Oscar-winning actress and her husband, entrepreneur Philip Schneider, welcomed two healthy babies a few days ago, and the couple couldn’t be happier.

The announcement of Swank’s pregnancy had come as a surprise to her fans, especially as she had been keeping a low profile in the recent years. However, the actress couldn’t have been more thrilled to share the news with her followers on Instagram, writing, “coming soon…. #twins.”

Since then, Swank has kept a low profile throughout her pregnancy, refraining from sharing too many details about the upcoming arrival of her babies. However, in an interview with People Magazine last year, Swank shared how excited she was to start a family with Schneider, whom she married in 2018.

“Since marrying Philip, I’ve yearned for a partnership where there are shared moments, a commonality of purpose, and a mutual understanding of each other’s dreams and goals in life,” Swank said in the interview. “When you are in a place where you have found that, it seems like a natural progression to want to start a family.”

And it seems as if Swank’s dreams have come true. Now, the 46-year-old actress and Schneider have become proud parents to two healthy babies.

Swank’s friends and colleagues from the film industry were quick to send their congratulatory messages to the actress on social media. Reese Witherspoon shared a photo of Swank holding a baby bump, writing, “Oh my goodness! How incredibly exciting!!! Congratulations on creating two humans! Well done you!”

Actress and Swank’s former co-star in the movie ‘Boys Don’t Cry,’ Chloe Sevigny wrote, “Congratulations to my dear friend and rock of a mama,” while actress Mandy Moore commented, “Congrats to the new mama and papa! Love you, Hil.”

Swank and Schneider, who is a social venture entrepreneur, tied the knot in a private ceremony on August 18, 2018, in the California Redwoods. The couple had met while attending a mutual friend’s wedding in 2016 and embarked on a romantic relationship soon after.

Swank had previously been married to actor Chad Lowe from 1997 to 2007, and the couple had no children together. Following her divorce from Lowe, Swank had been in a relationship with Ruben Torres, a former tennis professional, for over a year before they called off their engagement in 2018.

Known for her performances in movies like ‘Million Dollar Baby’ and ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ – for which she won two Academy Awards for Best Actress – Swank has been on a self-imposed hiatus from movies for the past few years. In an interview with InStyle Magazine last year, Swank had shared how she had been spending her time during her break.

“I’ve been focusing on fulfilling my other passions: producing, philanthropy, and my work as a global ambassador for the National Women’s History Museum,” Swank had said in the interview. “I’ve also started exploring new hobbies and interests, like beekeeping, which has been incredibly rewarding.”

Swank is also an animal rights activist and has been vocal about her concerns for the well-being of animals. In her interview with InStyle, Swank had revealed how she has been raising awareness about the impact of COVID-19 on animals and how it has affected animal shelters.

Now, as Swank takes on the role of a mother to twin babies, fans are excited to see where her journey takes her from here. While it is unclear when Swank will be returning to the movies, fans of the actress are hoping she will be seen on the big screen soon.

For now, Hilary Swank is enjoying motherhood and basking in the love and affection of her family and close friends. The actress has yet to reveal the names of her twins or share any photos of the newborns on social media.

But as the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, Swank’s new journey as a mother to her twin babies is a reminder of hope and possibility – a reminder that even in the darkest of times, new beginnings and joyful moments can continue to make life worth living.",1
215,Hear 911 audio from Louisville bank shooter's mother,"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) - The mother of a man accused of shooting two people at a bank in Louisville last week has released a 911 call she made to authorities in the moments following the shooting.

The recording, obtained exclusively by CNN, sheds new light on the events leading up to the violent attack on Wednesday. In the call, the mother can be heard frantically relaying information to the dispatcher, saying that her son, identified by authorities as John Doe, was ""acting strange"" and had ""been talking about revenge.""

""He just ran out of the house with a gun,"" the mother can be heard saying on the call. ""I don't know what he's going to do.""

Moments later, the call takes a dramatic turn as the mother reports that her son has arrived at the bank and is shooting people.

""He's inside the bank, shooting people,"" she says. ""He's still shooting.""

The call ends abruptly as the mother says she hears police sirens approaching.

The shooting at the Louisville bank left two people dead and one injured. Doe was apprehended by police after a brief standoff and is now facing multiple charges, including murder and attempted murder.

The release of the 911 recording is the latest development in what has become one of the most high-profile shooting incidents in Louisville's recent history. The victims have been identified as bank employees Jane Doe and John Smith, both of whom were well-respected members of the community.

216,"Coffee drinkers get more steps but also less sleep, study finds","Coffee is the world's most popular beverage, with over 2 billion cups consumed each day. It's no secret that coffee is a staple for many people, providing the perfect pick-me-up to start their day. However, what happens when coffee consumption is combined with an active lifestyle? A recent study has found that coffee drinkers tend to take more steps throughout the day but also suffer from poorer sleep quality.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, analyzed data from over 400 adults who regularly consume coffee. Participants were asked to wear an activity tracker for one week and record their daily coffee intake. Additionally, they were asked to complete a sleep diary each morning to track the quality and duration of their sleep.

Upon analyzing the data, the researchers found that individuals who drank more coffee tended to take more steps and have a higher level of physical activity. They also tended to have a higher caloric intake, which is not surprising considering that caffeine is known to increase metabolism.

However, the study also revealed that individuals who drank more coffee tended to have poorer sleep quality. Specifically, they had a shorter duration of sleep and spent less time in deep sleep, which is the most restorative stage of sleep. This was particularly evident among those who drank coffee later in the day or in the evening.

The study's lead author, Aric Prather, explains that caffeine's effects on the body can last up to six hours, making it difficult for individuals to fall asleep or stay asleep. ""Caffeine is a stimulant that can increase alertness and disrupt sleep quality,"" he says. ""This can lead to a vicious cycle where individuals drink more coffee to combat fatigue, which in turn worsens their sleep quality.""

While the study's findings may seem discouraging for coffee lovers, Prather emphasizes that the key is moderation. ""We're not saying that individuals should stop drinking coffee altogether,"" he says. ""Rather, it's important to be mindful of how much caffeine you're consuming and when you're consuming it."" 

Prather suggests that individuals limit their coffee intake to no more than three cups per day and avoid drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening to ensure better sleep quality. He also encourages individuals to establish a consistent sleep routine, including a regular bedtime and waking time, which can help regulate their sleep patterns.

Despite the potential drawbacks of coffee consumption on sleep quality, the study highlights the positive effects of physical activity on overall health. ""Coffee consumption alone may not be enough to improve health. However, combining coffee consumption with regular physical activity, such as walking, can provide numerous benefits,"" explains Prather. ""Physical activity not only promotes better sleep quality but also has numerous other health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.""

In conclusion, the study found that coffee drinkers tend to take more steps throughout the day but also suffer from poorer sleep quality. While coffee consumption can provide numerous benefits, individuals should be mindful of how much caffeine they're consuming and when they're consuming it to ensure better sleep quality. Additionally, combining coffee consumption with regular physical activity can provide numerous health benefits and improve overall well-being.",1
217,ChatGPT can write sermons. Religious leaders don't know how to feel about it,"Inside the world of religion, many religious leaders have become baffled and confused following the development of ChatGPT which can write sermons. The unique ability of the AI-powered platform to generate religious speeches has become a topic of discussion among various religious communities.

For centuries, religious leaders have been saddled with the enormous task of articulating and conveying the tenets of their faith to their flock. The task has often been daunting and has required an enormous amount of energy, time, and dedication.

However, technology has revolutionized the way things are done, and various industries have been positively impacted. The religious community isn't left out, as various tech advancements have improved the way religious activities are carried out. From live streaming to online prayer meetings, there are lots of ways that religion is adapting to technology.

However, the advent of an AI-powered program, ChatGPT, that can write sermons has left many religious leaders sweating. While acknowledging the usefulness of the technology, many believing leaders feel that it will threaten their source of livelihood and might result in a loss of spiritual connection with their congregation.

As a modern tool, ChatGPT is designed to generate a persuasive persuasive oration on any subject matter. In essence, the technology can effectively create religious speeches that can inspire and motivate people to action. The tool uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret and respond to human queries.

ChatGPT makes use of a large dataset of texts such as speeches, religious texts, and other forms of literature to create unique religious discourses. Within seconds, the program can generate relevant sermons on a range of topics, from religious ethics and morality to social justice and world peace.

At first glance, the technology seems to be a fantastic invention that will help religious leaders generate well-articulated speeches with ease. But as one dives deeper into its usage, it becomes evident that it could be a double-edged sword.

Some religious leaders are worried that ChatGPT will replace the human element necessary in religious communication. There is a suggestion that the tool could create a distance between people and their beliefs if they come to rely solely on it. It suggests that the beautiful, intricate, and intimate relationship created during religious events will disappear since the religious leader will be replaced by a machine.

Another worry some religious leaders have is the uncertainty and ethical implications surrounding the use of such technologies. They worry that the ChatGPT might output content that does not align with the teachings of the faith, which may lead to the misinterpretation of religious principles and doctrines.

On the other hand, there are arguments that religiosity requires innovation and adaptation. Some religious leaders believe that ChatGPT could be a game-changer in enabling religious leaders to articulate their faith with more precision and clarity.

Proponents of the technology suggest that its use could help emerging ministries that need to keep up with the expectations of their congregations while easing the burden that comes with preparing sermons. It also encourages consistency in messaging, ensuring that the message delivered every time from the AI platform is in line with the religious creed.

One of the most significant arguments in favor of ChatGPT is its ability to democratize religious discourses. It can help those who might not have access or the financial means to attend religious events to still partake in the spiritual messaging. It's undeniable that the AI technology, when adequately managed, could break down cultural barriers and create a broader and more inclusive religious community.

Given these divergent views, it is safe to say that a compromise may be the best way forward. ChatGPT can likely support religious leaders and help them develop their messages to reach a wider audience. However, it is essential to note that no matter how sophisticated the tool may be, it can never replace the unique personal connection that a religious leader fosters with their followers.

Religious leaders can see the ChatGPT as an addition instead of a replacement of religious communication. It is a tool that can assist them in the preparation of sermons while also enabling them to focus on other critical aspects of religious activities such as counseling, mentoring and helping the less privileged in society.

In conclusion, the advent of ChatGPT in religious circles is a sign that traditional religious activities are evolving. Nonetheless, religious leaders must remember that while the tool is essential, it should serve as an addition to religious practices and not a replacement. There must be a careful balance between embracing new tech advancements and maintaining the core values that are fundamental to their faith. This way, religious leaders can continue to inspire and provide meaning to their followers without feeling threatened by the evolution of technology.",1
218,Affirmative Action Fast Facts,"Affirmative Action Fast Facts

Affirmative action is an umbrella term that refers to policies aimed at promoting a diverse workforce and addressing past discrimination against underrepresented groups, such as women, people of color, and people with disabilities. It is a contentious issue that has sparked debates and legal challenges in the United States. This article provides an overview of the key facts and controversies surrounding affirmative action.

What is Affirmative Action?

Affirmative action is a set of policies and practices designed to counteract past discrimination and to promote diversity in employment, education, and other areas where underrepresented groups have been historically disadvantaged. It typically involves setting goals and quotas for the representation of women and minorities, and using flexible or preferential treatment in hiring, promotion, and admissions processes to achieve those goals.

The first affirmative action programs were implemented in the 1960s, in response to the civil rights movement and the increasing awareness of discrimination against minorities and women. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment, but it did not provide specific guidance on how to address disparities that had already been established. As a result, federal agencies and contractors began using affirmative action plans to promote diversity and mitigate discrimination.

Affirmative action programs have evolved over time, depending on political and legal developments. In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in Bakke v. Regents of the University of California that racial quotas were unconstitutional, but upheld the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions. Since then, affirmative action has faced a number of legal challenges at the state and federal level, and its fate has hinged on the interpretation of the Constitution and the scope of anti-discrimination laws.

Affirmative Action in Education

One of the most controversial arenas of affirmative action is higher education admissions, where universities and colleges use various methods to promote diversity among their student populations. Affirmative action in admissions may take the form of racial preferences, socioeconomic considerations, or other factors that indicate a candidate's potential to contribute to a diverse learning environment.

Proponents of affirmative action argue that it is necessary to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to succeed, and that diversity in higher education enhances the educational experience for all students. They also point to statistics that show that minorities and women are still underrepresented in many fields, and that affirmative action is a way to level the playing field.

Opponents of affirmative action argue that it is inherently discriminatory and violates the principle of meritocracy, whereby admission to a college or university should be based on academic and personal qualifications alone. They also contend that affirmative action leads to reverse discrimination, whereby well-qualified candidates are turned away in favor of less-qualified minorities or women. Some also argue that affirmative action stigmatizes minority students by suggesting that they need special treatment to succeed.

The Supreme Court has issued several major decisions on affirmative action in education in recent years. In 2003, the Court upheld the use of race as a factor in admissions decisions in the case of Grutter v. Bollinger, but struck down a point system that awarded extra points to minority applicants. The Court emphasized that affirmative action must be narrowly tailored and serve a compelling interest in promoting diversity.

In 2013, the Court issued another landmark decision in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, which upheld the use of race in college admissions, but required universities to demonstrate that no other tools would produce the same level of diversity. The decision left the door open for future legal challenges to affirmative action, and has led to more scrutiny of admissions policies at colleges and universities.

Affirmative Action in Employment

Affirmative action in employment applies to both public and private sector employers, and is aimed at increasing diversity and eliminating discrimination in hiring, promotion, and retention practices. Federal contractors and subcontractors are required by law to develop affirmative action plans, which detail the steps they will take to ensure that their workforce reflects the diversity of the community.

Affirmative action in employment may involve setting goals and timetables for hiring and promoting underrepresented groups, developing outreach and recruitment programs, and implementing training and mentoring programs. In some cases, employers may also use preferential treatment, such as giving priority to qualified minority candidates or creating mentorship opportunities specifically for women or people of color.

Opponents of affirmative action in employment argue that it is unfair to hire or promote someone based on their race or gender, rather than their qualifications and experience. They also contend that affirmative action leads to reverse discrimination, whereby well-qualified candidates are passed over in favor of less-qualified minority or female candidates. Some argue that affirmative action creates a ""quota mentality"" that undermines individual effort and achievement.

Proponents of affirmative action in employment argue that it is necessary to break down barriers to equal employment opportunity, and that it benefits both employers and employees by promoting a more diverse and innovative workforce. They also point out that affirmative action is not about giving unqualified individuals preferential treatment, but about considering a candidate's potential and qualifications holistically.

The legality of affirmative action in employment has also been challenged in several court cases. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in Grutter v. Bollinger that narrowly-tailored affirmative action plans in education and employment can promote diversity and are constitutional. The Court emphasized that affirmative action must be flexible and nonmechanical, and that individuals must be evaluated as individuals.

However, the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in Ricci v. DeStefano cast some doubt on the future of affirmative action in employment. In that case, the Court ruled that a city had discriminated against white and Hispanic firefighters by rejecting the results of an exam in which no black firefighters had scored high enough to be promoted. The decision suggested that employers must have a strong basis in evidence to justify taking race into consideration in employment decisions.

Affirmative Action in Politics

Affirmative action in politics refers to policies and practices aimed at increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in political office. This includes efforts to increase the number of women, racial minorities, and LGBT individuals in elected positions at all levels of government.

The use of affirmative action in politics is controversial, with opponents arguing that it undermines the principle of meritocracy and promotes identity politics over qualifications. Proponents argue that it is necessary to ensure that all voices are heard in the political process, and that diversity in elected bodies leads to better policy outcomes.

Affirmative action in politics takes various forms, including electoral quotas or mandates, targeted recruitment and training programs, and redistricting reforms. In some countries, such as South Africa and India, affirmative action has been enshrined in law as a means of redressing historic discrimination.

The legality of affirmative action in politics has also been challenged in several court cases. In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Johnson that race-based redistricting can be unconstitutional if it is done solely for the purpose of creating a majority-minority district. The Court emphasized that districts must be shaped by neutral principles, such as compactness and contiguity, and not primarily by race.

More recently, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that required certain states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before making changes to their election laws. The decision has made it easier for states to enact voter ID laws and other measures that critics argue are designed to suppress the votes of minorities and other marginalized groups.

Conclusion

Affirmative action is a complex and contentious issue that raises fundamental questions about the role of government in promoting diversity and justice. Its fate has been determined by a series of legal decisions and political debates, with different interpretations of the Constitution and competing visions of social equality.

While the future of affirmative action is uncertain, it is clear that the issue will continue to spark discussions and activism in the years to come. Whether it is in education, employment, or politics, affirmative action will remain a powerful tool for advancing social justice and promoting diversity in America and beyond.",1
219,Dalai Lama apologizes after video asking child to 'suck' his tongue sparks outcry,"On Saturday, the Dalai Lama issued a public apology for a controversial video that has been circulating online in which he appears to ask a young child to ""suck"" his tongue.

The video, which was recorded at a public event in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, shows the 83-year-old spiritual leader sitting on stage with a group of people around him, including an interpreter and a young child.

In the video, the Dalai Lama can be seen making a series of gestures and facial expressions, which the interpreter explains to the child. At one point, the Dalai Lama appears to ask the child to ""put your tongue out"" and then motions for the child to lean in closer to him. He then asks the child to ""suck"" his tongue.

The video quickly went viral on social media, with many expressing shock and outrage over what they felt was an inappropriate request from the Dalai Lama. Many people felt that the video was particularly troubling given the spiritual leader's reputation as a champion of human rights and an advocate for the protection of children.

In response to the backlash, the Dalai Lama issued a statement apologizing for his actions. ""I apologize if I have caused any offense or hurt to anyone with my actions,"" the statement read. ""It was never my intention to cause any harm, and I deeply regret any offense that has been caused.""

The Dalai Lama went on to explain that he had simply been trying to engage with the child in a playful way, and that his words had been taken out of context. ""I often engage in playful banter with children, and I sometimes make silly gestures or say silly things in order to make them laugh,"" he said. ""I understand that my words may have been misunderstood or misinterpreted, and for that, I am truly sorry.""

The apology has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some have praised the Dalai Lama for taking responsibility for his actions and expressing remorse, while others feel that the apology falls short of addressing the seriousness of the issue.

Many have pointed out that the Dalai Lama's words and actions are particularly troubling given the prevalence of sexual abuse and misconduct within spiritual communities. The incident has sparked a larger conversation about the need for greater transparency, accountability, and education around issues of consent and boundaries in spiritual contexts.

Some have also questioned whether the Dalai Lama's actions should disqualify him from his role as a spiritual leader and advocate for human rights. While some feel that the incident highlights a concerning pattern of behavior that cannot be overlooked, others feel that the Dalai Lama's years of work and advocacy should not be discounted over a single incident.

Throughout his career, the Dalai Lama has been a vocal advocate for human rights, particularly for the Tibetan people. He has been awarded numerous honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.

Despite the controversy, the Dalai Lama remains a revered figure for many around the world. His teachings on compassion, forgiveness, and mindfulness have inspired millions, and his commitment to nonviolence and social justice has been a guiding force in global efforts for peace and equality.

However, many are now urging the Dalai Lama to use this moment as an opportunity to address the larger issues of consent, boundaries, and power dynamics within spiritual communities. They are calling for more education and training around these issues, as well as greater transparency and accountability for spiritual leaders who abuse their positions of trust.

The Dalai Lama's apology is a reminder that even the most revered and respected figures can make mistakes, and that it is important to hold all individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their status or reputation.

As we continue to grapple with issues of abuse, misconduct, and power in a variety of contexts, we must prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals, and work to create a culture of openness, honesty, and accountability. Only then can we begin to heal the wounds caused by acts of harm and abuse, and move forward towards a more just and equitable society.",1
220,U.S. doctor: We are already in an abortion crisis,"According to U.S. doctor Dr. Leana Wen, there is already an abortion crisis in the country. In an interview with CNN, Dr. Wen stated that the ongoing threats to reproductive health care accessibility are putting women’s lives at risk.

Dr. Wen, a former president of Planned Parenthood and current visiting professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, pointed out that more than 20 states have passed laws restricting access to abortion in recent years, with some doing so in direct contradiction to Supreme Court precedent. She also highlighted the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to numerous states labeling abortion as a non-essential procedure and thus temporarily closing clinics.

This, Dr. Wen believes, is already having a major impact on women’s health. She notes that women are being forced to travel hundreds of miles to obtain abortion services, while others may resort to dangerous and illegal means to terminate their pregnancies. In some cases, Dr. Wen says that women who are carrying nonviable pregnancies and whose lives are at risk are being forced to undergo traumatic procedures due to legal restrictions on abortion.

Dr. Wen argues that the solution to the abortion crisis is clear: the United States needs to recognize reproductive health care as essential health care, just as it does with other essential medical services. This would mean that access to abortion care would no longer be subject to political whims or the influence of anti-abortion organizations. Ultimately, Dr. Wen believes that women’s lives depend on it.",1
221,First Atlantic hurricane season forecast issued on the same day as El Niño watch,"On May 23rd, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its first forecast for the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. The agency predicted a near-normal season with a 40% chance of an above-normal season and a 30% chance of a below-normal season. The announcement came on the same day that the agency issued a watch for the El Niño weather phenomenon, which could impact the number and intensity of storms this season.

The forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1st to November 30th, calls for a range of 9 to 15 named storms (storms with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher), of which 4 to 8 could become hurricanes (storms with winds of 74 miles per hour or higher), including 2 to 4 major hurricanes (storms with winds of 111 miles per hour or higher).

Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said that conditions in the Atlantic Ocean are more favorable for a near-normal season this year, with warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures and weaker-than-average wind shear. However, he cautioned that an above-normal season is still possible due to factors such as the potential development of El Niño.

El Niño is a weather pattern characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. It can affect weather patterns worldwide, including the number and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes. During El Niño years, wind shear in the Atlantic tends to be stronger, which can inhibit the development of hurricanes.

NOAA has issued a watch for the potential development of El Niño this year, which means there is a 50% chance that the pattern will form by late summer or early fall. If El Niño develops, it could impact the number and intensity of hurricanes this season.

“This is a year when we’re more uncertain than usual,” Bell said. “If El Niño does develop, that would tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity.”

In addition to El Niño, there are other factors that could affect the Atlantic hurricane season this year. For example, an above-average number of dust outbreaks from the Sahara Desert could reduce the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which would make it harder for storms to form and strengthen. Conversely, warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic could fuel the development of storms.

Despite the uncertainty, NOAA emphasizes the importance of preparedness.

“Regardless of the outlook, it’s important for everyone in hurricane-prone areas to prepare now,” said Neil Jacobs, the acting NOAA administrator. “We urge everyone to learn more about hurricane hazards and prepare themselves, their families, and their communities.”

Preparation can include having an emergency plan, stocking up on supplies, and staying informed about weather conditions.

The 2018 Atlantic hurricane season was above-average, with 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. This included Hurricane Florence, which made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 1 hurricane and caused widespread flooding, and Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Florida as a Category 5 hurricane and was responsible for at least 70 deaths across several states.

Hurricane season forecasts are important for emergency managers, government agencies, and the general public. They provide an early indication of the potential risks and can help guide preparations and evacuations if necessary.

The NOAA forecast is just one of several that will be issued ahead of the hurricane season. Other organizations, such as Colorado State University and Tropical Storm Risk, will also release their forecasts in the coming weeks.

It’s worth noting that while hurricane season officially runs from June 1st to November 30th, storms can occur outside of this time frame. In fact, the first named storm of the season, Subtropical Storm Andrea, formed on May 20th and dissipated two days later.

As we head into the summer months, it’s important to stay informed about weather conditions and prepare for the potential impact of a hurricane. Whether or not El Niño develops and affects the number and intensity of storms this season, it only takes one storm to cause significant damage and loss of life. By taking precautions and being prepared, we can minimize the impacts of these powerful storms.",1
222,"Investors are watching guidance this earnings season, but might not like what they see","As companies begin to report their quarterly earnings this season, investors are eagerly awaiting their guidance for the future. However, the outlook might not be as optimistic as investors hope.

The pandemic has caused widespread economic uncertainty, leading many companies to withdraw their guidance earlier in the year. Now, as some semblance of normalcy begins to return, investors are looking for indications that businesses are recovering.

Unfortunately, the picture is not as rosy as investors might expect. Many companies are facing ongoing challenges that signal a rocky road ahead.

Firstly, there is the ongoing impact of the pandemic. While vaccinations are rolling out across the world, many countries, particularly emerging markets, are still struggling to contain the virus. This ongoing uncertainty could lead to further lockdowns and restrictions, causing further damage to global economies.

Secondly, there is the issue of rising inflation. Prices of goods and services have been steadily increasing, particularly in the US. While the Federal Reserve has stated that inflation is likely to be temporary, the increasing costs could lead to higher prices for consumers, impacting companies' profitability.

These factors are likely to weigh on guidance this earnings season. In fact, some companies have already warned of an uncertain future.

Delta Airlines, for example, warned that revenue growth would slow in the second half of the year and that the ongoing pandemic could impact demand for air travel. Coca-Cola similarly warned that the rising cost of raw materials would impact their profitability.

Other companies have withdrawn their guidance entirely, indicating that the future is too uncertain to make predictions. For example, online marketplace Etsy withdrew its guidance for the second quarter and full year, citing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.

These warnings and withdrawals are likely to have an impact on investor sentiment. Wall Street has enjoyed a strong run over the past year, despite the ongoing impact of the pandemic. However, concerns about rising inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty could put a damper on investor confidence.

Rising inflation is a particular concern for investors. If companies are forced to raise prices to offset the cost of raw materials, consumers may be less likely to make purchases, leading to a decrease in revenue. This, in turn, could impact companies' profits, leading to a decrease in stock prices.

Furthermore, if the pandemic continues to spread in certain areas, it could lead to further lockdowns and restrictions, impacting businesses that rely on in-person interactions. This could lead to a decrease in revenue and profits, further depressing investor sentiment.

While the outlook may be mixed this earnings season, there are still opportunities for investors. Companies that have adapted well to the pandemic, such as online retailers, may continue to perform well. Additionally, companies that are well-positioned to weather rising inflation, such as those that provide essential goods and services, may also continue to perform well.

Investors should also keep an eye on companies' long-term strategies. While short-term guidance may be impacted by ongoing uncertainty, companies that have a clear vision for the future and a plan to execute it may be better positioned for long-term success.

As always, investors should practice diversification and invest in a range of assets to mitigate risk. While the outlook may be uncertain, there are still opportunities for investors who do their homework and stay aware of the ongoing economic environment.

In conclusion, this earnings season is likely to be marked by uncertainty and caution. While many companies are warning of a rocky road ahead, investors should stay focused on the long-term and consider companies that are well-positioned to weather economic headwinds.",1
223,Children and teens are more likely to die by guns than anything else,"According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), children and teenagers in the United States are more likely to die from gun-related injuries than from any other cause. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has identified gun violence as a major public health issue for children and teens.

Statistics from the CDC reveal that there were over 3,100 firearm deaths among children and teenagers aged 0-19 in the United States in 2019. This includes homicides, suicides, accidental shootings, and deaths due to undetermined intent. This number has been steadily increasing since 2013 and is now at its highest level since 1997.

Homicide by firearms is the leading cause of death among African-American children and teenagers, whereas suicide is the leading cause of firearm deaths among White youth. Furthermore, boys are much more likely to die from gun violence than girls. Data also shows that firearms are a leading cause of death for children aged 1-17 and the second-leading cause of death for teenagers aged 15-19.

Many of these deaths could have been prevented, according to the AAP. In a policy statement, the organization urges lawmakers to implement policies that could reduce the number of gun-related deaths among young people.

Among the AAP's recommendations are background checks for gun purchasers, a ban on assault-style weapons, and mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. The organization also advocates for educating parents on the importance of guns safety measures and storing firearms locked, unloaded, and in places inaccessible to children.

Guns in the home can also prove to be a dangerous combination with kids. Studies have shown that children who live in homes with guns are more likely to be injured or killed by them. In fact, firearms are responsible for a higher percentage of unintentional deaths among youth than any other cause, according to the AAP.

The AAP, along with other medical and public health organizations, argues that gun violence is a preventable public health issue that requires both policy changes and public education initiatives.

“Firearm deaths among children are a public health crisis,"" said Dr. Thomas McInerny, president of AAP. ""Our goal is to ensure children and teens have a safe environment in which to grow and learn. To make this a reality, we must better understand firearm injuries and deaths, fund research, and work together to develop and implement real, lasting solutions that will protect children and families.”

Opponents of stricter gun laws argue that such measures would infringe on Second Amendment rights and that guns are necessary for self-defense. However, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, the presence of a firearm in the home is associated with an increased risk of death by gunshot. The study found that for every time a gun was used in self-defense, there were 11 suicides and 7 homicides involving a firearm.

In addition to stricter gun laws, advocates also call for more funding for research into gun violence. In 1996, Congress passed a measure known as the Dickey Amendment, which prohibited the CDC from using federal funds to ""advocate or promote gun control."" This restriction has hindered research into gun violence prevention, according to medical professionals.

In 2018, Congress passed an additional measure that allocated $25 million in funding for research into gun violence prevention. However, advocates argue that this amount is still significantly lower than what is needed to address a major public health issue.

Gun violence and its impact on children and teenagers is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Advocates argue that a combination of policy changes and public education initiatives could help reduce the number of gun-related deaths among young people.

In the meantime, parents and guardians can take steps to ensure their children's safety around guns. The AAP recommends that parents ask about the presence of guns in other homes where their children play and to encourage other parents to store guns safely.

""Parents should be asking about the presence of firearms and how they are stored when their children go to play at the home of a friend or relative,"" said Dr. Benjamin S. Glick, member of the AAP Council on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention. ""The conversation should be respectful and non-judgmental, and the goal should be to ensure that guns are stored safely so children cannot access them.""

Ultimately, it will take a concerted effort from lawmakers, medical professionals, educators, and parents to address the pervasive issue of gun violence involving children and youth. By working together, we can take significant steps toward creating a safer environment in which our children can thrive.",1
224,Colorectal cancer is rising among younger adults and scientists are racing to uncover why,"Colorectal cancer is rising among younger adults and scientists are racing to uncover why

Over the past decade, cases of colorectal cancer have been alarmingly increasing in younger adults. In the past, the disease was considered as a problem exclusively affecting those over 50 years old. However, it is now happening with more frequency in people as young as their 20s and 30s. This demographic shift presents several challenges to health professionals and researchers, who have been trying to comprehend the causes behind this change and find new ways to screen and diagnose it. 

According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), colorectal cancer is commonly found in people aged 45 years old and above, while the incidence in individuals younger than that age was comparatively rare. Nonetheless, over the past few years, colorectal cancer cases have been surging among younger people. It is said that people who were born in 1990, for example, have twice the risk of developing colon cancer and four times the risk of developing rectal cancer as those born in 1950. 

The implications of this shift are immense. Colorectal cancer, if not detected early, can be lethal. The disease occurs when abnormal growths in the colon or rectum, known as polyps, become cancerous. In its early stages, colorectal cancer can present few symptoms. However, in advanced stages, the symptoms are harsher, including fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The disease's impact is not limited to the individual. It can also have an enormous impact on their families and loved ones, leading to emotional and financial stress that can be difficult to bear. 

The reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer in younger adults are not entirely understood. Studies suggest that there may be a combination of factors that can contribute to it. Some of the suspected culprits include the rise of obesity, unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity, among others. 

""We know that some risk factors for colorectal cancer are lifestyle choices, such as diet, physical activity, and smoking,"" says Dr. Nicole Williams, a gastroenterologist from the University of Chicago. ""We also know that there may be genetic and epigenetic factors predisposing people to colorectal cancer, but we still do not understand all the causes.""

There is a growing consensus among research experts that unhealthy diets and the decline in physical activity may be contributing to the increase in colorectal cancer cases. Over time, a diet high in fat, sugar and processed meats can cause inflammation in the colon, which can lead to the formation of polyps. Additionally, a sedentary lifestyle can slow down the digestive system, leading to constipation and other colon problems. 

The continued rise in obesity rates is another factor that may be linked to the rise in colorectal cancer cases. According to a recent study, obesity and an unhealthy diet may account for up to 70% of colorectal cancer cases in young adults. 

""We are seeing the effect of obesity on colorectal cancer risk,"" said Dr. Williams. ""The prevalence of obesity is rising, and as it does, we see an increase in many chronic diseases, including colorectal cancer.""

Apart from lifestyle factors, genetics also play a role in colorectal cancer. For example, individuals with Lynch syndrome carry a high risk of developing colon cancer. This condition is caused by a genetic mutation that prevents the body from repairing DNA changes that occur during cell division adequately. In other cases, genetic predispositions may be caused by mutations in other genes. 

Despite the increased risk of colorectal cancer in younger adults, cancer screening guidelines have remained relatively constant. The ACS still recommends that people should start getting screened for colon cancer starting at 45 years of age. Those with a higher risk, however, should start at an earlier age. For example, those with family members who have had colon cancer should start screening about ten years earlier than the age of the relative at diagnosis. 

Colonoscopies, which have been the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening, may need to change. Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure that many people avoid because of discomfort and fear of the symptoms that follow. Prior data has shown that people tend to delay the procedure or not doing it at all due to the perceived discomfort.

To address this, newer, less-invasive tests that can screen for colorectal cancer are being developed. For example, there are blood-based tests that can detect colon cancer. These tests identify DNA shed by cancer cells that have been transferred to the bloodstream. ""We are hopeful that these newer screening tests will increase colorectal cancer screening and identify people who should have additional testing earlier,"" said Dr. Williams.

Additionally, there are robotic screening exams that can be more accurate and less painful than the traditional colonoscopy. The virtual colonoscopy uses a CT scan to detect polyps, obviating the need for going under sedation or inserting a camera into the rectum.

Moreover, some drugs are being tested to try and prevent colorectal cancer before it begins. For example, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that aspirin reduces the risk of colorectal cancer in people who have Lynch syndrome. 

In conclusion, scientists and health professionals are racing to deal with the growing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger people. Researchers are probing the causes behind the rise in cases in recent years, with some indication of the contribution of unhealthy diets, obesity, lack of exercise and genetic factors. Additionally, less invasive and less painful screening methods and prevention treatments are also emerging, providing hope that earlier detection and prevention may be achievable. Ultimately, the rise in colorectal cancer cases underscores the urgent need for people of all ages to proactively assess their risk, undergo screening, adopt healthy lifestyles, and follow medical guidelines for colorectal cancer prevention and care.",1
225,"Judge in Dominion case sanctions Fox for withholding evidence, plans to appoint special master to probe possible misconduct","In a major development in the ongoing legal battle between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News, a federal judge has sanctioned the news channel for withholding crucial evidence in the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion against Fox.

In a ruling on Thursday, May 6, US District Judge John Marshall issued the sanctions against Fox, stating that the channel failed to turn over documents and communications requested by Dominion in the case.

The judge also announced that he is planning to appoint a special master to investigate possible misconduct on the part of Fox, including the deletion of digital evidence.

The decision is a significant blow to Fox News, which has been accused of spreading election-related conspiracy theories and misinformation about Dominion Voting Systems.

Dominion filed a $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox and several of its hosts in February, alleging that the channel made false and defamatory statements about the company in an effort to discredit it.

The lawsuit is one of several filed by Dominion in response to the baseless claims made by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, who alleged that the company's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden.

Fox News, which aired numerous segments supporting the election fraud conspiracy theories, has denied any wrongdoing, arguing that its coverage was protected under the First Amendment.

However, Judge Marshall's ruling suggests that Fox's defense may not hold up in court.

According to the judge's order, Fox failed to produce documents and communications requested by Dominion during the discovery phase of the lawsuit, despite being ordered to by the court.

The missing materials included drafts of news scripts and commentary, internal communications about Dominion and its voting machines, and records of any investigations Fox conducted into Dominion.

The judge noted that the missing evidence was particularly significant because some of the key defamation allegations against Fox related to statements made by its hosts and guests about Dominion's voting machines.

""The missing evidence would be directly relevant to these claims and may well support or undercut them,"" Judge Marshall wrote.

He also expressed concern that Fox may have deleted digital evidence that could have been used in the case.

""The Court is also concerned that Fox may have deleted digital evidence that it was required to preserve,"" he wrote. ""Fox's failure to retain such evidence may be grounds for spoliation sanctions.""

As a result of the channel's failure to produce the requested documents and communications, Judge Marshall has ordered Fox to pay $1,000 per day until it complies with the discovery requests.

In addition, he has announced that he intends to appoint a special master to investigate possible misconduct on the part of Fox, including the deletion of digital evidence.

The special master would have the authority to review any documents or communications that Fox has failed to produce, as well as conduct interviews with Fox employees and contractors.

The judge's decision is a significant setback for Fox's defense in the Dominion lawsuit. The channel had argued that its coverage of the election fraud conspiracy theories was protected under the First Amendment, and that it had not made any false statements about Dominion.

However, the missing evidence raises questions about the veracity of Fox's claims, and suggests that the channel may have engaged in deliberate efforts to discredit Dominion.

The ruling also marks a victory for Dominion, which has faced a barrage of false claims and conspiracy theories since the 2020 presidential election.

The company has steadfastly denied the allegations, and has argued that its voting machines are secure and accurate. However, the baseless claims have had a significant impact on Dominion's reputation, and have even led to threats against its employees.

In response to the judge's ruling, Dominion issued a statement praising the decision and vowing to hold Fox accountable for its actions.

""Today's ruling is an important step forward in our efforts to hold Fox News accountable for its role in spreading lies and misinformation about Dominion,"" the statement read. ""We remain committed to pursuing justice in this case, and to restoring our company's reputation.""

Fox News, for its part, has expressed confidence in its defense, despite the judge's ruling.

""The Court's ruling today is hardly the final word in the case,"" a Fox spokesperson said in a statement. ""We are confident that Fox will ultimately prevail on the merits.""

The spokesperson also dismissed the judge's decision to appoint a special master, calling it ""unnecessary and inappropriate.""

""The Court's decision to appoint a special master is unjustified, given that Fox has already produced thousands of pages of documents, and we look forward to making that fact clear as the case continues to unfold,"" the statement read.

The Dominion lawsuit is expected to be a lengthy and complex legal battle, with both sides already engaging in extensive discovery and motion practice.

However, Judge Marshall's ruling suggests that Fox News may face an uphill battle in convincing the court that its coverage of the Dominion conspiracy theories was protected under the First Amendment.

If the channel is found to have engaged in deliberate efforts to discredit Dominion, it could face significant damages in the lawsuit, as well as further damage to its already-tarnished reputation as a reliable source of news.

The appointment of a special master to investigate possible misconduct by Fox could also lead to further revelations about the channel's role in spreading false and misleading information to its viewers.

Ultimately, the Dominion lawsuit may prove to be a turning point in the battle against election-related disinformation, and a wake-up call to media organizations about their responsibility to report the truth and uphold the principles of democracy.",1
226,"At least 3 people were shot during a confrontation at a mall food court in Delaware, police say","At least 3 people were shot during a confrontation at a mall food court in Delaware, police say.

According to authorities, the shooting occurred on Saturday evening at the Concord Mall in Wilmington. The mall, situated off Concord Pike, was crowded with shoppers and diners at the time of the incident.

Police received multiple 911 calls reporting the shooting at around 4:50 p.m. Responding officers found three people suffering from gunshot wounds.

The victims were taken to the hospital, where they are currently receiving medical treatment. Police have not released any information regarding their condition at this time.

The suspects involved in the shooting reportedly fled the scene before the police arrived. However, authorities have stated that they are pursuing multiple leads in connection with the incident.

The investigation is ongoing, and police have asked anyone with information regarding the shooting to come forward and contact them.

According to eyewitnesses, the shooting occurred at the mall's food court, which was packed with people at the time. Many shoppers and diners reported hearing loud gunshots followed by screams and chaos.

""I was at the food court with my family when we heard gunshots. We all ran towards the mall exit. It was very scary,"" said a witness who wished to remain anonymous.

Another witness stated that she saw the suspects flee the scene after the shooting. ""I saw two men running away from the food court area. They looked like they were in a hurry to get away,"" she said.

The Concord Mall remained closed for the rest of the evening as police continued their investigation. It is unclear when the mall will reopen.

An increasing number of shootings have occurred in public places in the United States in recent years. Earlier this year, several mass shootings took place in shopping malls, movie theaters, and other public venues.

Gun control continues to be a controversial issue in the United States, with advocates for stricter gun laws claiming that tighter regulations would reduce the number of shootings. However, opponents argue that such laws violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to bear arms.

Mass shootings have become a common occurrence in the United States, with an average of one incident per day so far this year. In the wake of this latest shooting incident, many are calling for lawmakers to take action to reduce the number of shootings in public places.

Delaware Governor John Carney issued a statement following the shooting, expressing his condolences to the victims and their families. ""Our thoughts are with those affected by this tragic incident. We urge anyone with information on this shooting to come forward and assist authorities in their investigation,"" he said.

The governor also called for closer cooperation between law enforcement agencies and community organizations to address gun violence and other crimes.

The Concord Mall shooting has once again highlighted the need for increased security measures at public places in the United States. Many malls and other public venues have already implemented additional security measures, such as metal detectors and increased surveillance, in an effort to prevent shootings.

However, opponents of such steps argue that they are costly and invasive, and that they do not necessarily prevent shootings from occurring.

In any case, it is clear that something must be done to reduce the number of shootings in public places in the United States. Whether through stricter gun laws, increased security measures, or a combination of both, the safety of citizens must be paramount.

As the investigation into the Concord Mall shooting continues, authorities are urging anyone with information about the incident to contact the police. It is crucial that those responsible for this terrible act be brought to justice, and that steps are taken to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.",1
227,"A labor market cooldown: US economy added just 236,000 jobs in March","A labor market cooldown: US economy added just 236,000 jobs in March

The latest jobs report has brought a sobering reality for the US economy, as only 236,000 jobs were added in March. This is a significant decrease from the February figures, where 468,000 jobs were added. Analysts warn that the slowdown in job growth is not surprising, with the pandemic still raging across the country and many states still struggling to vaccinate their populations.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate fell to 6% in March, down from the February rate of 6.2%. However, many experts caution that the drop in the unemployment rate is not a true reflection of the state of the labor market. This is because the labor force participation rate remained unchanged at 61.5%, meaning that many people are still not actively seeking employment.

The disappointing job growth figures have caused concern among experts, who warn that the recovery may take longer than anticipated. The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the US economy, with millions of people losing their jobs and businesses closing down. While the vaccine rollout is underway, the road to recovery is expected to be long and arduous.

The leisure and hospitality sector, which was hit hardest by the pandemic, added 280,000 jobs in March. This is welcome news, given that the sector has been among the slowest to recover. However, many other sectors saw little or no job growth, highlighting the uneven nature of the recovery.

The manufacturing sector added 53,000 jobs, while construction added 110,000 jobs. These sectors have been relatively resilient during the pandemic, but experts warn that they too are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand and supply chains disruptions.

One sector that has been particularly affected is the retail sector, which lost 23,000 jobs in March. This is a worrying sign, given that the sector is a major employer in the US. Many brick-and-mortar stores have struggled to survive the pandemic, with many consumers opting for online shopping instead.

The job growth figures also revealed a disturbing trend among women, who saw little job growth in March. This is particularly concerning, given that women have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Many women have had to leave the workforce to care for children or elderly relatives, and the lack of job growth in March will only exacerbate their financial struggles.

The BLS also reported that the average hourly earnings for all employees increased by 4 cents to $29.96 in March. This marks a 4.2% increase from March 2020. While the increase in wages is welcome news for workers, it is also a reflection of the tight labor market, with employers having to offer higher wages to attract workers.

The latest jobs report is a stark reminder that the US economy is still in the midst of the pandemic. While the vaccine rollout may offer some hope for the future, the recovery is likely to be slow and uneven. Many businesses and workers are still struggling, and the government will need to provide continued support to help them weather the storm.

President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which was passed earlier this month, is a step in the right direction, offering much-needed relief to millions of Americans. The plan includes $1,400 stimulus checks, extended unemployment benefits, and funding for small businesses. However, some experts warn that more needs to be done to ensure a sustainable recovery.

One area that could use more attention is the education sector. The pandemic has highlighted inequalities in the education system, with many students struggling to access remote learning and falling further behind. The government could invest more in education, offering funding for schools and universities to help them adapt to the changing landscape.

Another area that could use more support is the healthcare sector, which has been stretched to its limits during the pandemic. The government could offer additional funding to support healthcare workers and ensure that hospitals and clinics have the resources they need.

Ultimately, the road to recovery will require sustained effort and support from the government and the private sector. The latest jobs report is a wake-up call, reminding us that the pandemic is far from over and that we must continue to work together to overcome its many challenges.",1
228,"5 things to know for April 13: Food prices, Trump, Leaked docs, Abortion, North Korea","5 things to know for April 13: Food prices, Trump, Leaked docs, Abortion, North Korea

As we move through April, several major stories are making headlines. From rising food prices to leaked documents, here are the five top stories to know for April 13.

1. Food prices are on the rise

In a sign of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, food prices are surging around the world. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, global food prices rose for the 10th consecutive month in March, hitting their highest level in nearly seven years.

The rise in prices has been attributed to a number of factors, including supply chain disruptions, weather-related challenges, and increased demand from consumers. Some of the hardest-hit food items include meat, dairy, and grains.

For consumers, rising food prices are likely to translate into higher grocery bills and tighter budgets. In some parts of the world, the food price increases could also exacerbate existing food insecurity and hunger.

2. Trump continues to stir up controversy

Former President Donald Trump remains in the spotlight as he continues to make headlines with controversial remarks and actions.

In recent weeks, Trump has taken aim at a range of targets, from Republican leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to corporations such as Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines. He has also faced criticism for divisive comments about minorities and for continuing to promote false claims about the 2020 election.

The ongoing controversy surrounding Trump underscores the deep divisions within the US political landscape and the challenges facing the Republican Party as it seeks to chart a path forward.

3. Leaked documents put a spotlight on billionaires

A trove of leaked financial documents known as the ""Pandora Papers"" is shedding light on the financial practices of some of the world's wealthiest individuals and entities.

The documents, which were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), reveal details about offshore investments, real estate holdings, and other assets held by billionaires, politicians, and other prominent figures around the world.

The Pandora Papers have already led to calls for increased scrutiny of offshore tax havens and for greater transparency in financial dealings. Some have also called for increased regulation of the global financial system to prevent the sort of wealth concentration and tax avoidance revealed in the leaked documents.

4. Abortion rights face new challenges

The battle over abortion rights is heating up once again, as several states move to enact increasingly restrictive abortion laws.

In Texas, a new law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy is set to take effect in September, even as other states consider similar measures. Proponents of the laws argue that they are needed to protect the rights of the unborn, while opponents warn that they will lead to dangerous back-alley abortions and violate women's constitutional rights.

The renewed push to restrict abortion rights is likely to trigger a new round of legal battles and political debates, as both sides seek to make their voices heard.

5. North Korea poses new threats

As tensions continue to simmer on the Korean Peninsula, North Korea is making headlines once again with a series of provocative actions.

In recent weeks, North Korea has launched a series of missile tests, including one that reportedly involved a new type of long-range missile. The country has also reportedly restarted a nuclear reactor that could be used to produce material for nuclear weapons.

The renewed threats from North Korea come amid ongoing negotiations between the country and the international community over its nuclear program. While tensions have ebbed and flowed in the past, the latest round of escalations highlights the ongoing challenges of managing one of the most volatile and unpredictable global hotspots.

Conclusion

From rising food prices to the ongoing controversies surrounding Donald Trump, these are the five stories to watch for on April 13th. While each of these stories is complex and multifaceted, they all underscore the challenges and uncertainties facing the world in 2021. As we move through the year ahead, it is clear that these issues will continue to shape the news and shape our world in ways both large and small.",1
229,'Til Death Do Us Part: Kourtney & Travis' gives a behind-the-scenes look at their weddings,"Singer and reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian and musician Travis Barker recently tied the knot in a private ceremony that was nothing short of high-octane glamour.

The couple, who got engaged in July, exchanged vows on October 17, 2021. The ceremony, which took place in the backyard of Kris Jenner's luxurious mansion in Hidden Hills, California, was filled with over-the-top displays of affection and endless elegance.

Although the couple initially revealed very little about their special day, they have now given fans a behind-the-scenes look at their wedding, and it’s nothing short of incredible.

The bride wore an exquisite custom-made Vera Wang wedding dress, which took more than six months to create. The dress featured a plunging neckline and fitted bodice, with a full skirt that billowed out behind her as she walked down the aisle. Kourtney completed her look with a stunning headpiece of white roses, a throwback to her Sicilian heritage.

The groom, on the other hand, opted for an all-black suit paired with a white shirt and a black tie with silver studs. Barker wore a custom-made Dior Homme suit designed by Kim Jones.

Guests were said to have been blown away by the stunning decor at the ceremony. Flowers hung from the ceiling, with lights twinkling in the background, creating a magical ambiance. The couple's friends and family members were seated at rectangular tables adorned with beautiful centerpieces and candlelights.

The ceremony itself was a mix of tradition and innovation. The groom's two children, Landon and Alabama, walked down the aisle before Kourtney made her grand entrance. The couple exchanged vows as a live orchestra played beautiful melodies in the background.

The ceremony was officiated by none other than the couple's dear friend, Kris Jenner. The bride's sister, Kim Kardashian, gave a heartfelt speech before the newlyweds made their exit, with rose petals raining down on them.

After the ceremony, the celebration continued with an unforgettable reception that included a live performance from Machine Gun Kelly, who played a setlist of his biggest hits. The stage was set up by none other than infamous stage designer Nick DeMoura, who has worked with fellow superstars Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.

Meanwhile, Barker and Kourtney hit the dance floor, showing off their signature moves as they danced the night away. The couple looked radiant, and their love for each other was evident in every move.

The wedding's theme was black and white, and guests were asked to adhere to the dress code. The couple seemingly wanted to create a timeless, classic environment that would be remembered for years to come.

In a recent interview, Kourtney and Travis revealed that their wedding was an intimate and emotional affair, with the only people who mattered most in attendance.

Kourtney described the day as everything she could have ever wanted in a wedding, adding that it was ""a day filled with love, laughter, and a lot of tears. I feel so lucky to have married my best friend in front of our family and friends.""

Travis echoed her sentiments, saying, ""I married the love of my life. Kourtney is everything I ever wanted in a wife, and I can't believe I get to wake up every day with her by my side.""

The couple has been inseparable since going public with their relationship earlier this year, with both Kourtney and Travis giving fans a glimpse into their daily lives through social media.

Kourtney has been open about how much Travis has changed her life, saying that she's grateful for him every day. The couple's relationship has been intense from the start, with the two going public with their love in January and getting tattooed with each other's names in February.

Their intense love for each other has been evident in every public appearance and social media post they have shared over the past year, so it came as no surprise when the couple decided to tie the knot.

Kourtney and Travis said that they wanted their wedding to be reflective of their love for each other, and that's precisely what they got. The couple's wedding was as unique as their love story, with no detail left unturned.

The couple's marriage marks the beginning of a new chapter in their lives together. Kourtney has three children with her ex-partner Scott Disick, while Travis has two children with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler.

The couple has already been open about their desire to expand their family, with both Kourtney and Travis saying that they want to have more children together.

The couple has been living together since early this year, with Kourtney sharing that she's been renovating her Calabasas home to make it more family-friendly for her kids.

The couple's wedding, as extravagant as it was, was only for their closest friends and family. However, fans can still get a glimpse of Kourtney and Travis' love story in the latest season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, as well as on their respective social media pages.

From the couple's adorable photoshoots to their romantic vacations, Kourtney and Travis have been giving fans an inside look at their whirlwind love story. Nevertheless, their wedding was undoubtedly the most remarkable display of their love to date, and fans are left wondering how the couple will top it in the years to come.

With Kourtney and Travis' shared love for music, art, and all things creative, it’s safe to assume that their future together will be nothing short of adventurous and unforgettable. But for now, the couple's wedding will forever remain a beautiful memory of their everlasting love. Til death do them apart, indeed.",1
230,Hollywood writers hold strike vote Tuesday,"Hollywood writers hold strike vote Tuesday

On Tuesday, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) held a strike authorization vote, which could lead to a work stoppage for television and film writers. The vote comes after months of negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) failed to reach a new agreement on a contract.

The WGA represents over 15,000 writers in the entertainment industry, including those who write for television shows and movies. Their current contract with the AMPTP, which covers areas such as wages, health care, and working conditions, expired on May 1, 2020. Negotiations between the two parties began in March of this year, but have been stalled for several months.

One of the main sticking points in the negotiations has been the issue of streaming residuals. With the rise of streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon, writers are concerned about the lack of compensation they receive for their work being streamed online. The WGA is pushing for increases in streaming residuals, while the AMPTP is pushing back, citing the uncertain nature of the streaming market.

Other issues being negotiated include an increase in minimum pay rates for television and feature films, improvements to health care and pension benefits, and reducing the number of long workdays on television shows.

If the WGA votes to authorize a strike, it would give the guild's leadership the ability to call for a work stoppage if necessary. This would affect not only writers, but also other industries such as production crews, actors, and directors who rely on the entertainment industry for work.

The last time the WGA went on strike was in 2007-2008, which lasted for 100 days and cost the industry an estimated $1.5 billion. During that time, many television shows went on hiatus, and several movies were delayed or cancelled. The strike also had a ripple effect throughout the industry, affecting businesses such as caterers, hotels, and transportation companies that rely on production crews for business.

In preparation for the strike vote, the WGA has been holding meetings and rallies in Los Angeles and New York to inform its members about the issues at stake. Several high-profile writers, such as Aaron Sorkin, Shonda Rhimes, and Lena Waithe, have publicly supported the strike authorization vote on social media, calling for fair compensation for writers.

Some writers have expressed concern about the potential impact of a strike on their careers, as well as the economic consequences for others in the industry. However, many are also frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations and the lack of progress on key issues.

Negotiations between the WGA and the AMPTP are scheduled to resume on August 31, but the outcome of the strike authorization vote could have a significant impact on the bargaining power of the guild's leadership.

The entertainment industry has already been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many productions shut down for several months earlier this year. A strike could further disrupt the industry and exacerbate already difficult economic conditions for many in the entertainment industry.

As the WGA prepares to announce the results of the strike vote, many are watching closely to see what the future holds for the entertainment industry and the thousands of people who make their livelihoods in it.",1
231,Hear why Navalny's team believes the Putin critic could have been poisoned in prison,"Amid a blue-sky summer day, Alexei Navalny returned to Russia in January from Germany, where he was receiving treatment after a nerve-agent poisoning he claims was orchestrated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has categorically denied the allegations.

Now, prison authorities in Russia have informed Navalny's lawyers that they believe he has been severely uncooperative and has broken the terms of his probation order. As a result, they transferred Navalny to penal colony Number 2, east of Moscow.

Navalny's legal team has claimed that the move was carried out in an effort to silence him as the Putin critic continues to call for mass protests against the Moscow government.

But what has sparked the newest wave of concern is that on Monday, Navalny's Instagram account detailed his experiences in prison, including that he had developed a rash and a fever. His team is now concerned that he may have been exposed to poison in the prison facility.

Navalny's lawyer, Olga Mikhailova, also reported on Telegram that her client had started to suffer a cough and a third finger on his left hand was becoming numb.

His team has believed that he had not been poisoned during his current imprisonment, but rather during the time he was in the hospital in Omsk -- where he was initially taken for medical attention after he fell ill on a plane last August -- or when he visited the toilet in his cell shortly after being transferred to the penal colony.

Navalny is serving a sentence for violating his parole in a 2014 fraud case. He has always maintained that the charges were politically motivated and was deemed a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International.

The Russian government has previously denied accusations of playing a role in Navalny's poisoning. In a meeting with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, Putin dismissed the allegation as ""whipped-up"" hysteria that was aimed at discrediting him.

With Navalny's team now concerned that he may have been exposed to poison once again, there have been increasing calls from world leaders for his release and for Russia to fully cooperate with an investigation into the poisoning.",1
232,Millie Bobby Brown and Jake Bongiovi hint they're engaged,"Millie Bobby Brown, the 17-year-old British actress who rose to fame as the telekinetic Eleven on the hit Netflix series ""Stranger Things,"" has been in the public eye since her breakout role in 2016. Her latest news, however, has nothing to do with her acting career, but instead, with her rumoured engagement to Jake Bongiovi, the son of singer Jon Bon Jovi.

The couple has been dating for a few months since they first met on a trip to the Bahamas earlier this year. They have been spotted together at various events, including a vacation in Cabo San Lucas and a Wimbledon match.

Rumours surrounding their relationship started to heat up when Brown shared a photo on Instagram of her and Bongiovi with the caption ""bffs."" However, fans quickly picked up on the fact that both of them were wearing rings on their ring fingers, sparking speculation that they may have secretly gotten engaged.

The rumours intensified when Brown and Bongiovi were spotted together at a New York City jewelry store, where they reportedly spent several hours browsing engagement rings. This led to many people speculating that an engagement announcement was imminent.

Neither Brown nor Bongiovi have officially confirmed their engagement, but they have both dropped hints on social media. On July 31st, Bongiovi shared a photo of himself and Brown on Instagram with the caption ""my love,"" along with a heart emoji. Shortly after, Brown posted a photo of herself and Bongiovi with the caption ""happy place,"" along with a ring emoji.

Fans have been quick to point out that the ring emoji could be a nod to her engagement ring, which has yet to be revealed to the public.

The news of Brown's rumored engagement to Bongiovi has been met with mixed reactions from fans. While many are happy for the couple and wish them all the best, others are concerned that Brown is too young to get engaged.

At just 17 years old, Brown is still in the early stages of her career and has a bright future ahead of her. Some fans feel that getting engaged at such a young age could be a mistake, and that Brown should focus on her career and personal growth before settling down.

Others, however, believe that Brown is mature for her age and should be allowed to make her own decisions. They argue that age is just a number, and that if Brown and Bongiovi are truly in love, they should be able to get engaged if they want to.

It's worth noting that Brown is not the first celebrity to get engaged at a young age. Stars like Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, and Demi Lovato all got engaged in their early twenties, and while some of those relationships didn't last, others have stood the test of time.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to get engaged is a personal one that should be made by the individuals involved. If Brown and Bongiovi are truly in love and committed to each other, then age should not be a factor in their decision to take the next step in their relationship.

For now, fans will have to wait and see if Brown and Bongiovi will officially confirm their engagement. But if the rumours are true, then we wish them all the happiness and love in the world as they embark on this exciting new chapter in their lives together.",1
233,A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise,"As the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists and researchers around the globe have been racing against time to develop a vaccine to curb the spread of the virus. While several vaccine candidates are under clinical trials, a new approach to a Covid-19 vaccine shows early promise as it targets the nose, which is the primary gateway for the virus to enter the body.

The nasal vaccine, developed by a team at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, uses a weakened form of the virus to stimulate the immune system's response. Unlike traditional injectable vaccines that target the bloodstream, this vaccine targets the mucosal immune system that lines the nose and lungs.

Dr. Frances Lund, the director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Medical Scientist Training Program, explained that the nasal vaccine's approach targets the part of the immune system that is on the front line of defense against respiratory diseases.

""The mucosal immune system is the body's first line of defense against respiratory infections,"" Lund said. ""If we can stimulate that with our vaccine, we can have a powerful impact in stopping the spread of Covid-19.""

The vaccine uses a weakened adenovirus to deliver genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. The adenovirus has been altered so that it cannot replicate or cause disease, but it can still stimulate the immune system to produce an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Early studies of the vaccine have shown promising results. In animal studies, the vaccine was found to be safe and well-tolerated, with few side effects. The vaccine also stimulated an immune response that protected the animals from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

In a study published in Science Translational Medicine, the team reported that the nasal vaccine induced strong and broad immune responses in non-human primates. The vaccine was found to be effective in preventing Covid-19 infection after a single dose.

""Our study shows that a single intranasal dose of our vaccine can provide robust protection against Covid-19,"" Lund said.

The nasal vaccine's approach has several advantages over traditional injectable vaccines. Because it targets the mucosal immune system, it can stimulate local immunity in the nose and lungs, which are the primary sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach can also provide protection against future Covid-19 variants by targeting the virus's spike protein.

Another advantage of the nasal vaccine is its potential for needle-free administration, which could make it easier and safer for large-scale vaccination programs. This approach could also be more acceptable to people who are afraid of needles or have needle phobia.

The nasal vaccine's approach is not entirely new. Similar approaches have been used for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and measles, with promising results. However, it is the first time that the approach has been used for a coronavirus vaccine.

As promising as the nasal vaccine's approach is, there are still several hurdles to overcome before it can be approved for widespread use. The vaccine is currently in phase 1 clinical trials, which are testing its safety and efficacy in humans. If the vaccine proves to be safe and effective, it will move to larger clinical trials to determine its effectiveness in preventing Covid-19 infection.

In addition, the nasal vaccine's approach may not be suitable for everyone. People with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions may not be able to tolerate the vaccine or may not mount a sufficient immune response. The vaccine may also require multiple doses to provide long-term immunity, which could be challenging for some populations.

Despite these challenges, the nasal vaccine's approach represents a promising avenue for Covid-19 vaccine development. It has the potential to provide strong and broad immunity against Covid-19, target the virus's point of entry, and be administered efficiently and safely. As Covid-19 continues to impact lives and health worldwide, a safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed. The nasal vaccine's approach could play a critical role in achieving that goal.",1
234,"'Beginning of the end' for fossil fuels: Global wind and solar reached record levels in 2022, study finds","In a groundbreaking study, it has been found that 2022 marked a historic year for renewable energy sources. For the first time ever, the total installed capacity of wind and solar energy worldwide surpassed that of fossil fuels, signaling the ""beginning of the end"" for the dirty and unsustainable energy sources that have plagued our planet for far too long.

According to the study, published in the journal Nature Energy, wind and solar energy sources reached a total capacity of 1,200 gigawatts (GW) last year, compared to the 1,100 GW for fossil fuels. This represents a significant milestone in the global push towards a more sustainable energy future and highlights the immense progress that has been made in recent years in the development and deployment of clean energy technologies.

The study also found that new installations of wind and solar energy increased by a staggering 50% in 2022, with almost 250 GW of new capacity added worldwide. This marks the largest year-on-year increase ever recorded, and is a clear indication that the world is waking up to the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels and towards a cleaner, more sustainable future.

The rapid growth of renewable energy sources in recent years has been facilitated by a combination of factors, including technological advancements, government policies and incentives, and rapidly falling prices for renewable energy systems. In many parts of the world, wind and solar energy are now the cheapest sources of new electricity generation, making them the obvious choice for investors and policy-makers alike.

One of the key factors driving the growth of renewable energy sources is the increasing awareness among individuals and communities of the urgent need to address the climate crisis. With global temperatures continuing to rise and extreme weather events becoming more frequent and more severe, the pressure is mounting for nations to take urgent action to reduce their carbon emissions and limit the damage being done to the natural world.

In response to this growing demand for cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, governments around the world have begun to take meaningful action to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels. In Europe, for example, the European Union has set an ambitious target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and has committed to investing heavily in renewable energy systems to help achieve this goal.

Similarly, in the United States, President Joe Biden has made a commitment to achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035, and has unveiled a comprehensive plan to invest in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other clean technologies as part of the country's efforts to tackle climate change.

Despite the clear progress being made in the transition towards renewable energy, however, there are still significant challenges to be overcome. One of the biggest obstacles to the widespread adoption of clean energy systems is the issue of energy storage – the ability to store energy generated by wind and solar systems so that it can be used when demand is highest.

Currently, most renewable energy systems rely on traditional energy grids to distribute electricity to homes and businesses, meaning that excess energy generated during periods of low demand is simply wasted. While energy storage technologies such as batteries and pumped hydro power are becoming increasingly sophisticated and cost-effective, there is still a long way to go before these technologies are able to fully address the issue of energy storage on a global scale.

Another challenge facing the renewable energy sector is the issue of intermittency – the fact that wind and solar energy production can fluctuate depending on the weather and other factors. While this issue has been partially addressed through the development of energy storage technologies and the use of smart grids to manage energy demand, further advancements will be needed if renewable energy sources are to completely replace fossil fuels as the primary source of energy worldwide.

Despite these challenges, however, the continued growth of renewable energy sources represents an unprecedented opportunity to create a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable future for all. By transitioning away from dirty and unsustainable sources of energy and investing heavily in clean, renewable technologies, we can build a world that is not only healthier and more resilient, but also more just and equitable for all.

As the study published in Nature Energy highlights, the era of fossil fuels is coming to an end, and the time has come to embrace a sustainable and prosperous energy future.

235,"Consumers feel credit is getting harder to come by, Fed survey shows","The Federal Reserve's recent survey has shed light on a growing concern among American consumers - credit is getting harder to come by. The study, known as the Household Debt and Credit Report, showed that 35% of those surveyed believe obtaining credit is more difficult now than it was a year ago, compared to just 25% in 2019. The trend is particularly prominent among those with low credit scores and limited access to financial resources.

The survey, which is conducted annually, provides a comprehensive analysis of the borrowing and repayment habits of American households. It covers a wide range of topics, including student loans, auto loans, credit cards, and mortgages. The latest report, which covers the second quarter of 2020, paints a grim picture of the current state of credit access in the country.

According to the report, credit card debt decreased by $82 billion in the second quarter, the largest decline on record. However, this was largely due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many Americans to cut back on discretionary spending. Simultaneously, delinquency rates for credit card debt and auto loans have risen, indicating that many consumers are struggling to manage their debt during the crisis.

The lack of access to credit is particularly concerning for those in lower income brackets, who are more likely to rely on credit to make ends meet. The report found that the percentage of households with credit scores below 620 who are approved for a credit card has fallen from 58% in the second quarter of 2019 to just 48% in the same period this year. This could be due to increased caution on the part of lenders, who are trying to minimize their risk during the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

Another factor is the decrease in the number of credit card applications being processed by lenders. During the peak of the pandemic in April 2020, the number of credit card applications fell to a record low of 3.7 million, down from 6.7 million in April 2019. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including fewer people making discretionary purchases, the closure of many retailers and travel companies, and the tightening of lending standards by credit card issuers.

The Federal Reserve has taken steps to support access to credit during the crisis, including lowering interest rates and increasing liquidity in the banking system. However, these measures may not be sufficient to offset the caution among lenders and the reduction in available credit.

The trend of decreasing credit access could have significant implications for the wider economy. Consumer spending accounts for around two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and if households are unable to access credit, this could lead to a decrease in spending and an economic contraction.

The report also highlights the impact of the pandemic on other types of debt, including student loans and mortgages. While student loan balances have continued to increase, the number of new student loan originations has fallen sharply, indicating that potential borrowers are hesitant to take on new debt. This is particularly concerning given the rising costs of education and the US student debt crisis, which has been a topic of concern for several years.

Mortgage debt has remained stable, but the number of new mortgage originations has fallen due to a combination of economic uncertainty and the difficulty of conducting the necessary paperwork and property inspections during lockdowns. This trend is likely to continue in the coming months, as the economic fallout from the pandemic continues to evolve.

The Federal Reserve's survey is a valuable tool for understanding the current state of household debt and credit access. While the report shows that there is reason for concern, it is important to note that the current situation is largely the result of the pandemic and its economic impact. As the world begins to recover from the crisis, it is likely that credit access will increase, although it may take time for the effects to be felt.

In the short term, however, it is clear that many Americans are struggling to manage their debt and access the credit they need to make ends meet. This is an issue that policymakers and lenders will need to address in order to support the recovery and ensure that households are able to access the credit they need to build a stable financial future.

The Federal Reserve report provides a valuable insight into the challenges facing American households during this difficult time. It is clear that credit access is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly for those with lower credit scores and limited financial resources. As the pandemic continues to evolve, policymakers and lenders will need to work together to ensure that households are able to access the credit they need to weather the storm and build a stable financial foundation for the future.",1
236,Four California sea otters died from an unusual strain of a parasite that could pose a risk to humans,"Four California sea otters have recently died from an unusual strain of a parasite, according to a report by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The deaths have raised concerns about the potential risk this parasite could pose to humans as well.

The California sea otter is a species that has been the focus of conservation efforts for many years, as it has been listed as an endangered species since 1977. These otters, which are native to the California coast, help to maintain the health and diversity of coastal ecosystems. However, their small population size and reliance on near-shore habitats have made them vulnerable to various threats, including pollution, habitat loss, and disease.

According to the report, the four sea otters were found to have died from a parasitic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite that is found in warm-blooded animals worldwide. Although Toxoplasma gondii is common in many animals, including humans, this particular strain found in the sea otters was unusual in that it was highly virulent and had never been seen before.

The discovery of this new strain of the parasite has raised concerns among scientists and wildlife officials, who fear that it could pose a significant risk to both animal and human health. Toxoplasma gondii is known to cause a disease in humans called toxoplasmosis, which can have serious and even fatal consequences, especially for people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women, and young children.

While the transmission of toxoplasmosis from sea otters to humans is not yet fully understood, it is possible that contaminated water and seafood could be a source of infection. Sea otters are known to eat a variety of seafood, including clams, mussels, and crabs, which can sometimes contain the parasite. Additionally, humans can become infected by handling contaminated soil or feces from infected animals.

Toxoplasmosis is not a new disease, and it is estimated that around one-third of the world's population is infected with the parasite. However, the severity of the disease can vary depending on the strain of the parasite, and this new strain found in the sea otters is of particular concern.

""Sea otters are an important sentinel species for us, because they are exposed to the same types of pollutants and pathogens that we are,"" said Melissa Miller, a wildlife veterinarian with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, in a statement. ""If we see something affecting sea otters, it's highly likely that it could be impacting us as well.""

In addition to the potential health risks to humans, the deaths of these sea otters are also a blow to conservation efforts. The loss of just four otters may not seem like a significant number, but given the small population size of this endangered species, every individual is important.

According to the latest census data, there are only around 3,000 sea otters left in California, and their numbers are declining. The causes of this decline are complex and multifaceted, with factors such as pollution, habitat loss, and disease all playing a role.

The discovery of this new strain of Toxoplasma gondii highlights the need for continued research and monitoring of this vulnerable species. Efforts to protect sea otters from pollution, habitat loss, and other threats must be intensified to ensure their survival.

In addition, more needs to be done to understand and mitigate the health risks of toxoplasmosis for both animals and humans. This may involve increased testing and monitoring of seafood for the presence of the parasite, as well as public awareness campaigns to educate people about the disease and how to prevent infection.

While the deaths of these four sea otters are a tragedy, they also serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting our natural world and the species that inhabit it. As our impact on the environment continues to grow, it is more important than ever to take action to reduce our negative impact and ensure a sustainable future for all.

In conclusion, the discovery of this unusual strain of Toxoplasma gondii in sea otters is a cause for concern, not only for the health of these endangered animals but also for the potential risks it could pose to human health. More research and monitoring are needed to better understand this new strain of the parasite and how it could impact both wildlife and human populations. Efforts to protect sea otters and their habitats must be intensified, and steps should be taken to mitigate the risks of toxoplasmosis for both animals and humans. As our world continues to change, it is more important than ever to prioritize the conservation of vulnerable species and the health of our environment.",1
237,Manhattan median rents hit another high in March,"In March 2021, the median rental price in Manhattan hit another all-time high. This is the latest evidence of the turbulent real estate market in the US' largest city, which is facing a pandemic recovery as well as a major shift in attitudes towards urban living.

According to a report from real estate listing site StreetEasy, the median monthly rent in Manhattan was $3,071 in March. This represents a 3.7% increase from February, and an 8.2% increase from the same month last year. The previous record high was set in January 2020, just before the pandemic began.

As New York City continues to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, this surge in rental prices is raising questions about the future of Manhattan's housing market. Some experts are predicting a post-pandemic exodus from crowded urban areas to more spacious suburban locales, while others believe that Manhattan's cultural and economic appeal will remain strong.

""Manhattan's real estate market is always in flux, but the pandemic has created some unique challenges and opportunities,"" says Eric Benaim, CEO of real estate brokerage firm Modern Spaces. ""Right now, we're seeing a lot of demand for larger apartments with outdoor space, as well as properties in more affordable neighborhoods like Washington Heights and Inwood.""

Indeed, the StreetEasy report indicates that some of the city's more expensive neighborhoods have seen declines in rental prices over the past year. For example, rents in Tribeca fell by 14.6% compared to March 2020, while the Upper East Side saw a 7.2% drop. Meanwhile, rents in more affordable areas such as Washington Heights and Inwood rose by double digits.

This trend is consistent with broader patterns in the US housing market, where the pandemic has accelerated existing disparities. Homebuyers and renters with higher incomes and more stable jobs have been able to take advantage of record-low mortgage rates and rising home values, while those with lower incomes and less job security have struggled to keep up with rising rental costs.

For example, a recent report from the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that a full-time worker making minimum wage cannot afford a two-bedroom apartment in any state in the US. In New York City, the minimum hourly wage is $15, which equates to an annual income of around $31,000. A person making this amount would need to spend more than 80% of their income on rent in order to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan.

""The pandemic has highlighted the deep inequalities in our housing system,"" says Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. ""We need bold action from policymakers to address these disparities and ensure that everyone has access to safe, affordable housing.""

However, not everyone believes that government intervention is the answer to Manhattan's housing crisis. Some experts argue that the best way to address rising rental prices is to create more housing supply.

""The root cause of Manhattan's affordability problem is a severe shortage of housing,"" says Benaim. ""We need to build more homes in order to meet the demand from both existing residents and newcomers. This will require a multifaceted approach that involves zoning reform, public-private partnerships, and community engagement.""

Indeed, there are signs that policymakers and developers are beginning to take steps to address New York City's housing shortage. In January, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan to build 300,000 affordable apartments by 2026, while the state legislature is currently considering a bill that would eliminate single-family zoning in New York City and allow for more diverse housing types in residential neighborhoods.

Despite these efforts, however, the future of Manhattan's housing market remains uncertain. The pandemic has upended traditional concepts of urban living, with remote work and social distancing making many city dwellers reevaluate their priorities. At the same time, however, New York City remains a global cultural and financial hub, with no shortage of attractions for those who can afford to live there.

""Manhattan has always been a city of contrasts, and that's never been more true than it is now,"" says Benaim. ""We're seeing both challenges and opportunities in the real estate market, and I believe that the future of Manhattan's housing market will be shaped by a wide range of factors, from economic trends to social and cultural shifts.""",1
238,Arkansas governor signs sweeping bill imposing a minimum age limit for social media usage,"Arkansas Governor Signs Sweeping Bill Imposing a Minimum Age Limit for Social Media Usage

In today's digital age, social media has become a ubiquitous part of modern life. It's where we connect with friends and family, share our thoughts and experiences, and stay up-to-date on current events. But with this constant connection comes potential dangers, especially for young children who may not fully understand the consequences of their online actions. This is why Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson recently signed a sweeping bill that imposes a minimum age limit for social media usage.

The new law, which is set to take effect on January 1, 2022, requires social media platforms to verify the age of users during account creation and prohibits them from knowingly allowing anyone under the age of 13 to create an account or have access to their platform. This is a significant departure from the current system, where many social media sites only require users to enter their date of birth to verify their age, making it easy for children to lie about their age and gain access to potentially dangerous content.

The bill was sponsored by State Senator Jon Woods and has received widespread support from both sides of the political aisle. Governor Hutchinson praised the bill as a necessary step in protecting young children from cyberbullying, online predators, and exposure to inappropriate content.

""We know that social media can be a powerful tool for positive change, but it can also bring great harm to our children,"" said Hutchinson in a statement. ""By imposing a minimum age limit, we are taking a critical step towards ensuring the safety of our young people.""

Under the new law, social media platforms must also provide parents or legal guardians with the ability to request the deletion of any personal information pertaining to their child. Additionally, the law allows for civil penalties against social media platforms that violate the provisions of the law, with fines ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation.

Supporters of the new law say it's long overdue, especially in light of recent data privacy scandals and the rise of cyberbullying. In a statement, State Senator Woods said the bill's goal is ""to protect children from the long-term risks of social media addiction, bullying, and predatory behavior.""

Opponents of the bill argue that it interferes with parents' ability to make decisions about their children's online use and social media companies' ability to operate freely. Some have also criticized the age limit of 13, saying it's arbitrary and ignores the fact that many children under that age already have social media accounts.

However, supporters of the law say it's about protecting children and ensuring they have a safe online environment. As Arkansas First Lady Susan Hutchinson said, ""Social media can be a wonderful tool, but we have to make sure it's being used appropriately and that our children are not being put at unnecessary risk.""

Several other states have considered similar legislation in the past, and some have already implemented age limits on social media usage. California and Vermont, for example, have laws that prohibit social media companies from collecting or sharing the personal information of minors without parental consent. But Arkansas' law is the first to require platforms to verify the age of users during account creation and prohibit access to anyone under the age of 13.

The new law also raises questions about the role of technology in our lives and the balance between privacy and safety. Many parents rely on social media as a way to stay connected with their children and monitor their online activity, but some worry that the law could limit their ability to do so.

""We need to find a balance between privacy and safety,"" said Sarah Roberts, a parent and tech industry expert. ""There's no doubt that social media poses risks, but we have to be careful not to overregulate and stifle innovation.""

Regardless of the potential challenges and concerns, the new law in Arkansas is a significant step towards ensuring that children have a safe online environment. As more and more young people become active on social media, it's essential that we continue to examine the implications of their online activity and work together to protect them from cyber threats.",1
239,Some customers are complaining the new olive oil-infused Starbucks drink is making them run to the bathroom,"Some customers are complaining the new olive oil-infused Starbucks drink is making them run to the bathroom. The Olive Oil Latte, a new menu item introduced by the coffee giant, has stirred controversy among some customers who say they've experienced gastrointestinal distress after drinking it.

Starbucks launched the Olive Oil Latte in stores across the United States in late January. The latte is made with a shot of espresso and steamed milk, but unlike a regular latte, it's also infused with a hint of olive oil. The coffee chain said the new beverage was inspired by Italian coffee bars and intended to offer a unique and sophisticated taste.

However, some customers who have tried the Olive Oil Latte say they've experienced digestive issues such as diarrhea and stomach cramps after drinking it. Many took to social media to voice their complaints, with some describing the latte as ""disgusting"" and ""gross.""

One Twitter user wrote, ""Just tried the olive oil latte and now I am trapped in the bathroom with terrible diarrhea. Thanks, Starbucks!"" Another user tweeted, ""I thought the olive oil latte would be a good idea, but my stomach was in knots for hours after drinking it.""

Debating the Effects

The complaints have sparked a debate among coffee fans and health experts over the potential digestive effects of olive oil. Many people who have tried the Olive Oil Latte have suggested that the ingredient may be to blame for their stomach issues.

Olive oil is a healthy fat that is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is also a potent laxative that has been used traditionally to treat constipation in Mediterranean cultures. Some experts believe that the laxative effect of olive oil may be responsible for the digestive discomfort reported by some Starbucks customers.

Dr. Jason Tetro, a microbiologist and author who specializes in infectious diseases, said that the Olive Oil Latte may be causing gastrointestinal distress for a different reason. Tetro said that the introduction of oil into the digestive system can stimulate the release of bile, a digestive fluid that helps the body break down fats.

""When bile is released into the small intestine, it can cause cramping, nausea, and diarrhea in some people,"" Tetro said. ""It's possible that the olive oil in the latte is causing this reaction in some customers.""

Of course, there is no way to know exactly what is causing the digestive issues for Olive Oil Latte customers without further study. However, some health experts have pointed out that Starbucks may have introduced the drink without fully considering the potential effects of olive oil on the digestive system.

""Olive oil is a healthy fat, but it can have unintended effects on the digestive system,"" said Dr. Mark Hyman, a functional medicine expert and author. ""It's possible that Starbucks did not take this into account when developing the Olive Oil Latte.""

Starbucks Responds to the Controversy

Starbucks has responded to the controversy over the Olive Oil Latte, saying that the drink is safe and has undergone rigorous testing before being introduced to stores. The coffee chain also said that it has received positive feedback from customers who have tried the latte.

""We take customer feedback seriously, and we are aware of the reports of gastrointestinal distress linked to the Olive Oil Latte,"" Starbucks said in a statement. ""However, the drink has undergone extensive testing and is safe for consumption. We will continue to monitor customer feedback and make any necessary adjustments to the drink as needed.""

Starbucks also emphasized that the drink is an optional menu item and that customers who are concerned about the potential digestive effects of olive oil can still enjoy other menu items.

""We want to assure our customers that the Olive Oil Latte is just one of many drink options available at Starbucks,"" the company said. ""We encourage customers to try it if they are interested but to choose a different drink if they have concerns about the potential digestive effects of the drink.""

Health Experts Weigh In

The controversy over the Olive Oil Latte has sparked a discussion among health experts about the potential health benefits and risks of consuming olive oil. While olive oil is generally considered a healthy ingredient, some experts have pointed out that it can have unintended effects on the digestive system.

Dr. Bradley Schwack, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said that the Olive Oil Latte may be causing gastrointestinal issues for some customers because of the way the oil interacts with other components of the drink.

""Olive oil is a healthy fat, but it can also be difficult to digest when consumed in large quantities,"" Schwack said. ""Additionally, the milk in the latte may be interacting with the olive oil to create digestive discomfort.""

However, Schwack said that there is no reason for customers to avoid the Olive Oil Latte altogether. He recommended that customers who experience digestive issues after drinking the latte try drinking it in smaller quantities or with a meal.

""Like any food or drink, the Olive Oil Latte may not be suitable for everyone,"" Schwack said. ""However, it is generally safe for consumption and can provide health benefits when consumed in moderation.""

Other health experts echoed Schwack's sentiments, saying that the health benefits of olive oil outweigh any potential digestive issues it may cause.

""Olive oil is a key component of the Mediterranean diet, which is known for its numerous health benefits,"" said Dr. Loren Cordain, a nutrition expert and author. ""While some people may experience gastrointestinal issues after consuming olive oil, the vast majority of people can enjoy it safely and reap its health benefits.""

Conclusion

The controversy over the Olive Oil Latte at Starbucks has highlighted the potential health effects of consuming olive oil. While the ingredient is generally considered healthy, some customers have reported experiencing digestive issues after drinking the new latte.

Health experts say that olive oil can have unintended effects on the digestive system and that the way it interacts with other components of the drink may be causing gastrointestinal distress for some customers. However, they also emphasize that the health benefits of olive oil outweigh any potential digestive issues it may cause.

Starbucks has responded to the controversy by saying that the Olive Oil Latte is safe for consumption and has undergone rigorous testing. The coffee chain has also emphasized that the drink is an optional menu item and that customers who are concerned about the potential digestive effects of olive oil can still enjoy other menu items.

Ultimately, the controversy over the Olive Oil Latte serves as a reminder that what we eat and drink can have unintended effects on our bodies. While customers should always feel free to try new food and drink options, it's important to listen to your body and make choices that work best for your individual health and wellness goals.",1

241,Southeastern U.S. cities in greater peril over rising sea levels,"According to a recent report conducted by Climate Central, cities along the southeast coast of the United States are at a greater risk from the rising sea levels caused by climate change. These cities include Miami, Savannah, and Charleston, which have already experienced flooding and high tides that are disrupting the local economies and forcing residents to relocate.

The report predicts that by 2100, if sea levels continue to rise at the current rate, over 13 million Americans will be at risk of flooding. The report attributes the increase in sea levels to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the warming of the oceans.

Miami, in particular, has already begun to feel the impact of the rising sea levels. The city experiences regular flooding and high tides, with some areas being particularly susceptible to damage. This has led to property damage and is even forcing businesses to relocate.

The report highlights the need for policymakers to take action in mitigating the effects of climate change to protect these cities and their residents. This includes reducing CO2 emissions and implementing solutions to prevent further sea-level rise. Local businesses are also urged to consider ways to adapt to the changing climate, such as building higher, more resilient structures.

In conclusion, the rising sea levels caused by climate change are affecting and putting Southeastern cities in greater peril. Without action from policymakers, these cities, their economies, and the residents who call them home, will continue to feel the impact of the rising sea levels.",1
242,Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars files lawsuit against band after touring dispute,"Mick Mars, lead guitarist of rock band Mötley Crüe, has filed a lawsuit against his bandmates, claiming breach of contract and fraud after they allegedly backed out of a touring agreement.

The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, accuses bassist Nikki Sixx, drummer Tommy Lee, and vocalist Vince Neil of reneging on a supposed agreement to embark on a farewell tour in 2020. Mars claims that he had been preparing for the tour and turned down other opportunities as a result of the agreement.

The dispute centers on a clause in a previous contract, which allegedly guaranteed that all members of the band would participate in a final tour before retiring. According to the lawsuit, Mars claims to have honored the agreement while the other members have refused to do so.

“The band made a contract with the four original members that all four would participate in the farewell tour,” the lawsuit reads. “Once again, the band’s three members have acted contrary to their promises and have misled the public for their own benefit.”

Mars is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a declaration that the band is in breach of contract.

Mötley Crüe formed in 1981 and released their debut album, “Too Fast for Love,” in 1982. The band went on to release a string of hits throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s, including “Girls, Girls, Girls,” “Dr. Feelgood,” and “Kickstart My Heart.”

The group disbanded in 2015 but announced their reunion in November 2019, alongside similar announcements from fellow classic rock acts such as Guns N’ Roses and Rage Against the Machine.

A spokesperson for Mötley Crüe did not respond to requests for comment.

The lawsuit has sparked a flurry of reactions among fans and industry experts, many of whom believe that the legal fight may impact the band’s reputation and legacy.

“It’s unfortunate that things have come to this,” said music journalist Mark Brown. “Mötley Crüe is an iconic band and an essential part of rock history, but lawsuits like this have a way of tarnishing the brand and leaving a sour taste in fans’ mouths.”

Others have pointed to the wider implications of the dispute, particularly in terms of the entertainment industry’s reliance on touring revenue amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

“The pandemic has hit the music industry hard, and touring has been one of the most severely affected areas,” noted entertainment lawyer Victoria Smith. “If bands are unable to honor agreements, it could cause a ripple effect throughout the entire industry.”

The lawsuit is just the latest in a series of legal battles involving high-profile musicians this year, including disputes between Taylor Swift and her former label, and Kanye West and his longtime label, Universal Music Group.

As artists become more reliant on touring and live shows, and as the music industry itself continues to evolve, experts suggest that such disputes are likely to become more frequent.

“At the heart of these disputes is usually money,” said Brown. “Contracts and agreements can get messy when there’s a lot of money at stake, and this is true across all industries, not just music.”

For fans of Mötley Crüe, the lawsuit comes as a disappointment, particularly as the band had been preparing to hit the road for a final tour next year.

“Mötley Crüe has always been about putting on a great show and giving fans their money’s worth,” said longtime fan Mike Thompson. “This lawsuit just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and it makes me wonder if we’ll ever get that final tour we were promised.”

Despite the lawsuit, some remain optimistic about a resolution that could see the band fulfill their promise to fans.

“At the end of the day, Mötley Crüe is a band of brothers,” said music blogger Jenny Lee. “They’ve been through a lot together, and I believe that they’ll find a way to work through this and come out stronger on the other side.”",1
243,Warner Bros. Discovery unveils super-streamer 'Max',"For years, the streaming market has been dominated by a select few, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+. But that may all change with the latest announcement from Warner Bros. Discovery, as they unveil their new super-streamer, Max.

Max is set to be a game-changer, combining the content libraries of both Warner Bros. and Discovery under one roof. This means viewers will have access to award-winning shows and movies from networks such as HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures, TNT, Cartoon Network, and HGTV, as well as Discovery Channel, TLC and Animal Planet, all in one place.

David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, expressed his excitement for the new venture, ""Max will bring together the very best of Warner Bros., HBO and Discovery's robust and growing streaming offerings, delivering a deep and differentiated lineup of original programming and blockbuster content.""

The combination of two renowned media companies offers a vast and diverse content library to subscribers. From HGTV's home renovation shows to the gripping drama series on HBO, Max has something for everyone.

HBO has consistently produced critically acclaimed content for years. From ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Sopranos"" to ""Big Little Lies,"" HBO has set the bar for premium content. This is in addition to popular programs like ""Westworld"" and ""Succession,"" both of which have been praised by critics and viewers alike.

Warner Bros. Pictures, the renowned movie studio, also brings a wealth of content to the table. With a collection of incredible blockbusters such as ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Matrix,"" and many more, Max will have plenty for movie lovers to enjoy.

Discovery also has a long history of quality programming. In fact, it's been the No.1 cable network for 33 years, which includes TLC and Animal Planet. This includes popular shows such as ""My 600-lb Life,"" ""Deadliest Catch,"" and ""Dirty Jobs.""

Max doesn't just rely solely on the content from existing networks. They have also created their own original programming to further entice subscribers. Some of the exclusive content to Max includes DC Universe Originals such as Titans, Doom Patrol, and Young Justice, in addition to original series from HBO Max, like the critically acclaimed ""Lovecraft Country.""

Max has also made deals with popular creators including Scooter Braun, Greg Berlanti, Mindy Kaling, and Elizabeth Banks, to bring exclusive content to the platform. This means Max subscribers can look forward to exclusive music events, unscripted programming, and new films.

The price of Max will be $9.99 per month, making it less expensive than competitors such as Netflix and HBO Max.

But with so many streaming giants already in the market, what makes Max stand out? Zaslav believes that it's Max's vast and diverse content library that sets it apart from competitors. ""Max provides tremendous leeway because of the content that's already there, Max will have a library of 200,000 hours of TV episodes and movies — twice what HBO Max has now — and none of it has been available on a streaming platform until now,"" Zaslav said.

However, Max will still have strong competition from established players such as Netflix and Disney+. Netflix has over 208 million monthly subscribers with original movies and series, and Disney+ has over 116 million subscribers with classic Disney content, Marvel, and Star Wars content for viewers of all ages.

Max will also need to compete with other new streaming services launching such as Paramount+, Peacock, and Apple TV+. However, Max has the potential for success as it brings together two well-respected companies with strong followings.

Max is set to launch in June 2022, with plans to roll out globally over time. Max will be available in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Zaslav said, ""We'll see a full launch of Max in June in Latin America and the US, and then over the next year, we will roll it out across Western Europe and adding Asia over the next two years.""

The bottom line is that Max looks to provide a quality alternative in the crowded streaming market. With a massive content library and exclusive original programming, Max has the potential to attract subscribers who are seeking a more diverse selection of top-quality content.

Time will tell how successful Max will be, but one thing's for certain, the streaming wars are far from over, and the competition will only continue to heat up.",1
244,"Autism diagnosis has become more common, but pandemic disrupted early detection, CDC says","As children grow and develop, parents often track their progress and milestones, from first steps to first words. But when these milestones are missed or delayed, it can raise concerns about a child's development. One particular concern that parents may encounter is autism, a complex developmental disorder that can affect social interaction, communication, and behavior.

Over the last few decades, autism diagnosis has become more common. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately one in 54 children in the United States has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), up from one in 150 in 2000. While there is no one definitive cause of autism, experts believe that it may be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Despite the increasing prevalence of autism, the pandemic has disrupted the ability to detect it early, leading to concerns about the long-term impact on affected children.

Early diagnosis and interventions are critical for autism, as research has shown that children who receive early treatment can improve their social and communication skills, as well as reduce challenging behaviors. The CDC recommends that children be screened for developmental delays and disabilities, including autism, at 9, 18, and 24 to 30 months of age.

However, the pandemic has made it challenging for healthcare professionals to conduct regular screenings and assessments, potentially leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Moreover, the pandemic has had a profound impact on families of children with autism, who have faced additional stress and difficulties navigating virtual learning, disruptions to therapy services, and social isolation.

""The pandemic has definitely impacted the ability to provide early detection and treatment for children with autism,"" says Dr. Catherine Lord, a renowned autism researcher and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""It's been a difficult year for everybody, but for families of children with autism, it's been especially challenging.""

Delayed diagnosis and intervention can have long-term consequences for children with autism, affecting their cognitive, social, and emotional development. Delayed diagnosis may also result in increased costs for families due to the need for more intensive and prolonged intervention later on.

""In the short term, delayed diagnosis may not seem like a big deal, but in the long term, it can have significant consequences,"" says Dr. Paul Wang, senior vice president for medical research at the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. ""It's important to address concerns about development as early as possible.""

The pandemic's impact on early detection

The pandemic has disrupted regular pediatric care, resulting in a decrease in well-child visits and an increase in missed vaccinations. In many cases, routine developmental screenings for children have also been postponed or canceled, making it challenging to identify potential developmental delays, including autism, early on.

""During the pandemic, many families have postponed or missed well-child visits, where developmental screening usually happens,"" says Dr. Wendy Chung, director of the clinical genetics program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. ""That can delay the identification of children with developmental delays, including autism.""

Additionally, the effects of social isolation and changes in daily routines caused by the pandemic may have increased susceptibility to mental health issues, particularly for families with children with autism. According to a survey conducted by Autism Speaks in the US, 66% of families reported that their child's care was disrupted by school or therapy service closures, and 64% reported that virtual services were not as effective as in-person services.

""Virtual services can be helpful, but they are not the same as in-person services,"" says Chung. ""Children with autism may have difficulty engaging with the screen and may need more hands-on support. Parents may not have the same level of guidance that they would have in person.""

Additionally, the challenges of virtual learning may exacerbate existing difficulties with communication and social interaction for children with autism. ""Virtual learning has been difficult for everyone, but it may be particularly challenging for children with autism, who may struggle with communication and social interaction,"" says Lord.

According to one study published in the journal Autism Research, children with autism experienced increased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of providing support for mental health and well-being during these challenging times.

Addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic

To address the challenges posed by the pandemic, experts suggest a range of strategies for families and healthcare providers.

One strategy is to prioritize developmental screening and intervention as soon as possible. Children who are at higher risk for autism, such as those with a family history of autism, should receive earlier and more frequent screening. Whereas, primary care providers should make an effort to schedule essential pediatric visits and screenings, even during the pandemic.

""Pediatricians can reach out to families to encourage them to come in for visits, even if they are hesitant or anxious about going to the doctor during the pandemic,"" says Wang. ""They can also provide information and guidance on developmental milestones and red flags for autism.""

Another strategy is to increase access to telehealth services, which have become a critical tool for providing ongoing care during the pandemic. Telehealth can be particularly helpful for families who live in rural or remote areas, where access to healthcare services can be limited.

""Telehealth can be helpful for providing therapy services, as well as for consultation and education for parents and caregivers,"" says Lord.

However, telehealth services are not appropriate for all children with autism, particularly those who require more intensive or hands-on interventions. In these cases, in-person services may be necessary, which requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits of attending in-person appointments.

""Ideally, healthcare providers should work with families to come up with a plan that is tailored to the child's individual needs and circumstances,"" says Lord.

Lastly, experts suggest that it is essential to provide support and resources to families of children with autism. The pandemic has been a stressful and challenging time for all families, but those with children with autism may face additional stressors and difficulty navigating the complexities of virtual learning and disrupted services.

""Support for families is critical, including access to information and resources, as well as emotional support,"" says Wang. ""For many families, the pandemic has been especially difficult, and it's crucial to acknowledge that and provide the support they need.""

An uncertain but hopeful future

While the pandemic has created challenges for early detection and intervention for children with autism, there is hope that ongoing efforts and research in this field will continue to advance and improve outcomes for affected children and their families.

""Autism is a complex disorder, and there is still much we don't know about it,"" says Chung. ""But we have made significant progress in the last few decades, and the more we learn, the better equipped we will be to provide support and interventions.""

Ongoing research is exploring new approaches to detection and treatment, including the use of genetics and biomarkers to identify autism earlier and more accurately. There is also a growing recognition of the need for a more individualized and comprehensive approach to autism, which considers not just the immediate symptoms but also the underlying causes and co-occurring conditions.

""The future of autism care is promising, but it will require ongoing efforts and collaboration,"" says Chung. ""We need to continue to invest in research and resources for families, and to work together to provide the best possible care for children with autism.""

Ultimately, early detection and intervention remain critical for autism, emphasizing the importance of regular developmental screening and ongoing support for affected children and their families. While the pandemic has created significant challenges, these efforts offer hope for a brighter future for individuals with autism and their communities.",1
245,CNN reviewed 53 leaked documents from Pentagon. See what was found,"In an exclusive report, CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents from the Pentagon, shedding light on some of the military's most sensitive operations around the world. The documents, ranging from intelligence reports to defense plans, provide unprecedented insight into the Pentagon's decision-making process, as well as the complex and at times controversial operations undertaken by the US military.

Among the revelations uncovered by the documents are the extent of the US military's involvement in Yemen, despite the lack of an official declaration of war, as well as the use of American troops to train Saudi and Emirati forces despite concerns over human rights abuses.

The documents also paint a picture of frequent miscommunications between the military and the State Department, with several reports noting that the latter was often left out of critical discussions and decisions despite their expertise in areas such as diplomacy and foreign policy.

One of the most concerning findings from the leaked documents was the revelation of a Pentagon plan to use military force to quell protests in the United States. The document, which was labeled as a contingency plan, outlines various scenarios in which the military could be deployed to respond to civil unrest, including the use of lethal force in certain situations.

While the Pentagon has yet to comment on the leak, the documents are sure to raise questions about the US military's role both abroad and at home. Despite facing criticism for its lack of transparency in the past, this latest leak serves as a stark reminder of the need for greater accountability and oversight when it comes to military operations and decision-making.

As more details continue to emerge from the leaked documents, it remains unclear how this latest development will impact the Pentagon's relationship with Congress and the American public. However, one thing is certain: the revelations contained within these documents are sure to spark an important debate about the role of the military and the need for greater transparency in government.",1
246,Moose falls through ice. See what happens next,"A heart-warming tale has emerged from Canada this week, after a group of kind-hearted locals saved the life of a moose who became trapped when he fell through the ice.

The drama unfolded when a young bull moose was spotted wandering across a frozen lake in Belleville, Ontario. Sadly, the ice was thinner than he realised, and he plunged into the icy water below.

Luckily, several locals spotted the stranded animal and leapt into action. They used chainsaws to cut a path through the ice, allowing the moose to swim and climb out back to safety.

Video footage of the rescue was captured and shared on social media, where it has quickly gone viral. Many people have praised the team for their bravery and compassion, saying that their quick thinking saved the moose from a certain death.

Wildlife experts have urged people to be cautious when approaching wild animals, and to never attempt a rescue unless they are suitably qualified and trained.

Meanwhile, the young moose has been spotted back in the wild, apparently none the worse for his ordeal. It's a happy ending to a scary situation - and a reminder that sometimes, even in the toughest of times, kindness and compassion can triumph.",1
247,"Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other major cities could face huge water cuts in feds' proposed plan to save the Colorado River","For decades, the Colorado River has been a vital source of water for millions of people across the southwestern United States. However, as climate change and drought continue to worsen, the river is facing an unprecedented water shortage. To address this imminent crisis, the federal government has proposed a plan that could result in huge water cuts for major cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Phoenix.

The Colorado River is one of the most important rivers in the western United States, flowing over 1,400 miles from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its delta in the Gulf of California. It provides water to over 40 million people across seven states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. The river is also crucial for agriculture, hydropower, and recreation, generating over $1.4 trillion in economic activity.

However, the Colorado River is facing a severe water shortage. The river's annual flow has decreased consistently over the past two decades, and the drought-stricken region is facing another dry year. As a result, the federal government has proposed a plan to reduce water consumption from the river by several states, including California, Arizona, and Nevada.

The plan, called the Colorado River Basin Drought Contingency Plan (DCP), was signed into law earlier this year. The DCP aims to reduce the risk of a water shortage and stabilize water levels in Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States. Under the DCP, several states have agreed to cut their water usage from the Colorado River to prevent critical water levels in Lake Mead from dropping too low.

The proposed water cuts will have a significant impact on cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas, which rely heavily on the Colorado River for their water supply. Los Angeles gets about 70% of its water from the Colorado River, while Las Vegas gets nearly all of its water from the river. The proposed water cuts could result in millions of people in these cities facing severe water shortages.

Experts warn that the current drought is the most severe in over 1,200 years and that climate change could worsen the situation in the future. As such, the federal government is urging states to take further actions to conserve water and reduce their reliance on the Colorado River.

""Climate change is real, and it's here,"" said Brenda Burman, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that oversees water management in the West. ""Our best science tells us that the Colorado River will continue to experience extended droughts in the future. We need to act now to safeguard this critical resource for future generations.""

In response to the water cuts, several cities and states have implemented water conservation measures to reduce their reliance on the Colorado River. In Los Angeles, officials have launched a campaign encouraging residents to reduce their water usage by fixing leaks, turning off sprinklers, and taking shorter showers. In Las Vegas, officials have implemented strict water regulations, including fines for wasting water and limits on outdoor watering.

But experts say that water conservation measures alone may not be enough to prevent a water crisis. They are urging states to invest in long-term solutions like desalination, water recycling, and increased water storage. These solutions could help reduce the reliance on the Colorado River and provide a more sustainable source of water for cities and communities across the West.

""On their own, conservation measures will not be enough to meet the challenges we face,"" said Jeff Kightlinger, the General Manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves over 19 million people in the region. ""We need to find ways to increase our water supply through new technology, increased storage, and better management of our existing resources.""

The proposed water cuts are part of a broader effort to address the water crisis in the Western United States. The region is facing an unprecedented drought, with several states experiencing the worst drought conditions in decades. The situation is expected to worsen over the coming years, as climate change continues to impact the region.

As such, many experts are calling for a more comprehensive approach to water management in the West. They say that the region needs to invest in a more sustainable, long-term water management strategy that takes into account the impact of climate change and the needs of future generations.

""The Colorado River is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Peter Gleick, the President of the Pacific Institute, a water research organization. ""We need a new approach to water management in the West, one that is grounded in science, respects the rights of tribes and communities, and recognizes the urgency of the climate crisis. It's time for bold action.""

As the Colorado River faces a water crisis, the fate of millions of people across the southwestern United States hangs in the balance. The proposed water cuts may be a necessary step to prevent critical water levels in Lake Mead, but they also highlight the urgent need to address the root causes of the crisis. If the region fails to take action now, it could face severe water shortages for years to come.",1

                      Cash App founder Bob Lee knew the suspect in his stabbing death, police say
                  ","
                      San Francisco Police have arrested Nima Momeni in connection to the murder of Cash App founder Bob Lee, San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said during a news conference on Thursday. Scott described Momeni as a 38-year-old man from Emeryville, California. Scott said Momeni and Lee knew one another, but he didn't provide further details about their connection. California Secretary of State Records indicate that Momeni has been the owner of an IT business, which, according to its website, provides services like technical support. Momeni was taken into custody without incident, according to Scott, and taken to the San Francisco County jail where he was booked on one charge of murder. Lee was stabbed to death in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco early in the morning of April 4th. The moments following the stabbing attack were captured on surveillance video and in a 911 call to authorities, according to a local Bay Area news portal. The surveillance footage, reviewed by the online news site The San Francisco Standard, shows Lee walking alone on Main Street, ""gripping his side with one hand and his cellphone in the other, leaving a trail of blood behind him."" Many in the tech world and beyond responded to news of Lee's death with an outpouring of shock and grief. Some, including Elon Musk, also said the incident highlighted the fact that ""violent crime in SF is horrific.""  But on Thursday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins criticized Musk's statement as ""reckless and irresponsible."" Jenkins said Musk's remark ""assumed incorrect circumstances"" about the death and effectively ""spreads misinformation"" while police were actively working to solve the case.  Lee was the former chief technology officer of Square who helped launch Cash App. He later joined MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency and digital payments startup, in 2021 as its chief product officer. Josh Goldbard, the CEO MobileCoin, previously told CNN: ""Bob was a dynamo, a force of nature. Bob was the genuine article. He was made for the world that is being born right now, he was a child of dreams, and whatever he imagined, no matter how crazy, he made real."" Earlier Thursday, San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Matt Dorsey expressed his gratitude to the police department's homicide detail for ""their tireless work to bring Bob Lee's killer to justice and for their arrest of a suspect this morning.""

                      NPR and PBS stop using Twitter after receiving 'government funded media' label
                  ","
                      NPR on Wednesday said that it is suspending its use of Twitter after clashing with the social media company and its owner Elon Musk over a controversial new ""state-affiliated media"" label applied to its accounts. ""NPR's organizational accounts will no longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independent,"" the broadcaster said in a statement. ""We are not putting our journalism on platforms that have demonstrated an interest in undermining our credibility and the public's understanding of our editorial independence."" Late last week, Twitter labeled the radio broadcaster as a ""state-affiliated media"" organization akin to foreign propaganda outlets such as Russia's RT and Sputnik. The move was quickly rebuked by NPR, which is publicly funded by listeners. NPR CEO John Lansing called the label ""unacceptable."" Twitter over the weekend updated the label to ""government-funded media."" In a final series of tweets — its first in over a week — NPR noted other places its work can be found, including through its app and newsletters, as well as on other social media platforms. ""Millions of Americans depend on NPR and their local public radio stations for the fact-based, independent, public service journalism they need to stay informed about the world and about their own communities,"" Lansing said in an email to NPR staff Wednesday. ""It would be a disservice to the serious work you all do here to continue to share it on a platform that is associating the federal charter for public media with an abandoning of editorial independence or standards."" In a series of tweets on Wednesday after NPR's announcement, Musk continued to spar with the outlet and accused it of being ""hypocritical"" in its explanations of how it's funded. US television broadcaster PBS later followed NPR's lead in announcing that it would stop tweeting after its accounts received the same ""government-funded media"" label. ""PBS stopped tweeting from our account when we learned of the change and we have no plans to resume at this time,"" it said in a statement Wednesday.  Earlier in the week, PBS had criticized the label, saying it ""leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government. PBS is primarily funded by the public and philanthropic organizations, with only a small portion of our funding coming from entities affiliated with government."" The moves by NPR and PBS threaten to undermine one of Twitter's key selling points — its role as a central hub for news — especially if other outlets follow in NPR's footsteps. Twitter has also faced backlash over applying a similar ""government funded media"" label to the BBC, which is also primarily funded by the public.  In an interview with the BBC Tuesday, Musk acknowledged the pushback, saying, ""I know the BBC ... was not thrilled about being labeled 'state affiliated media.'"" ""Our goal is simply to ... be as truthful and accurate as possible,"" Musk said, adding that he planned to update the BBC's label to ""publicly funded."" It's just the latest example of Musk antagonizing media outlets. Twitter earlier this month also targeted the New York Times by removing the blue verification checkmark from its main account, after previously pledging to remove checks from all users verified under Twitter's legacy system. And the platform riled some journalists when it briefly restricted users from sharing links to a popular newsletter platform, a move it quickly walked back.  Meanwhile, Twitter also appears to have removed some restrictions on Russian government accounts that had been put in place following the outset of Russia's war in Ukraine. ""All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves,"" Musk said in a tweet commenting on the decision Sunday.  The chaos comes as Musk attempts to shore up Twitter's business, which he has repeatedly said was on the brink of bankruptcy and had just ""four months to live"" following his takeover.  Twitter has faced an exodus of advertisers, who have been concerned about increased hate speech on the platform and massive cuts to the company's workforce. In the meantime, Musk has taken on the uphill battle of encouraging users to pay $8 per month for the platform's subscription service. It's ""not fun at all"" and can sometimes be ""painful,"" the billionaire CEO told the BBC Tuesday of running the company, although he suggested that some Twitter advertisers are returning to the platform. --CNN's Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.

                      Deal close for Washington Commanders football team
                  ","
                      A group that is led by Wall Street billionaire Josh Harris and includes NBA legend Magic Johnson is nearing a deal to buy the NFL's Washington Commanders, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN. If finalized, the sale would mark the end of the controversial ownership of the Washington franchise by embattled billionaire Daniel Snyder. The group also includes Mitchell Rales, the billionaire co-founder of conglomerate Danaher, the source said. The NFL, the Commanders, and Harris's office would not comment on the matter. News of the near deal was first reported by Sportico, which reported the team sold for $6 billion, a record for a North American sports franchise. The current record of $4.65 billion for the purchase of the NFL's Denver Broncos was set just last year. Snyder purchased the team, then named the Washington Redskins for a reported $750 million in 1999. The team dropped its previous name in 2020 in the face of prolonged criticism. It adopted the Commanders name last year, after playing two seasons with the name Washington Football Team. Forbes had previously estimated the value of the Commanders at $5.6 billion, making it the sixth most valuable football team, after the Dallas Cowboys, the New England Patriots, the Los Angeles Rams, the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears. The only franchises from other sports worth more than that $5.6 billion estimated value are the New York Yankees and New York Knicks.  The reported rise in value for the team to $6 billion would represent about a 9% annual return on the original purchase price. Harris, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, already owns the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and co-owns the NHL's New Jersey Devils. The Harris-led group officially placed a bid on the Commanders in late March, CNN previously reported. Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers superstar, joined the group last month. Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos placed a separate $6 billion bid to buy the Commanders last month as well, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Snyder said last year that he is considering a sale of the team. At the time, Snyder and his wife, Tanya, announced that they hired Bank of America Securities ""to consider potential transactions."" The decision to seek a buyer came after DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced a lawsuit against Snyder, the team and the NFL, alleging they colluded to deceive DC residents about an NFL investigation into the team's toxic workplace culture and allegations of sexual assault. The lawsuit alleges those deceptive efforts aimed to keep fans in the dark and increase profits for the team. The lawsuit cites the District of Columbia's Consumer Protection Procedures Act, which gives the Attorney General broad authority to hold individuals or a company accountable for misleading customers. Racine subsequently filed another suit for allegedly cheating ticket holders out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The complaint alleges that Pro Football Inc., the Snyder-led official owner of the Commanders, implemented a ""decades-long unlawful scheme"" to withhold hundreds of thousands of dollars in security deposits fans paid for season tickets and ""converted that money into revenue for the Team, to use for its own purposes."" In June of 2022, the House Oversight Committee also accused Snyder of fostering a ""toxic workplace"" and conducting ""a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL's own internal review."" And an internal investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson in 2021 resulted in the NFL fining the Commanders $10 million and Snyder handing control of the franchise's daily operations to his wife. Snyder has denied the allegations. News of a possible sale was cheered by some of Snyder's accusers Thursday. ""Today marks the end of a long, difficult chapter for all employees and fans of the Washington football organization,"" read a statement from Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, two attorneys representing more than 40 former Washington Commanders employees. ""We are proud of our many clients who made this moment possible -- the brave women and men who came forward repeatedly and at great personal risk to expose the decades of sexual harassment and financial wrongdoing at the team.  Their determination and perseverance forced this sale to happen.""   ""We want to welcome the new owners and hope a new chapter can truly begin at the organization. We expect that the NFL now understands that such an abusive workplace for women is unacceptable,"" the statement continued. ""The NFL must be more vigilant and must ensure that owners are held to the same standards as all employers; sexual harassment is illegal and must not be tolerated."" -- CNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report

                      Fort Lauderdale airport to remain closed until Friday morning after the rainiest day in the city's history causes severe flooding
                  ","
                      Fort Lauderdale experienced the rainiest day in its history Wednesday -- a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event -- sparking a flash flood emergency in Broward County that has prompted emergency rescues, forced drivers to abandon cars, shuttered schools and shut down the airport through 5 a.m. Friday. And more rain is on the way. The region recorded widespread rainfall totals of more than a foot, while Fort Lauderdale tallied 25.91 inches in a 24-hour period, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service office in Miami. Two weak tornadoes also hit Broward County Wednesday, one just west of Hollywood and another south of the Fort Lauderdale airport, according to the Miami National Weather Service. Both were short-lived and rated EF-0, the weakest category.  While the rain Thursday won't reach nearly the amounts that fell on Wednesday, it will be problematic and create additional flooding, the National Weather Service said. Gusty winds, small hail and even isolated tornadoes are possible.  A flood warning for Broward County is in effect until 7:30 p.m., the National Weather Service said, and a severe thunderstorm warning is in effect for parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties. The storms may bring winds of up to 60 mph and potentially small hail.  Thunderstorms are beginning to develop across southeastern Florida and will once again bring a risk of flash flooding to the region. ""Isolated instances of flash flooding are likely this afternoon with locally heavy rainfall capable of 1-3 inch per hour rates,"" according to the Weather Prediction Center. ""This may lead to additional localized rainfall totals of 3-5+ inches, which could possibly aggravate ongoing flooding conditions across the highly sensitive Fort Lauderdale region."" While conditions are similar to Wednesday, favoring heavy rainfall, the prediction center stated that there are significant differences from yesterday that should limit the prolonged occurrence of very heavy rainfall rates. Between 14 and 20 inches of rain have drenched the greater Fort Lauderdale metro area since Wednesday afternoon, according to a Thursday morning update from the National Weather Service office in Miami. The deluge is the ""most severe flooding that I've ever seen,"" one mayor said. ""This amount of rain in a 24-hour period is incredibly rare for South Florida,"" said meteorologist Ana Torres-Vazquez from the weather service's Miami forecast office.  Rainfall of 20 to 25 inches is similar to what the area can receive with a high-end hurricane over more than a day, Torres-Vazquez explained. She described the rainfall as a ""1-in-1,000 year event, or greater,"" meaning it's an event so intense, the chance of it happening in any given year is just 0.1%. During the peak of Wednesday's deluge, a month's worth of rain fell in just one hour. Fort Lauderdale's average rainfall for April is 3 inches and it's been nearly 25 years since the city totaled 20 inches of rain in an entire month. Extreme rainfall is a signature consequence of a warming climate, and it is happening more frequently. The deluge in South Florida is just the latest instance after 1-in-1000 year rains struck over the past year in areas including Dallas, St. Louis, eastern Kentucky and Yellowstone. ""Even though the heavy rain has concluded, numerous roads remain closed,"" the weather service said, adding that flooding is expected to persist.  Earlier, Fort Lauderdale was ""experiencing severe flooding in multiple areas of the city,"" Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue said on social media, warning to stay off the roads as vehicles may become stuck or submerged.   A flash flood emergency -- the highest level of flood warning -- that was in effect for portions of South Florida, including Fort Lauderdale, expired early Thursday.  City crews in Hollywood, Florida, ""are doing everything they can"" to deploy pumps wherever possible and keep drains clear, Mayor Josh Levy told CNN. ""We've recorded over 12 inches of rain since midnight, and that's on top of consecutive days of seemingly nonstop rain,"" Levy said. ""The ground was already saturated so there is extensive flooding all over our city and throughout South Florida. Many roadways are impassable. Lots of vehicles got stuck and left abandoned in the middle of our roadways.   ""I've lived here my whole life. This is the most severe flooding that I've ever seen,"" he said.   Several state agencies and emergency resources are assisting with the flood situation, according to a news release from Gov. Ron DeSantis.  More rain and storms expected Thursday South Florida could get inundated with more even rain as showers and strong storms are in the forecast Thursday. ""After a historic day of rainfall across portions of South Florida that many of us will not soon forget, another potential wet day is ahead for today,"" the weather service in Miami said. There is a slight risk, Level 2 of 5, for severe storms Thursday in parts of Florida, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Jacksonville, according to the Storm Prediction Center. In Fort Lauderdale, airboats and high-clearance buggies have been secured from the county sheriff's office and the Florida Wildlife Commission as officials activated their emergency operations center and will issue a proclamation of a local state of emergency, they said in a statement early Thursday. Emergency crews worked continuously overnight responding to rescue calls across South Florida, Fort Lauderdale city officials said. ""City Hall remains closed. The ground floor is flooded, and staff is working to restore power to the building,"" said a Thursday morning update.   City officials are asking neighbors to be patient as ""flooding conditions remain impactful in the southern areas of the City this morning,"" officials said. ""We expect the flooding to subside through the next hours and have seen improvements in certain areas of downtown."" Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue crews received over 900 calls for service during overnight flooding, according to Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis. The Broward Sheriff's Office assisted the agency in 300 rescue calls received during the historic flooding event, according to the mayor. ""There is not one area of this city that has not been impacted,"" Trantalis said. Officials had asked residents to avoid driving or traveling in Fort Lauderdale amid the storms. ""Public Works staff are clearing drains and operating pumps to mitigate the water as quickly as possible. Efforts have been made to relieve traffic congestion through prioritized signaling to assist individuals leaving the City. We are requesting drivers to stay off the roads and avoid the City of Fort Lauderdale until the water has subsided,"" the city of Fort Lauderdale said in a news release on Wednesday evening. ""Because of the extreme amount of water, most areas will need to drain naturally,"" Trantalis said. ""Crews are out in neighborhoods clearing storm drains to aid water receding from neighborhoods. Vacuum trucks are being deployed strategically throughout the city.""  The Florida Highway Patrol has closed several exits on Interstate 95 in Fort Lauderdale, the city's fire department said. In Coral Gables in Miami-Dade County, officials are working on two water main breaks, according to the Coral Gables Police Department. Some roads in the city are shut down due to the flooding, while others have limited travel, police said, noting residents should give themselves extra time to commute to work. The Broward Sheriff's Office said in a statement Wednesday it is ""being inundated with non-emergency 911 calls regarding the inclement weather"" and asks residents to use 911 only for ""true emergencies,"" also telling residents to avoid driving and to call a tow truck company if a vehicle is stranded and not in an emergency.  Some local services are shuttering Thursday. The Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is closed due to ongoing flooding in the vicinity and will reopen at noon, according to an update from the airport. The airport's departure level reopened to allow people to exit the area, the airport said early Thursday morning.  The Brightline train service has been temporarily suspended between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, the service said on social media.  Additionally, Broward County Public Schools announced the district will be closed Thursday.  ""No city could have planned for this,"" Trantalis said.  Trantalis says he has spoken to the White House and Senator Marco Rubio about the situation. The mayor said Gov. ""DeSantis has not yet called but I'm sure he is very interested in what's going on here.""  Trapped by floodwaters Mandi-Lynn Guertin flew into Fort Lauderdale with her friends for a three-day country music festival that starts Friday. The group flew in from Connecticut and had never experienced weather like this, Guertin told CNN. The car they rented got stuck in about 3 feet of water, died and water quickly filled the inside, so they had to leave it on the side of the road.  ""We currently can't leave our Airbnb because the flood waters are too high and no Ubers will come out to get us,"" Guertin said. Guertin and her friends work in emergency services back home but Wednesday night, the quick nature of the flooding really scared them, she said. ""Southern hospitality and helping your 'neighbors' is truly a thing down here and I could not be more thankful today,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""So many strangers did so much for us tonight."" For now, the group plans to wait it out at their Airbnb, without much of a choice and hope that enough water recedes so they can attend the music festival tomorrow, which has not been canceled yet. Rock The Ocean's Tortuga Music Festival, the oceanside festival, will ""move forward"" as planned, despite flood conditions in the city, according to event organizers. Dawn Grayson lives 20 minutes from Fort Lauderdale -- Hollywood International Airport and also got stuck on her way home Wednesday when torrential rain flooded the airport and surrounding roads.  Grayson was stuck in her car for several hours while she waited for flood waters to subside, she told CNN. ""The parking garages were flooding, and vehicles got stuck,"" Grayson said. ""We were stuck in our vehicle for 5 hours on the terminal road.""

                      The fire at an Indiana plastics recycling plant is close to being extinguished as residents wonder what's now in the air
                  ","
                      After firefighters spent two days battling an inferno fueled by plastics in eastern Indiana, it may be 99% extinguished by Thursday evening or Friday morning, officials said.  But the blaze at a Richmond recycling plant has reignited old frustrations over safety hazards at the facility and sparked new fears among residents about the future of their health. About 2,000 people living within a half-mile radius of the plant are still under evacuation orders Thursday, two days after the fire started. And for the second straight day, Richmond public schools are closed. ""If you are downwind of the area, stay inside, close your windows, and turn off air conditioning,"" Richmond city officials warned. The fire was 90% out as of Thursday afternoon, Richmond Fire Department Chief Tim Brown said at a news conference. Firefighters are now going through the ""hot zone"" in the building and applying foam to extinguish the fire, Brown added. The US Environmental Protection Agency had not detected any toxic compounds as of Wednesday morning and is expected to release updated results Thursday. But the state fire marshal has already said the smoke plumes were ""definitely toxic."" Due to very little wind, ""residents may notice that the smoke from the fire has settled more in and around the city and in areas that had not previously had issues,"" the Wayne County Emergency Management Agency said Thursday morning.  The EPA has been monitoring air quality at 15 locations around the site for the possibility of toxic chemicals from the incinerated plastics.  The billowing black smoke stirred memories of the recent toxic train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio. High levels of some chemicals from that disaster could pose long-term risks, researchers have said. As the black smoke spreads, so do health concerns Corey McConnell's family fled their home in the evacuation zone Tuesday night. He could already smell fumes and saw exhausted firefighters battling the blaze. ""It's really unbelievable,"" McConnell told CNN. ""Makes me worry about the health of my family, not just today but in the future as well. Who knows how long this could be in the air for?"" Resident Wendy Snyder evacuated to a Red Cross emergency shelter but briefly returned home to grab a few belongings, she told CNN affiliate WHIO. That's when she noticed the stench of burning plastic. ""There is a stink in the air when you go outside on our porch,"" Snyder said. ""In fact, it burned my throat because (we) weren't wearing a mask."" The primary health concern to residents is particulate matter -- fine particles found in smoke -- that could cause respiratory problems if inhaled, said Christine Stinson, executive director of the Wayne County Health Department. N95 masks could protect against the particles, but people should leave an area if they see or smell smoke or experience symptoms, Stinson said.  Due to the age of the building, asbestos -- a naturally occurring but very toxic substance once widely used for insulation -- is another possible concern. The EPA was evaluating the area, including school grounds, for potential fire debris that might contain asbestos, it said Wednesday night. And while the EPA's air quality tests had found no signs of toxic chemicals such as styrene or benzene as of mid-Wednesday morning, testing continues as more smoke settles. Such chemicals could increase the risk of cancer if someone is exposed to a high concentration for a prolonged period of time, said Richard Peltier, associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. ""We know that it is very common that a large range of chemicals are formed whenever plastic materials are burned, including styrene, benzene, and a wide number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons -- all of these are strong carcinogens, and it's important for people to avoid exposures,"" Peltier said. Short-term exposure could also cause symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea, coughing, headache and fatigue. ""Asthma is regularly triggered by these types of complicated exposures so if you have asthma, it's really important to be extra careful,"" Peltier said. It's not clear when evacuated residents will be allowed to return home, Richmond officials said. Fire officials expect the smoldering site to burn for several days. City officials blame plant owner for the fire While it's not yet clear what sparked the recycling plant inferno, local leaders have shared concerns since at least 2019 that the facility was riddled with fire hazards and building code violations, records show.  ""We knew it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when this was going to happen,"" the fire chief said. In 2019, the city's Unsafe Building Commission found that the ""cumulative effect of the code violations present"" rendered ""the premises unsafe, substandard, or a danger to the health and safety on the public,"" according to meeting minutes obtained by CNN.  During a commission hearing, the plant's owner, Seth Smith, admitted one of the buildings on the property had no fire extinguishing system, the records show. CNN has reached out to Smith, and the attorney who previously represented him in a related lawsuit declined to comment. Richmond officials ""were aware that what was operating here was a fire hazard,"" Mayor Dave Snow said Wednesday, accusing the plant's owner of ignoring a city order to clean up the property. The fire began in a semitrailer loaded with plastics, then spread to surrounding piles of recyclables before eventually reaching the building, which was ""completely full from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall,"" Brown, fire chief, said. When firefighters arrived, he said, they had difficulty reaching the buildings because access roads were blocked by piles of plastic.  ""Everything that's ensued here -- the fire, the damages, the risk that our first responders have taken and the risk these citizens are under -- are the responsibility of that negligent business owner,"" Snow said.  After Smith was ordered by the city building commission to repair or demolish and vacate his properties in 2019, the plant owner and his company petitioned a court to review the order.  An Indiana circuit court judge ruled in favor of the city in March 2020. The court found in part Smith's properties ""constitute a fire hazard; are a hazard to public health; constitute a nuisance; and are dangerous to people or property because of violations of statute and City Ordinance concerning building condition and maintenance."" The city last year seized two of the three land parcels the recycling plant sits on after Smith failed to pay property taxes.  It's unclear what steps the city took to remedy the site since the seizure and whether it took any steps before 2022 to enforce its orders requiring Smith to repair or demolish and vacate the properties. Smith was contacted by an investigator Tuesday night, the mayor said. While firefighters try to snuff out the blaze, they face another challenge: trying not to destroy potential evidence that might help determine the cause, Brown said.  Officials probably won't be able to identify the cause of the blaze until after the fire is extinguished and investigators can safely enter the plant, the state fire marshal's office said.   Any legal liability against the plant owner will be handled after the cleanup process, City Attorney Andrew J. Sickmann said at a Thursday news conference. ""Whether or not there can be potential criminal liability would be a question for law enforcement and prosecutors,"" Sickmann said. The only operation running out of the building before the fire was moving materials out and shipping them overseas as ordered by officials, Sickmann said. ""It's his mess, it's been shown again and again it's his mess,"" Snow, the mayor, said of the owner. ""Everything that's ensued here remains his responsibility."" Snow added that they are tracking all costs of the incident in case of potential litigation.

                      A man with schizophrenia died after being kept naked and malnourished in solitary confinement at an Indiana jail for nearly 3 weeks, lawsuit says
                  ","
                      An Indiana man with a history of schizophrenia died in the summer of 2021 due to organ failure following nearly three weeks in solitary confinement at a Jackson County jail, according to a newly filed lawsuit.   The lawsuit says jailers placed Joshua McLemore, 29, in a windowless, padded isolation cell, where he remained ""confined, naked, alone, and in a constant state of psychosis for the next 20 days."" The suit, filed on behalf of McLemore's estate, is brought against Jackson County and its sheriff Rick Meyer, three jail employees, a doctor who oversaw clinical issues and procedures for the county and jail, and the company that provides health care services at the facility, Advanced Correctional Healthcare.  McLemore's cause of death was ""multiple organ failure due to refusal to eat or drink with altered mental status due to untreated schizophrenia,"" according to a coroner's report provided by his attorney. A history of methamphetamine withdrawal was also noted as a contributing factor.  McLemore's death was the result of ""multiple acts of indifference, as well as systemic and unconstitutional deficiencies"" in the county's policies, practices and training programs, says the suit filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  Additionally, it says the jail did not sufficiently supervise or train its staff on how to handle serious medical or mental health care issues and accuses Advanced Correctional Healthcare of having insufficient training and inadequate staffing. Advanced Correctional Healthcare told CNN in a statement that it was not allowed to disclose patient information, but that it ""is proud to have a 95% client retention rate. ACH has a reputation for solving problems by doing the right thing the first time. In the last year, at least 52 patient lives have been saved."" CNN has reached out to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office for comment. ""Josh McLemore wasn't a criminal,"" Hank Balson, an attorney representing McLemore's estate, told CNN in a statement. ""He was mentally ill and in crisis. He was out of touch with reality and needed help. This is glaringly obvious to anyone who watches the videos of him in his isolation cell."" According to the lawsuit, McLemore struggled with diagnosed schizophrenia and substance abuse and was in the midst of an ""acute mental health crisis."" He was taken to the emergency room to be evaluated after his apartment manager found him in his apartment, naked, confused, and disoriented.   McLemore was arrested for pulling a nurse's hair while in the emergency room, placed in handcuffs and leg shackles, and carried out of the hospital, naked except for his underwear, according to Balson. He was charged with battery against a public official and criminal mischief damage and taken to the Jackson County Jail on July 20, 2021, according to court documents.  Upon arriving at the jail, McLemore was taken to the padded isolation cell and remained there ""almost continuously"" until his death weeks later, the suit says. He was only taken from the cell four times, it said, mainly when jail employees would strap him to a chair and put him under a shower or clean his cell.  Though food was delivered to McLemore's cell door two or three times a day, he didn't retrieve the food or would dump some or all of it on the floor of his cell, which was littered with urine, feces, and torn food containers, according to the suit. While in the cell, McLemore lost nearly 45 pounds.  Guards kept the bathroom adjoining the cell locked for most of the time he was confined, the suit says. Surveillance video included in the lawsuit shows McLemore naked in a cell that appears to have substances smeared on the walls and floor. ""By the time staff finally sent Josh to the hospital, his condition was so dire that the local hospital did not have the clinical resources to treat him and he had to be airlifted to a larger hospital in Cincinnati, where he died two days later,"" the lawsuit said. A 2022 investigation by the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney found that no crimes were committed by jail employees in relation to McLemore's death, according to CNN affiliate WDRB. The lawsuit brings a claim for the violation of McLemore's 14th Amendment rights, accusing all defendants of ""causing him unnecessary pain and suffering and, ultimately, an avoidable death."" It is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

                      Louisville mass shooting victim had just moved to city two weeks earlier for new bank job
                  ","
                      The daughter of Juliana Farmer, one of the five victims of the mass shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, said Wednesday night her mother had just moved to Louisville two weeks prior for a new job.  ""This monster took away my mother, and I'm hurt because my mother moved here to help me, a single mom with four kids. I only got two weeks with her here in Louisville ... a city she knew nothing about,"" Alia Chambers told CNN. ""I'm heartbroken. I hated him. I hated him but I forgive him because my mama is in a better place."" Farmer moved to Louisville from Henderson, Kentucky, and was thrilled to begin her role with Old National Bank as a loan officer. ""My mom went from working at 19 years old at Kmart to sitting with executives at a bank. I'm gonna fulfill my mama's dream. Either I'm going back to nursing school or I'm gonna ask them, can I take over her position at that bank,"" she said. ""She was so excited about that job. She was happy."" Farmer had three adult children and four grandsons, Chambers said.  The day before she was killed, she found out her son, J'Yeon Chambers, was expecting a baby girl, he told CNN. The baby is due in September, the same month his mother was born. ""And so it's just crazy how she gets taken the day after we reveal that we're having the baby. So my child is going to be her basically all over again,"" her son said. ""She gave us the name that she always wanted a girl to be named and we're going to stick with it."" The new details come as CNN has learned more about the victims and wounded in Monday's workplace mass shooting, including the survival of a woman who was seated between two people who were killed. Old National Bank employee Connor Sturgeon, 25, opened fire with an AR15-style rifle in an office conference room and killed five colleagues before he was fatally shot by a responding officer. Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Tommy Elliott, Deana Eckert and James Tutt were shot and killed, police said.  Of the eight people who were wounded, a 26-year-old police officer remains in critical condition after being shot in the head, requiring brain surgery. Woman who was seated between two victims released from hospital One woman who was shot but survived was seated between Farmer and Elliott when the attack began, according to the father of her children, Rex Minrath. Dana Mitchell, an employee at the bank, has returned home from the hospital and is recovering, Minrath told CNN in a phone interview Thursday. She is expected to have surgery in the coming weeks to remove ""the rest of the bullet,"" he said.  ""Dana was in the conference room between Tommy and Juliana. She sat between those two,"" Minrath told CNN. ""And then when they hit the ground, they were all on the ground together. She is fortunate because both of them weren't so lucky."" Mitchell's son, Ross Minrath, posted a series of images and updates about his mother's condition on his Facebook page this week. ""After positive results from blood work and her being an all around badass, my Mom was released from the hospital today,"" he wrote on Tuesday night. ""She is very sore but doing well. Her phone has been at the bank and hopes to start reaching out herself tomorrow."" In one Facebook post, he said the gunshot bruised her lung and that doctors were able to clean the wound on her back. His mother, he added, ""is the toughest I've ever known."" He thanked those who had reached out to the family with well wishes and asked for people to continue to send prayers for his mother. In addition, the first person who was shot inside the bank survived, a city official told CNN. In the shooter's Instagram livestream of the attack, which has since been taken down, the female bank worker said ""good morning"" before the gunman warned her, ""You need to get out of here,"" according to an official familiar with the video. The woman had her back to the gunman as he struggled to get the safety off and load his AR15-style weapon properly. He then shot her in the back, an official previously told CNN. Governor says he's 'empty' after friend's death At a vigil Wednesday, scores of residents and officials gathered Wednesday evening to mourn publicly the employees gunned down at their workplace by a coworker.  ""It's important that we take time to acknowledge those losses and what they mean for us as people and as a community,"" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said during the vigil at the Muhammad Ali Center Plaza. ""So, that later we can gather our energies and focus on preventing these tragedies.""  Greenberg noted the heartbreaking impacts of gun violence in his city beyond Monday's carnage, which unfolded less than a mile from where the vigil was held Wednesday.  ""There will be a time to act. To take steps in honor of those we've lost and to channel our grief and pain into meaningful action. That day is coming,"" the mayor continued. ""Today is to mourn, to lean on each other and support each other."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at the vigil that Elliott, a senior vice president at the bank, was one of his closest friends. ""I'll admit that while I am not angry, I am empty. And I'm sad. And I just keep thinking that maybe we'll wake up,"" Beshear said, his voice breaking.  ""What I know is, I just wish I'd taken an extra moment, made an extra call, tell him how much I care about him. And I know we are all feeling the same. But I also know they hear us now. And that they feel our love,"" Beshear said. Shooter's mother called 911 minutes after massacre began Louisville Metro Police on Wednesday released a series of 911 calls showing the fear and panic both inside and outside the bank during the shooting early Monday morning. In one emergency call, a woman who identified herself as an employee of a different Old National Bank branch told the dispatcher she saw the massacre happen in real time while she was on a video call with colleagues at the scene. ""How do you know you have an active shooter on site?"" the operator asked. ""I just watched it. I just watched it on a Teams meeting. We were having a board meeting,"" she said. ""I saw somebody on the floor. We heard multiple shots and people started saying 'Oh my God,' and then he came into the board room."" Another 911 call came from the gunman's mother, who said her son was headed to the bank with a gun and expressed her shock and confusion. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh my Lord."" The woman said her son ""apparently left a note"" about the incident. ""We don't even own guns. I don't know where he would have gotten a gun."" Other calls came from a bank employee speaking in a whisper who was hiding in a closet, a man who fled the building and took shelter at a nearby dental office, and another caller who hid under a desk inside the building.

                      Mortgage rates drop for fifth week in a row
                  ","
                      Homebuyers are embracing mortgage rates dipping closer and closer to 6%. Rates fell for the fifth week in a row as inflation continues to ease. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.27% in the week ending April 13, down slightly from 6.28% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 5%. ""Incoming data suggest inflation remains well above the desired level but showing signs of deceleration,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ""These trends, coupled with tight labor markets, are creating increased optimism among prospective homebuyers as the housing market hits its peak in the spring and summer."" The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. Inflation continues to cool The economy continues to give off some mixed signals, but as long as inflation is cooling, it is good for mortgage rates. The average rate dropped lower this week as bond yields bounced back from last week's lows following economic data including last Friday's jobs report that signaled a moderating, but still relatively strong job market, said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com chief economist. This week's inflation data, based on the March Consumer Price Index, left plenty of room for interpretation, she said.  ""On the one hand, the fact that inflation is still running at more than twice the target level, and core inflation — which includes goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy — saw an uptick to 5.6% in March, highlights that the Fed still has more to do and may need to lift short-term rates again at its early May meeting,"" said Hale.  ""On the other hand, overall inflation slowed more notably, and even core inflation on a month-to-month basis eased somewhat, a sign that the Fed's tightening is having the desired effect,"" she added. ""Even if the Fed needs to raise short-term rates a bit higher, we are very likely nearing the end of the tightening cycle.""  The Fed does not set the interest rates that borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed's actions, what the Fed actually does and investors' reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. ""As long as the economy continues to see progress on inflation, that should help keep mortgage rates at the lower end of the 6% to 7% range that we've seen over the past few months,"" Hale said. ""However, any surprises in the data will likely lead to some volatility in that range.""  Homebuyers are taking advantage of lower rates Even before the recent easing in mortgage rates, buyers and sellers registered some improvement in sentiment toward housing with higher levels of pending sales. Recent drops in rates have brought in some buyers, and mortgage applications were up last week from the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""Prospective homebuyers responded to lower rates last week, leading to an 8% jump in applications to buy a home,"" said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. ""The likelihood of even lower rates in the months ahead should lead to increased demand, despite recent signs of a slowing economy and tighter financial conditions.""  As long as the current dip in mortgage rates can be sustained, buyers will be on the hunt. That may pull more homeowners into the market as sellers, said Hale.  ""Despite the huge shifts in market momentum, home sellers can count on the usual seasonal trends tipping the scales a bit further in their favor while home shoppers should expect a fair amount of competition that should ease as we move later into the year,"" she said.

                      Elizabeth Holmes must report to prison this month while waiting out her appeal, judge rules
                  ","
                      A judge on Monday denied Elizabeth Holmes' request to remain free while she appeals her conviction, setting the stage for the disgraced Theranos founder to report to prison later this month.  In his order, Judge Edward Davila of the Northern District of California said Holmes does not pose a danger to the community or a flight risk, but he cast doubt on her appeal. Even if Holmes won her appeal, he said, it is unlikely to result in a reversal, or an order for a new trial, for all of the counts on which she was found guilty. Davila previously ordered Holmes to turn herself into custody on April 27, 2023. Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison last November, after she was convicted months earlier on multiple charges of defrauding investors while running the failed blood testing startup Theranos. Attorneys for Holmes did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the ruling. Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, Holmes' ex-boyfriend and the former chief operating officer at Theranos, was also found guilty on multiple counts of fraud in a separate trial. He was sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison last December. Balwani's request to remain out of prison during his appeal was also denied, and he has been ordered by Davila to surrender to prison on April 20.  Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos attracted top investors and retail partners with claims that it had developed technology to test for a wide range of conditions using just a few drops of blood. The company began to unravel after a Wall Street Journal investigation in 2015 reported that Theranos had only ever performed roughly a dozen of the hundreds of tests it offered using its proprietary technology, and with questionable accuracy. Holmes' trial was initially delayed multiple times, due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and then because of her pregnancy. Following her sentencing in November, Holmes sought to delay the start of her prison term after giving birth to her second child.  While Davila denied Holmes represented a flight risk, he also addressed the fact that she had previously booked a one-way ticket to Mexico in January 2022. ""Booking international travel plans for a criminal defendant in anticipation of a complete defense victory is a bold move, and the failure to promptly cancel those plans after a guilty verdict is a perilously careless oversight,"" Davila wrote in the court filing.  Holmes' attorneys had previously claimed that Holmes had hoped the verdict would be different when booking the travel plans and that she wanted to make this trip to attend the wedding of friends in Mexico. Davila wrote in court documents that the court accepts Holmes' ""representation that the oneway flight ticket—while ill-advised—was not an attempt to flee the country.""

                      Tupperware: How a plastic bowl with a 'burp seal' gave women a means to an income
                  ","
                      Tupperware, an iconic brand that's woven into the fabric of post World War II America, signaled this week that it could be on its last gasp.  Known the world over for its plastic food storage containers and its sales parties, Florida-based Tupperware warned that the company was running out of cash and needed additional money -- soon -- to say in operation. In some ways, the 77-year-old brand is still a titan: It's, literally, a household name, and its vivid juice- and fruit-colored products are for sale in nearly 70 countries. It pulled in annual sales of $1.3 billion in 2021. But that's down 18.7% from a year ago.  Last October, in a massive shift in its business model, Tupperware rolled out its containers in brighter hues of red, purple and green onto Target shelves nationwide.  But it may be too little, too late.  Experts say this is what happens when a once-pioneering brand, beloved by families through generations, is unable to adapt to an evolving marketplace, brutal competition and attitudes and needs of younger consumers. ""Tupperware was a disruptor in the market and in households nationwide when its plastic storage containers launched in 1946,"" said Ventakesh Shankar, professor of marketing and ecommerce at Texas A&M University's Mays Business School.  ""The company also had tremendous cultural impact. The famous neighborhood house parties where Tupperware products were sold by the host to her family and friends was a new way of marketing, combining socializing with direct sales."" But while the company reaped the benefits of its innovative approach for years, it ultimately couldn't keep pace with changing times. History has shown, said Shankar, that nostalgia usually isn't enough to sustain legacy brands. Whether or not Tupperware survives as a business, its rich history will likely endure, said William Keep, professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey School of Business. ""I've been married for 50 years and we still have and use our Tupperware from when we married. Tupperware was something people gave as gifts at weddings and baby showers,"" said Keep. ""Clearly its a brand that focused on two things, quality and for much of its history, women.""   Battling food waste Tupperware is named after Earl Tupper, a chemist in the 1940s who created lightweight, non-breakable plastic containers inspired by the seal-tight design of paint cans. The purpose was to help families save money on costly food waste in the post-war era.  The most significant aspect of the invention was a first-of-its-kind ""burping seal."" The older models of Tupperware containers would make a burp-like sound when air was let out from under the lid before it was firmly pressed and closed for an air-tight lock. But Tupperware products didn't sell well in stores when they launched, according to the company, because consumers weren't sure how to use the (back then) white and off-white containers.  That conundrum led to an idea to demonstrate the product, which then evolved into the famous Tupperware house parties.  The practice dove-tailed brilliantly with the rise of post-war suburbia: women had bigger homes, bigger kitchens, more money to spend, more children to feed and more responsibilities to keep house. Into that climate came Tupperware. Its first milky-white plastic product, the ""Wonder Bowl,"" cost 39 cents, according to Smithsonian Magazine; the museum has a huge Tupperware collection. Over the years, tangerine orange, baby blue and pink and kiwi green products followed. Tupperware stereotyped women as much as it empowered them Tupperware parties became popular social and marketing events in the 1950s and 60s.  The parties were much more than just a show-and-tell, said Bob Kealing, a Tupperware scholar and author of two books on the brand.  These were glamorous affairs, akin to an afternoon tea party, where women dressed up because the parties were a feminized, soft-sell approach to selling plastic products. ""Women wore beautiful dresses, heels, gloves. They wanted to present an upscale version of themselves because these were also events where women were recruited into the Tupperware sales force,"" he said. The parties gained traction also because they were one of the few socially acceptable ways for women to make money at the time. Tupperware products were the centerpiece of the event, carefully stacked and presented to be shown off. ""The parties were designed to be fun social gatherings,"" including games and prizes, he said, and the most successful Tupperware saleswomen were sometimes rewarded with diamond rings. The rise of suburbia While Tupperware wasn't the first to pioneer the direct sales model, it did scale it up in size and opportunity for women, said Tracey Deutsch, associate professor, department of history  of history at University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts. Tupperware's success, said Deutsch also coincided with the expansion of suburbs across the country. ""Not only did women need the space to hold the Tupperware parties but also space in the kitchen to store these containers,"" she said. ""And it was also dependent on a certain level of household well-being. You needed to have enough food to require these storage containers."" Brownie Wise was perhaps the most famous Tupperware hostess of them all. Wise, a divorced single mother living in Florida, held her own Tupperware parties in the 1940s and 50s and became a budding entrepreneur. Tupper himself took notice.  He eventually hired Wise as his vice president of marketing, an unprecedented role for women back then. A famous Tupperware lady Kealing, author of """"Life of the Party: The Remarkable Story of How Brownie Wise Built, and Lost, a Tupperware Part Empire,""  said Wise became the face of the brand and was very good at it.  ""It was great marketing and the media ate it up,"" he said. But she was ultimately fired by Tupper in 1957. ""Tupper... saw how the brand was becoming more about her,"" said Kealing. Traditionally, parties were the only way you could buy Tupperware. Over time, the parties became ubiquitous both in suburban and city dwellings.  As the company grew, its fleet of hostesses ballooned into a global direct sales force of nearly 3 million in 2019. More recently, the brand was on a quest to grab the attention of Millennials and Gen Zers and become as relevant in their everyday lives as it was for their grandmas and moms. Shelving the Mad Men era That meant shedding the throwback to its ""Mad Men"" era image, and positioning Tupperware products as buzz-worthy, higher quality and more durable than rivals, high-utility and with an environmentally-friendly purpose.  Tupperware had to go beyond parties or sales on its own website and the brief and limited pilot programs it had tried with retailers HomeGoods, Bed Bath and Beyond, plus an earlier pilot attempt at Target itself. The shift in strategy came too late. ""We've seen this happen with Toys 'R' Us, Twinkie, most recently Bed Bath & Beyond,"" said Shankar.  Tupperware, he said, is facing a perfect storm of stiff competition from other brands -- Rubbermaid, Glad, Pyrex, Oxo and Ziploc -- selling similar products or even disposable versions for less, lack of interest from younger shoppers and lack of exciting new products and strategies to sell them. ""Millennials, and Gen Zers especially probably aren't aware of its iconic status and really don't have a reason to give it another chance,"" said Shankar. What went wrong? ""In my mind, the company made two critical errors,"" said Keep, professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey School of Business. ""With product, it lost ground to competitors"", said Keep. ""Tupperware also consciously didn't walk away from direct selling even as these multilevel marketing strategies stagnated in the 80s and 90s. When it was clear that model was no longer working, the company should have given up on direct sales and sold through retailers."" Bankruptcy could be a path forward for Tupperware, said JohnTalbott, Director at the Center for Education and Research in Retail at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business. ""The most valuable thing Tupperware owns is its brand. Like Blockbuster, the Tupperware brand will never go away,"" he said. ""I suspect it could file for bankruptcy and if there is a buyer for it, Target would be a great option to revive the brand with new designs and a new marketing plan.""

                      Amazon is 'investing heavily' in the technology behind ChatGPT
                  ","
                      Amazon wants investors to know it won't be left behind in the latest Big Tech arms race over artificial intelligence. In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company is ""investing heavily"" in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, the same technology that underpins ChatGPT and other similar AI chatbots. ""We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences,"" Jassy wrote in his letter to shareholders.  The remarks, which were part of Jassy's second annual letter to shareholder since taking over as CEO, hint at the pressure that many tech companies feel to explain how they can tap into the rapidly evolving marketplace for AI products. Since ChatGPT was released to the public in late November, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all talked up their growing focus on generative AI technology, which can create compelling essays, stories and visuals in response to user prompts. Amazon's goal, according to Jassy, is to offer less costly machine learning chips so that ""small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production."" Large language models are trained on vast troves of data in order to generate responses to user prompts.   ""Most companies want to use these large language models, but the really good ones take billions of dollars to train and many years, most companies don't want to go through that,"" Jassy said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday morning. ""What they want to do is they want to work off of a foundational model that's big and great already, and then have the ability to customize it for their own purposes,"" Jassy told CNBC.  With that in mind, Amazon on Thursday unveiled a new service called Bedrock. It essentially makes foundation models (large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data) from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI and Amazon accessible to clients via an API, Amazon said in a blog post.  Jassy told CNBC he thinks Bedrock ""will change the game for people.""  In his letter to shareholders, Jassy also touted AWS's CodeWhisperer, another AI-powered tool which he said ""revolutionizes developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time.""  ""I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I'll leave that for a future letter,"" Jassy wrote. ""Let's just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.""  In the letter, Jassy also reflected on leading Amazon through ""one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,"" as the e-commerce giant cut some 27,000 jobs as part of a major bid to rein in costs in recent months.  ""There were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year,"" Jassy said in the letter, before outlining steps Amazon took to rethink certain free shipping options, abandon some of its physical store concepts and significantly reduce overall headcount. Amazon disclosed in a securities filing Thursday that Jassy's pay package last year was valued at some $1.3 million, and that the CEO did not receive any new stock awards in 2022. (When Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, he was awarded a pay package mostly comprised of stock awards that valued his total compensation package at some $212 million.) Despite the challenges at Amazon, however, Jassy said in his letter that he finds himself ""optimistic and energized by what lies ahead."" Jassy added: ""I strongly believe that our best days are in front of us.""

                      Father of Madeline Kingsbury's children denies involvement in missing Minnesota mother's disappearance
                  ","
                      The father of a missing Minnesota mother's children said he is cooperating with law enforcement ""at every turn,"" nearly two weeks after the disappearance of 26-year-old Madeline Kingsbury.  Adam Fravel denied any involvement in Kingsbury's disappearance in a statement Wednesday. ""Over the course of the last 12 days my family and I have been subject to a myriad of accusations regarding the disappearance of the mother of my children, Maddi Kingsbury. During these last 12 days I have cooperated with law enforcement at every turn, including sitting down for multiple interviews with Winona County law enforcement.  ""I did not have anything to do with Maddi's disappearance. I want the mother of my 5-year-old and 2-year-old to be found and brought home safely. I want that more than anything,"" said Fravel.  Fravel said he had been advised by law enforcement on April 2 not to attend news conferences or assist in searches for Kingsbury due to safety concerns. ""My non-attendance and silence has been inferred by many as a sign of apathy, or worse. That could not be further from the truth. I want Maddi home and for her to be able to be with our two children,"" said Fravel. Kingsbury was last seen on the morning of March 31.  She did not show up at work as expected the day she disappeared, and did not answer calls from family and friends, police said. She didn't pick up her children from day care that afternoon or make other arrangements. Evidence suggests Kingsbury's disappearance was ""involuntary and suspicious,"" the Winona Police Department said in a Wednesday update. ""We remain extremely concerned for her safety,"" police said in their update.  ""We have drafted and served numerous search warrants as part of our search efforts."" The update didn't address whether Fravel has been cooperating with authorities. Kingsbury's family said in a statement Wednesday they have been working with investigators in the search for her. ""Members of our family and close friends coordinate closely with law enforcement and send out search teams day after day, every day,"" the statement said. ""We will find Madeline. This is our mission and we will not falter."" Police have said they believe her vehicle, a 2014 dark blue Chrysler Town and Country, may have traveled from Winona to eastern Fillmore County on the day of her disappearance.  They have asked residents in that area to check their ""video cameras, doorbell cameras, game cameras ... for any signs of the van passing through or stopping."" Winona is in southeastern Minnesota, near the Wisconsin border.

                      What is El Niño?
                  ","
                      El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world.   Warm water normally is confined to the western Pacific by winds that blow from east to west, pushing it toward Indonesia and Australia. But during an El Niño, the winds slow down and can even reverse direction, allowing the warmer water to spread eastward all the way to South America.  Scientists are still searching for an answer as to why this happens, but the slowing of these winds can last for weeks or months. El Niños -- among many large-scale weather patterns that act in tandem to influence global weather -- occur every two to seven years in varying intensity, and the waters of the eastern Pacific can be up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) warmer than usual. El Niño, which in Spanish means ""little boy,"" is the opposite of the La Niña, or ""little girl,"" climate pattern. El Niño offers a global study in opposites  A strong El Niño heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe. It can especially affect the jet stream -- a narrow band of strong wind in the upper atmosphere -- over the Pacific, which gets stronger and dumps more frequent and intense storms over the western US, especially California, and along South America's west coast. The atmosphere, however, is something of a zero-sum game: More rain in North and South America falls at the expense of normally rainy southern Asia and Australia, which in turn can experience droughts. El Niño has been known to cause intense flooding across eastern sections of Africa -- leading to landslides, an increase in waterborne diseases and even food shortages -- while northern and southern parts of the continent experience severe drought.  A strong El Niño also influences cyclone seasons around the planet. The warmer the Pacific is, the more hurricanes or typhoons it gets -- while fewer hurricanes form in Atlantic Ocean because increased upper-level winds prevent them from developing. This happened during the 2015 hurricane season, with the Pacific breaking records while the Atlantic seeing a relatively quiet year.  It can affect US rainfall -- and Pacific fish Like snowflakes, no two El Niños are exactly alike. For instance, an area of warmer water in the northern Pacific that became known as ""the blob"" during the 2014-2016 El Niño event wasn't there during the 1997 El Niño.  But during typical El Niño years, more rain falls in the southwestern and southeastern United States, while the North experiences much drier and warmer weather. And weather isn't the only thing El Niño affects. Warmer surface waters in the eastern Pacific drive away cold-water fish that are the backbone of the fishing industry in much of Latin America. In fact, fishermen there first noticed the phenomenon and named it ""little boy"" or ""Christ child"" in Spanish, since it often appeared around Christmas. Its climate crisis impact is under review The influence of the climate crisis on El Niño is still a matter of debate.  Climate change could make El Niños' impact worse, some recent studies show. And while the overall number of El Niños is unlikely to increase as the planet warms, amplified, so-called ""super"" El Niños will be twice as likely, other research suggests. Among the most likely byproducts of global warming are more extreme precipitation events because warmer temperatures can hold more water vapor in the atmosphere. That could make El Niño-induced floods even more devastating.

                      January 12, 2023 Russia-Ukraine news
                  ","
                      Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. A British visa plan to attract investment was used by 10 Russian oligarchs placed under sanctions to get residency, according to a review from the UK Home Office on Thursday.  Home Secretary Suella Braverman said a small minority who had used the visa route ""were potentially at high risk of having obtained wealth through corruption or other illicit financial activity, and /or being engaged in serious and organized crime."" Braverman said the 10 Russian oligarchs who used the visa scheme were sanctioned after the invasion of Ukraine. The secretary made the disclosure in a statement Thursday at the end of a long-awaited review into the so-called “golden visa” scheme for high-net-worth individuals. She also said that ""the UK's openness to global business carries risks that malign actors will take advantage of our systems to pursue corrupt and criminal ends. We must ensure that kleptocracies such as Russia are not able to act with impunity overseas."" Braverman said that since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, the UK has placed sanctions on 1,200 individuals and 120 entities linked to the Russian state and frozen $22 billion in Russian assets. Some background: The Tier 1 Investor visa route, often referred to as ""the golden visa,"" was introduced in 2008 to encourage wealthy people outside the European Union to invest in the UK. It was shut down last year. A review of the visa scheme was commissioned in 2018 by the then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd following the Salisbury poisonings. The nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skirpal and his daughter resulted in the death of a woman. In response to the review, Braverman said that ""the Government is clear that any future visa route to facilitate investment-based migration must not offer entry solely on the basis of the applicant's personal wealth."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his daily address thanked the Ukrainian soldiers defending the eastern town of Soledar from a Russian assault. “Especially today I would like to highlight the paratroopers of the 77th separate airmobile brigade, who along with the fighters of the 46th separate airmobile brigade in Soledar hold their positions and inflict significant losses on the enemy,” Zelensky said. “I thank you, guys!” The Ukrainian military unit stationed in Soledar said Thursday that the situation in the contested eastern town is “critical."" “The situation is critical. News coming soon,” the 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Telegram. Fighting is still raging in Soledar, a salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, despite Russian claims that it has gained control of the region. The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especially the Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer. CNN's Rob Picheta, Tim Lister and Olga Voitovych contributed to this post.  Russia’s appointment of a new head of the invasion operation of Ukraine likely reflects ""systemic challenges"" for Russia, according to a US Defense Department spokesperson  The announcement of General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, as overall commander of the campaign shows “some of the systemic challenges that the Russian military has faced since the beginning of this invasion,” Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a press briefing. “We’ve talked about some of those things in terms of its logistics problems, command and control problems, sustainment problems, morale and the largely, large failure to obtain the strategic objectives that they’ve set for themselves,” Ryder said. Ryder said the department will “continue to monitor” such Russian personnel shifts. “I think that the world would rather see Russia focus on withdrawing from Ukraine and saving innocent lives versus spending time on numerous management reshuffles, and Russian soldiers and their families would probably like to see that too,” Ryder said. Wagner, the Russian private military company, posted a video on Telegram Thursday directly disparaging the Russian Defense Ministry’s claim that regular Russian military forces have participated in the assault on Soledar.  A day after Russia’s Defense Ministry reshuffled the command of its so-called ""special military operation,"" Wagner’s post doubles down on the assertion by boss Yevgeny Prigozhin that his forces alone are responsible for the Soledar operation. The video shows two men, faces obscured, wearing fatigues and standing in what looks to be an underground bunker, illuminated by flashlight. “We are officers of the Airborne Forces, we declare that the Airborne Forces did not take part in the assault on the city of Soledar,” one man says. “The assault on the city of Soledar was carried out only by the forces of PMC Wagner. We were not even sent in that direction.” Some context: CNN is unable to verify the men’s identity or the veracity of their statement, but the fact that Wagner posted it at all is significant. Which Russian forces are responsible for the assault in eastern Ukraine has become a key point of contention in the machinations of Russia’s power structure. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that regular Russian forces were operating in and around Soledar, without mentioning Wagner. Prigozhin, in a statement published on a Wagner Telegram channel Monday, called any claim that non-Wagner forces participated in the Soledar assault “fake information.” In a visit to his forces near Bakhmut over New Year’s Eve, Prigozhin directly castigated Kremlin bureaucrats. “Once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world,"" Prigozhin told his fighters in a video posted to Telegram. Some pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers have speculated that the Russian Defense Ministry’s announcement of Valery Gerasimov as its new commander was motivated in part by Wagner’s success. On the ground in Soledar: The Ukrainian military insisted Thursday that the town is still contested, and that its forces were even “conducting counterattacks” in the settlement. A video posted to Telegram Thursday evening shows forces from Wagner in the town. The video has been geolocated by CNN to the northern edge of the town, towards Russian-controlled territory. ""The situation in Soledar is still not easy,” a Wagner fighter says in the video. ""The enemy does not reveal themselves because of the artillery fire, but it's obvious that we've decimated them.” CNN's Josh Pennington contributed reporting to this post.  A Ukrainian soldier in the contested eastern town of Soledar described a dire situation to CNN on Thursday evening, saying “we are just abandoned.” CNN is not identifying the soldier for security reasons. “We tried to withdraw ourselves, but the Orcs [Russians] are already there. If there is no order to withdraw today, we will most likely not have time to leave,” he told CNN over the phone. “We were told that we would be withdrawn. And now we аre just abandoned.” He said that the soldiers had run out of food, were running low on water, and that they had wounded soldiers. He said that they still had some ammunition. “The last evacuation was three days ago,” he said. “The order was to hold out to the very end. Judging by the sounds of the battle, our neighbors [other units] either withdrew or were ordered to withdraw. We were told to hold out.” “We hold on as long as we can. But anyone can get tired and hit the limit eventually. It is impossible to hold on just on a high morale for so long.” Wagner, the Russian private military company, has claimed to have captured all of Soledar. A video posted to Telegram Thursday and geolocated by CNN shows Wagner forces on the northern edge of the town. Ukraine’s 46th Airmobile Brigade claimed Thursday that it was “conducting counterattacks” in the town. “After several days of pulling back, we've even made a small advance,” the unit said on Telegram. “The railway station is ours. The mine is ours. We are waiting for support. Soledar is Ukraine.” A Ukrainian official said Thursday that Russia is stepping up its “illegal integration” of occupied territory into Russia. “They began to replace driver's licenses with Russian ones and issue Russian license plates with a numeric indication of the Russian region,” Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. “The occupiers announced that it will be prohibited to operate vehicles, including personal ones, without meeting these conditions, and in case of violation they can be seized.” Maliar also claimed that Russian forces were forcibly evicting locals from homes in order to house military forces. Spain will receive 225 Ukrainian troops late on Thursday at an air force base near Madrid, including 20 who will get training on HAWK air defense systems to counter air attacks, Spain's Defense Ministry said in a statement. Spain is sending six of the HAWK air defense units to Ukraine.  Most of the remaining troops, who are Ukrainian civilians without prior military experience, will get basic training, the defense ministry said. That will include training on treating people wounded in combat and on procedures against IEDs. The training in Toledo, an hour south of Madrid, is a program designed to handle 400 Ukrainian troops rotating through every two months and is part of the European Union's military assistance mission for Ukraine, the ministry said. It is the second group of Ukrainian troops to come to Spain for training after 64 troops came in November and December, the statement added. Spain's Defense Minister will receive the 225 Ukrainian troops at Torrejón Air Base, according to the ministry.  Other allies' actions: Polish President Andrzej Duda announced a plan to send Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Lviv on Wednesday.  And Ukrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the United States as soon as next week, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday. The Ukrainian military said Thursday that it was conducting counterattacks in Soledar, the eastern town that has been the subject of intense Russian bombardment. “After several days of pulling back, we've even made a small advance,” Ukraine's 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Telegram. “The railway station is ours. The mine is ours. We are waiting for support. Soledar is Ukraine.” Russia is trying to surround nearby Bakhmut using both Wagner private contractors and regular military personnel, Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, said on Telegram. “Our soldiers bravely hold their positions and inflict numerous losses on the enemy,” she said. Why Soledar is important to Russia: The town of Soledar, located in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, has been a target for Russian forces since last May. With a pre-war population of about 10,000, it has little strategic value in itself, but is a waypoint in the Russians’ attritional slog westward. Moscow has struggled for months to attack Bakhmut from the east. Were it to capture Soledar, Russian forces would at least be able to approach the city from a different path. As Ukrainian officials say ""fierce battles"" continue to rage in Soledar, a key town in eastern Ukraine, satellite images show just how much destruction has been inflicted on the area since summer.   Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempt to take Soledar, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Mailar. On Tuesday, the Wagner mercenary group claimed it had taken complete control of the town, but Ukraine refutes that claim. Russian forces have fought hard to take Soledar, but more battles remain, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. Over 500 civilians remain in Soledar, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration. Here's a look at before-and-after satellite images of the town: Why Russia wants to capture Soledar: The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and they've had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive. The Institute for the Study of War says control of Soledar “will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,” the larger prize. A top pro-Kremlin military blogger suggested Thursday that the appointment of a new commander for Russia’s so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine was a canny move designed to “stop blurring responsibility” for the war effort, and prevent the Russian General Staff from blaming “the generals in the field.”  Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias WarGonzo, was personally awarded by President Vladimir Putin with the “Order of Courage” on Dec. 20. The appointment of Valery Gerasimov as commander of the war effort means that Russia’s General Staff will no longer be able to say “it was the generals in the field who failed,” Pegov opined on his Telegram channel. “It is an obvious step to stop blurring responsibility for certain episodes related to the Special Military Operation.” The fact that Gerasimov is chief of the General Staff of the Army means that “the General Staff is now one of those ‘generals in the field,’” Pegov said. “The situation in which this or that local victory has a thousand fathers, and a defeat has the one who is blamed for it, no longer works. The General Staff is now directly and uncompromisingly responsible for absolutely everything,"" he added.  Pegov also said that he did not believe that Sergei Surovikin’s move from commander to deputy commander represented a demotion, but rather a move to better insulate him from politics. “Strictly speaking he was subordinated to Gerasimov anyway and had to agree his every move with the General Staff. Now ‘General Armageddon’ [Surovikin] is still in the center of decision-making, but in a much less vulnerable staff position. His authority in the troops is still at a high level, and the commanders and soldiers in the trenches still believe in him and trust him, and are ready to follow him further,"" he said.  More on Russia's former commander in Ukraine: Surovikin, who had been appointed to the role on Oct. 8, 2022, and was in charge of Russian forces during their retreat from large swaths of Ukraine’s Kherson region. An American Navy veteran who has been detained in Russia for nearly a year was released from Russian custody on Thursday, his family's spokesperson told CNN, after months of negotiations spearheaded by former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.  Taylor Dudley, 35, of Lansing, Michigan, was detained by Russian border patrol police in April 2022 after crossing from Poland into Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. He was in Poland attending a music festival, and it is not clear why he crossed the border.   Dudley's detention — which the US government had not deemed as ""wrongful,"" or based on arbitrary and discriminatory motivations — had not been widely publicized before Thursday because his family wanted the negotiations for his release to remain private.  The Richardson Center for Global Engagement, a nonprofit founded by Richardson, spearheaded the negotiations, family spokesperson Jonathan Franks told CNN. The former governor and diplomat has long worked to free Americans detained abroad, and his center played a role in securing the release of Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former Marine who had been wrongfully detained in Russia, last summer.  The Steve Menzies Global Foundation and the US Embassy also helped to secure Dudley's release, the spokesperson said.  ""Earlier today, Russian authorities released American Citizen Taylor Dudley, a 35-year-old Navy veteran, across the Polish border to Gov. Bill Richardson, his team, and a representative from the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, a release the Richardson Center worked on diligently and quietly for more than 6 months with significant assistance from the Steve Menzies Global Foundation, from Hostage U.S., and from the James Foley Foundation. The family will be forever grateful for the work of all three.” ""The past 9 months have been difficult ones for the family and they ask the media to respect their privacy and give them the space to welcome Taylor home,"" he added. In a separate statement to CNN, Richardson said Dudley had been released at the Russia-Poland Bagrationovsk-Bezledy border crossing on Thursday, after nearly a year of negotiations. He also acknowledged the involvement of the State Department and the US Embassies in Moscow and Warsaw in helping to secure Dudley’s release.  “After six months of intensive work, it's great to see this release of Taylor Dudley happen,” Richardson told CNN by phone on Thursday. “We worked it hard in Moscow and Kaliningrad and first raised it during our meetings with Russian officials on Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed.”  Several US citizens remain detained in Russia, including former US Marine Paul Whelan, who is designated as wrongfully detained. He was arrested in Russia in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison. In 2022, the US proposed trading Whelan and American basketball star Brittney Griner in a prisoner swap for arms dealer Viktor Bout, but Russia only agreed to release Griner. CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. A day after Poland’s president expressed his intention to send German-manufactured battle tanks to Ukraine, Germany’s vice chancellor has suggested that his country will not block the weapons transfer. “Germany should not stand in the way of other countries taking decisions to support Ukraine, independent of which decisions Germany takes,” Robert Habeck said on the sidelines of a Greens Party meeting in Berlin. It would be the first time a Western-made tank has been sent to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. Because the Leopard tank is German-manufactured, its re-export would typically need the approval of the German government. Steffen Hebestreit, spokesperson for the German federal government, said Wednesday that he was “not aware of any specific inquiries” from foreign governments about re-exporting Leopard tanks. Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday cautioned during a news conference in Lviv, Ukraine, that “a whole range of formal requirements, approvals and so on must also be met.” The German government has also come under pressure from Ukrainian officials to itself export battle tanks to Ukraine. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht on Thursday did not rule out that possibility. “In the times in which we live – in which we are facing many great challenges in the face of a war in Europe – we are well-advised to always adapt to the respective situation,” Lambrecht said. “There is no decision in the federal government to hand over battle tanks."" Nonetheless, she said that they would “not rule anything out” and that Germany would make decisions “together with its allies.” Other allies' actions: The British government is working with partners to discuss how to go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine, including the provision of tanks, according to the prime minister's spokesperson on Wednesday. And Ukrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the United States as soon as next week, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday. A top Ukrainian military official said Thursday that Russia’s appointment of a new military commander shows that its war in Ukraine is not going to plan. “Since the first days of the war, we have been observing the periodic changes in the leadership of the armed forces of the occupying country,” Oleksii Hromov, deputy chief of the General Staff’s main operational directorate, said during a press briefing. “If everything was in order, the personnel changes would not take place with such frequency.” “The latest personnel changes, first of all, indicate that there is a need to combine the management system and the command and control system of the troops in their ranks. Not everything works out the way they want. How it will be further — we will see.” More on the appointment:  Russia’s Defense Ministry announced Wednesday that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, would become the overall commander of the campaign, with the current commander, Sergey Surovikin, becoming one of his three deputies.Surovikin was only appointed as the overall commander of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls the “Special Military Operation” in October. CNN's Tim Lister contributed reporting to this post.  Oleksii Hromov, the deputy chief of Ukraine's General Staff’s main operational directorate, declined to discuss percentages when referring to Ukrainian control of the eastern town of Soledar. Hromov said “regarding Soledar. There are fierce battles. It is inappropriate to estimate in percentage terms what part of the city we control, what part of the city the enemy is trying to control. Battles are going on, fierce battles.” During recent days, there has been conflicting language about who controls the Donetsk town as battles over the area continue to unfold.  The comments from Hromov may hint at the difficult situation facing Ukrainian forces in the city, especially as Wagner forces say they control the center of the city and the Russian Armed Forces have blockaded the southern and northern routes of the town.  On Wednesday, a soldier fighting in Soledar told CNN “during these days everything will be determined for the city. Because we are being trapped, they want to encircle us,” suggesting a shrinking of territory in Ukrainian control. The importance of Soledar: The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and have had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says control of Soledar “will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,” the larger prize. CNN's Rob Picheta and Tim Lister contributed reporting to this post.  The Kremlin said Thursday it ""does not have information"" on the two UK nationals reportedly missing in Donbas in eastern Ukraine. “We know from media reports that we are talking about British citizens who were militants, took part in the hostilities with weapons in their hands. It appears that documents were found on the battlefield,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a routine conference call with reporters. The families of both men, Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Parry, say the two had gone to Ukraine to work as humanitarian volunteers. CNN has seen no evidence they participated in hostilities in Ukraine.  Peskov also said he is not aware if the British side sought help from Moscow but added “If there is a request for assistance [in finding the bodies and getting them to the UK], of course, it will be considered.”  On Thursday a Downing St spokesperson said ""the reports we have had today are deeply concerning. They have been reported by the Wagner Group as the source of that, so I would urge caution in reporting that until any such claims are verified.” Key developments in the case: On Wednesday, Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin posted a claim on his Telegram feed that his private military company Wagner found a body of one of the two missing Britons. In the post, Prigozhin’s press service said that they received a call to their hotline on Jan. 8 asking for help finding the two men.  “Today [Wednesday], one of those was found, along with documents for both,"" the post claimed. A subsequent post on the same Telegram channel published photos appearing to show two passports with the names of the missing Britons. On Jan. 9, Ukrainian police reported that they were searching for Bagshaw and Parry. Ukrainian police noted that the two Britons “left Kramatorsk for Soledar"" — the scene of intense recent fighting — ""and contact with them was lost."" The Russian Defense Ministry commission, headed by the Commander-in-Chief of Russia's ground forces Oleg Salyukov, has arrived in Belarus to inspect the Russian units of the joint forces, the Belarus Defense Ministry said in a statement Thursday.  ""The military units and subunits of the Russian component of the regional grouping of forces located at the training grounds of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus were inspected,"" the statement reads. ""In the course of the work, the quality of combat coordination classes was checked and an assessment was made of their readiness to fulfill their intended tasks in the interests of ensuring the military security of the Union State,"" reads the statement.  Salyukov is one of the three deputies of Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who has been appointed as the overall commander of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.  The Belarus Defense Ministry declared Wednesday that the joint air defense forces of Belarus and Russia have been reinforced, according to the ministry’s press service. More on Russia-Belarus relations: Some Russian forces are based in Belarus and used its territory in the initial invasion of Ukraine in February. But President Alexander Lukashenko has gone to some lengths to ensure that Belarus troops do not become involved in Russia's ""special military operation.""  In December, Ukraine warned it does ""not rule out"" a ""deliberate provocation"" from Russia after Belarus said that the wreckage of a Ukrainian missile landed on its territory.  CNN’s Eve Brennan contributed reporting to this post.  Ukraine has contested the Wagner mercenary group's claim that it has taken control of the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, saying that Russian forces are ""suffering heavy losses"" in continued fighting there. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian defense official has said that he expects a delivery of Leopard battle tanks from Poland to arrive ""very, very fast,"" in what would be the first delivery of a Western-made tanks to Ukraine since Russia invaded almost 11 months ago. Here are the latest headlines: Ukraine says battle for Soledar continues: Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempt to take Soledar, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar. On Tuesday, the Wagner mercenary group claimed it had taken complete control of the town, but Ukraine refutes that claim. “The approaches to the city today are actually strewn with the bodies of killed Putin's troops,"" Mailar said. 
            Peskov hails Russian efforts: Russian forces have fought hard to take Soledar, but more battles remain, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. ""Enormous effort has been done in Soledar. These are absolutely selfless heroic actions. Not only in Soledar, but in many areas where offensive operations are being carried out,” said Peskov. “The main work is still ahead.""
            Ukraine claims 100 Russian casualties: Ukrainian officials have claimed that a strike on a Russian position near Soledar has killed 100 enemy soldiers. In a statement published Thursday, the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said it had detected a “concentration of the enemy,” and employed artillery and a Soviet-designed missile system to carry out the attack. CNN cannot independently verify the claim, and Kyiv did not provide any evidence of such an attack.
            More than 500 civilians remain: As the struggle for the town rages, some 523 civilians are still in Soledar, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration. Evacuation is ""just unrealistic"" at the moment, Kyrylenko added.
            Ukraine expects tanks ""very, very fast"": Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, has said that a delivery of Leopard battle tanks from Poland will arrive ""very, very fast."" Polish President Andrzej Duda announced the plan to send Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Lviv on Wednesday, but a shipment of the German-made tanks would typically require approval from Germany.
            Grenade removed from soldier's body: A Ukrainian military doctor has removed part of an undetonated grenade from the body of an injured Ukrainian soldier. An X-ray image shows the fragment lodged in the soldier's torso, while another photo shows a doctor holding the grenade.  ##Catch Up## Russian forces have fought hard to take the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, but more battles remain, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. “Enormous effort has been done in Soledar. These are absolutely selfless heroic actions. Not only in Soledar, but in many areas where offensive operations are being carried out,” said Peskov. “The main work is still ahead,” he added. CNN asked Peskov whether the Kremlin is satisfied with the efforts of the Wagner mercenary group to take Soledar – as it has previously claimed – but the Kremlin spokesman didn't cite the private military company by name in his response. Conflicting reports are circulating about the status of Soledar. On Tuesday, Wagner claimed it is in complete control of the town, and a day later the Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had “blocked Soledar from the northern and southern parts” of the settlement. However, on Thursday, Ukraine said that fighting continues and Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempts to take Soledar. A Ukrainian military doctor has removed part of an undetonated grenade from the body of an injured soldier, according to a Facebook post from the Ukrainian Military Medics. An X-ray image that accompanied the post showed the fragment lodged in the soldier's torso, while another photo shows a doctor holding the grenade. The grenade was removed “in the presence of two sappers who were ensuring the safety of medical staff,"" reads the post. Doctors feared that the grenade could explode at any time during the operation, and therefore the surgery was conducted “without electrocoagulation,"" an electrical medical treatment that can be used to control bleeding. The surgery was a success and the soldier was “sent for further rehabilitation,"" reads the post. The grenade was a ""VOG grenade"" and is usually fired from a grenade launcher.  Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, has spoken bullishly about the delivery of tanks from Poland.  “I am more than sure the tanks that will be provided to us, it will be very, very fast,"" said Danilov on Ukrainian television. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will “master” the use of the tanks “in a matter of weeks,"" added Danilov. Polish President Andrzej Duda announced the plan to send Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Lviv on Wednesday.  It would be the first time a Western-made tank has been sent to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion.  Duda cautioned during a press conference that “a whole range of formal requirements, approvals and so on must also be met.” The Leopard tank is manufactured in Germany and a shipment would typically require permission to re-export a German-manufactured weapon.  CNN contacted the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action for comment, but spokesman Robert Säverin referred CNN to the Polish government. Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempt to take the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Mailar. “The approaches to the city today are actually strewn with the bodies of killed Putin's troops,"" she said. Mailar added that the fighting in the town is “fierce” and described Ukrainian soldiers as “fighting desperately,” but showing “maximum resilience and heroism."" The area around Soledar has seen intense fighting in recent days. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russian private military company Wagner, claimed Tuesday that his forces had taken control of the “entire territory of Soledar.”  But Mailar denied that was the case Wednesday afternoon. More than 500 civilians remain in Soledar as Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to struggle for control of the city, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration.  Speaking on Ukrainian television on Thursday morning, Kyrylenko said that “as of now, there are 523 people there.""  Most of the people left are over 50 years' old, he added, with ""no information"" that children are among their number.  ""It will not be correct if I say that they do not want to leave now. We are doing our best to help people to leave,” said Kyrylenko, adding that evacuation is ""just unrealistic"" at the moment. Evacuations will resume “when I know it is possible to get there by special transport and leave from there,"" he said. Russia claims to have made advances on Soledar in recent days, amid some of the fiercest fighting of the war.  Ukrainian officials have claimed that a strike on a Russian position near the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine has killed 100 enemy soldiers. In a statement published Thursday, the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said it had detected a “concentration of the enemy,” and employed artillery and a Soviet-designed missile system to carry out the attack. “As a result of these several strikes, the destruction of more than 100 occupiers, two machine gun crews and two mortar crews was confirmed,” Ukraine’s military stated, praising the work of its “Special Forces warriors, artillerymen and rocketeers.” CNN cannot independently verify the claim, and Kyiv did not provide any evidence of such an attack. In recent weeks Ukraine has claimed a number of attacks which it says have killed large numbers of Russian soldiers. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said around 500 Russian troops were either killed or wounded in a hit near Chulakivka, a town in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, on New Year's Eve.  CNN cannot independently verify that Ukrainian claim and Moscow has not publicly commented on it. However both Ukraine and Russia acknowledged a strike that took place just after midnight on New Year’s Day on a vocational school housing Russian conscripts in Makiivka, eastern Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported 89 Russian servicemen were killed in the strike, whereas the Ukrainian military reported higher figures, initially claiming up to around 400 Russian soldiers were killed. CNN cannot independently verify either side’s reported death toll, but that strike appears to be one of the deadliest episodes of the conflict for Moscow’s forces. Russian war crimes and human rights abuses during the war in Ukraine add up to a “litany of violations of international humanitarian law,” according to Human Rights Watch. In the rights group’s annual report reviewing human rights standards in nearly 100 countries, it said that evidence of war crimes in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, are part of a pattern that “has been repeated countless times.” HRW’s World Report 2023 also highlights the bombing of a theater in Mariupol, despite signs warning that children were sheltering there, as well as strikes on other non-military targets. “Inflicting civilian suffering, such as the repeated strikes on the energy infrastructure that Ukrainians depend on for electricity, water, and heat, seems to be a central part of the Kremlin’s strategy,” reads the report. Read more here. As the fight for control of the eastern Ukrainian towns of Soledar and Bakhmut continues, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show the extent of the destruction in the area. Some background: Soledar, a salt mine town in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, has been the site of intense fighting in recent days and a target for Russian forces since last May. The head of Russia's private military company claimed Tuesday that his forces had taken control of the ""entire territory of Soledar,"" but Kyiv officials deny the claim, insisting that the fight persists. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia sees its attempted capture of Soledar as a propaganda tool with which to maintain domestic support for its war. Should Russian troops indeed capture the town, it would mark Moscow's first gain in the Donbas for months —  potentially offering President Vladimir Putin some welcome news after a string of defeats on the battlefield since last summer. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced yet another realignment of the commanders leading the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, as criticism mounts over its handling of the stalled campaign. It said that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, would become the overall commander of the campaign, with the current commander, Sergey Surovikin, becoming one of his three deputies. Surovikin was only appointed as the overall commander of the what the Kremlin euphemistically calls the “Special Military Operation” in October. In terms of the bureaucratic hierarchy, the announcement is hardly an upheaval. Surovikin already reported to Gerasimov. “Generals are moved, shuffled from the Front to the Headquarters. From Headquarters to the Front,” Russian television commentator Sergey Markov said Wednesday on Telegram.
            “Surovikin is not punished and Gerasimov is not punished. It’s all one team. Well, of course with competition, which always happens among the top dogs.” But the decision puts Gerasimov, who has been chief of the General Staff for more than a decade, closer to direct supervision of the campaign — and to responsibility for it. While Gerasimov was a key figure in planning the invasion, he appears to have been at arms’ length since, with just one reported visit to the command of the campaign inside Ukraine, though the Defense Ministry did not confirm that either. Mark Galeotti, senior associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said “it is a kind of demotion [for Gerasimov] or at least the most poisoned of chalices. It’s now on him, and I suspect Putin has unrealistic expectations again.” Read the full analysis here. The British government is working with partners to discuss how to go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine, including the provision of tanks, according to the prime minister's spokesperson on Wednesday.  When asked by lobby journalists if the United Kingdom would supply tanks to Ukraine, the prime minister's spokesperson said, “We are accelerating our support to Ukraine with the kind of next-generation military technology that will help them win this war.""  ""It is clear that tanks could provide a game-changing capability to the Ukrainians and the prime minister told President Zelensky last week that we’ll provide whatever support we can,"" the spokesperson added. ""The prime minister has asked the Defence Secretary to work with partners in the coming weeks to discuss how we can go further and faster on our support to Ukraine including the provision of tanks."" But, while it is ""constantly looking at what equipment we can provide,"" that does not mean that any decisions have been made about providing Challenger 2 tanks right now, the spokesperson said. A Ukrainian soldier in the contested eastern town of Soledar told CNN Wednesday evening that he and his comrades remained in the settlement, but the situation was “very difficult” and the next 24 hours or so would be critical. “It is tough here, but we are more alive than anyone else,” the soldier, whom CNN is not identifying for security reasons, said via text message. The head of Wagner, the Russian private military company, claimed Tuesday that his forces had taken control of the “entire territory of Soledar.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tempered that sentiment on Wednesday, saying only there was a “positive trend.” The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its forces had “blocked Soledar from the northern and southern parts” of the settlement. “Don't believe what they say,” the Ukrainian soldier told CNN. “We're hanging in there. Though practically on our own. Without commanders.” He said that the next 24 hours would be “very difficult.” “During these days everything will be determined for the city. Because we are being trapped, they want to encircle us,"" he said. The soldier said that if the nearby Ukrainian units held their ground, his unit would be able to safely retreat. He said the Russians were jamming Ukrainian communications, making coordination extremely difficult. “It is not clear who our neighbors are, but someone is there and fighting. We have no connection with them,"" the solider said. Fighting is still raging in Soledar, a salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, despite Russian claims that it has gained control of the region. Should Russian troops indeed capture the town, it would mark Moscow’s first gain in the Donbas for months — potentially offering President Vladimir Putin some welcome news after a string of defeats on the battlefield since last summer. The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especially the Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer. Taking Soledar would also represent a symbolic PR win for the man who runs Wagner — oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has frequently criticized the Russian Defense Ministry’s management of the “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine. Read more about Soledar here. Russia’s defense minister has appointed Gen. Valery Gerasimov as commander of the Joint Group of Forces leading the country's so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine. Gerasimov replaces Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who had been appointed to the role on Oct. 8, 2022, and was in charge of Russian forces during their retreat from large swaths of Ukraine’s Kherson region. Surovikin will now serve as a deputy commander, according to a statement from the Russian Defense Ministry. “On 11 January 2023, Russian Defence Minister General of the Army Sergei Shoigu assigns new leadership of special military operation,” the ministry said Wednesday on its official Telegram channel.  “Chief of General Staff General of the Army Valery Gerasimov has been assigned the commander of the Joint Group of Forces,” it said. “The deputy commanders are: the Commander-in-Chief of Aerospace Forces General of the Army Sergei Surovikin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army General of the Army Oleg Salyukov, as well as the Deputy Chief of General Staff of Russian Armed Forces Colonel General Aleksey Kim,” it added. The ministry said the changes were necessary because of “the amplified range of tasks, the necessity of closer cooperation between services and branches of the Armed Forces, as well as of improving the quality of all types of maintenance and efficiency of commanding the groups of forces.”

                      Leaked Pentagon documents suggest Russian government infighting over Ukraine
                  ","
                      A fresh leak of classified US intelligence documents suggests broad infighting between Russian officials, including some within the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry, the New York Times reported Thursday.  CNN has not independently verified the documents. The NYT said it had shown the new 27-pages of documents to multiple US officials, who did not dispute the information but ""could not, and would not, independently verify the documents."" CNN has contacted the Pentagon for comment. The US has said that the first set of documents released last week were authentic but has said that some of the documents were not legitimate and had been altered.  The NYT report says the documents, which it reports were posted on one of the Discord servers, show infighting between the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry over Russia's casualty count for the war in Ukraine.  The new documents also indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin called Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to a meeting, believed to have taken place on February 22, to likely resolve a public dispute over ammunition supply, the NYT reports.  Prigozhin had accused Russia's defense establishment of creating ""major problems"" with ammunition supplies for his troops.  He went as far as accusing the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry of ""treason"" for failing to get ammunition to Wagner fighters and ""also not helping with air transport."" On February 23, CNN reported Prigozhin said that a shipment of ammunition was now on its way to his fighters, in a message and voice note published on his Telegram channel. The NYT report says the documents detail US monitoring of Russian intelligence and apparatus and military command. The original batch of highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks and reported on by CNN also revealed the degree to which the US has penetrated the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Wagner Group, largely through intercepted communications and human sources, which could now be cut off or put in danger.  The Kremlin said it doubts the ""reliability"" of reports of broad infighting between Russian officials, in response to a CNN question about the NYT article.  ""I don't know what these reports [of infighting] are based on, but I'm doubting their reliability and the author's understanding of the essence of what is happening inside Russia,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. The leaks on social media in recent weeks have flustered US officials, who fear the revelations about how Washington spies on allies and foes alike could put sensitive sources at risk, and compromise important foreign relationships.  Several of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, disclose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. Others divulge significant weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces prepare to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians -- and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the person behind the massive leak worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. CNN could not verify the article independently.  The Pentagon has also stood up an ""interagency effort"" to assess the impact of the leak, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Sunday, while the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the leaks last week.

                      Fear and confusion in Japan's Hokkaido as North Korean missile triggers evacuation order
                  ","
                      A North Korean missile sparked fear on the Japanese northern island of Hokkaido Thursday after the government's emergency alert system warned residents to take cover. Millions of people received a J-alert, or evacuation order, shortly before 8 a.m., urging them to seek shelter as the missile could land on or near the island. But soon after, fear turned into anger and confusion as the evacuation order was lifted amid reports that it had been sent in error, with local officials saying there was no possibility of the missile hitting the island and Tokyo later confirming it had fallen outside Japanese territory, in waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Many residents were critical of the decision to send the alert. ""What is the use of the J-Alert, which warns of a missile falling when you do not know where it will fall?"" asked one Twitter user. ""In the end, it serves no purpose other than to instill in the Japanese people the feeling that Japan is being targeted, and to scare them."" Another Twitter user said that even had the alert been warranted there would have been too little time to find shelter. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno defended the government's response at a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday, but admitted ""We did not correct the information issued by the J-Alert."" He said the alert was ""appropriate"" given the limited information available at the time and said the government had updated the alert once it was determined the missile would not fall near Hokkaido. This is not the first time there have been issues with the J-Alerts. Last October, Japan apologized for the malfunctioning of the early warning system when residents in nine of Tokyo's island towns and villages were mistakenly sent alerts. On that occasion, North Korea had fired a ballistic missile, but it did not pass over the communities who received the alerts. The latest alarm came after North Korea fired what appeared to be a mid or longer range ballistic missile from an area near Pyongyang, at around 7:23 a.m. local time Thursday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The White House said it ""strongly condemns"" the missile test. ""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions and instead choose diplomatic engagement.  The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" Watson added.  The South Korean military believes Pyongyang was testing a new ballistic missile, which it had showcased in a military parade, according to a military official. That missile could be solid-fueled, a type of missile that can be launched more quickly and moved around more easily than the liquid-fueled long-range missiles North Korea has tested in the past. The official added that there is a possibility that North Korea was testing a part of a reconnaissance satellite, such as a sensor. North Korea said last year that it would finish preparations to launch a military reconnaissance satellite by this month. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched at a lofted trajectory, flying about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). Meanwhile, Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said the missile may have been a type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the longest range of North Korea's ballistic missiles, but that Japanese authorities were continuing to analyze details. Hamada added that the missile fell into waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno called the launch ""an outrageous act that escalates provocations against the entire international community. ""North Korea's series of actions, including its repeated launches of ballistic missiles, is a threat to Japan, the region and the world,"" Matsuno said. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launch a ""significant act of provocation"" and urged Pyongyang to immediately stop, reiterating that ballistic missile launches are in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Thursday's launch marked the 12th day this year when North Korea has fired at least one missile.

                      Former J-pop star alleges sexual abuse by late Japanese music mogul Johnny Kitagawa
                  ","
                      A former J-pop star trainee came forward with allegations Wednesday that he and multiple other young men were sexually abused by the late Johnny Kitagawa, once a powerful figure in Japan's entertainment industry.  Japanese-Brazilian singer-songwriter Kauan Okamoto alleged during a press conference that over the course of four years, beginning in 2012 when he was 15, he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Kitagawa, who died age 87 in 2019. Okamoto said the abuse happened when he would stay overnight at one of Kitagawa's penthouse apartments in Tokyo, often with other young aspiring musicians who were also signed to Kitagawa's talent agency, Johnny & Associates. Okamoto made the allegations during a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan Wednesday, saying he was speaking out now in the hope that other alleged victims will come forward.  During his long career, Kitagawa headed Japan's biggest talent agency and was known for manufacturing popular boy-bands and launching the music and acting careers of teen idols. He was a powerful and influential figure in the media and entertainment industries for decades. Johnny & Associates sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the allegations. ""Since shifting to a new management team upon the death of our former President in 2019, we have made it our utmost priority to adapt to the changing environment by establishing transparency in our organizational structure and policies in a manner that evokes social trust,"" the statement said. ""In January 2023, we announced measures that will ensure strict compliance with laws and regulations without exception by both management and employees as well as the steps we are taking to strengthen corporate governance by consulting with impartial third party experts,"" it continued, without directly addressing the allegations. There have been long-standing allegations against Kitagawa. In 1999, Japanese magazine Shukan Bunshun published accounts of other young men and boys who claimed they were sexually abused by Kitagawa. He sued the magazine for libel and was awarded damages, according to local media. A Tokyo High Court partially overturned the earlier decision in 2003, ruling the published sexual abuse claims were not libelous. An appeal brought by Kitagawa was later dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2005. Kitagawa was never charged over the allegations. He had reportedly denied all accusations when he was alive.  They 'knew it was my turn' Singer-songwriter Okamoto joined Kitagawa's agency in February 2012 while he was in junior high school. He became a member of Johnny's Juniors, a J-pop trainee talent pool set up by Kitagawa for young hopefuls trying to make it in the industry.  Okamoto said Kitagawa would often invite these young recruits to spend the night in his apartment, and pick ""favorites"" among the boys. He told reporters that when Kitagawa told him ""you should go to bed early,"" the other Juniors ""knew that it was my turn."" He claims the first time Kitagawa sexually assaulted him was in March 2012. That day work had finished late and he stayed at Kitagawa's place with other Juniors. Okamoto said he had heard from other boys that Kitagawa would be ""in a very bad mood the next day if you didn't go to sleep in his room or a room nearby."" He describes hearing Kitagawa's slippers approaching his room, pulling off the futon he was sleeping under and lying down next to him.  ""He began massaging my feet,"" Okamoto said, and alleged that Kitagawa touched his genitals and performed oral sex on him. Okamoto said the following day Kitagawa gave him 10,000 yen (about US$75) without giving a reason.  By the time Okamoto left Johnny & Associates in 2016, he alleged that he had been assaulted between 15 and 20 times by Kitagawa.  He said he saw between 100 and 200 Juniors rotating in and out of the apartment during the four years he was with the agency, and alleged the majority of them were similarly assaulted by Kitagawa.  ""There were things I saw. In some instances it happened right next to me because we were sleeping in the same room. I would say three other members for sure, but to be honest I think that almost everyone fell victim to him because as long as we stayed at his place it would be very rare that someone would be unscathed,"" he said, adding that he believes ""the majority of the 100 to 200 during my time experienced that."" For a long time, Okamoto said he couldn't talk about his experiences.  ""There are others... who have decided to stay anonymous. I chose to show my face. But that might change as well. That is the hope that I have,"" he said.  Okamoto also alleged that if a boy refused Kitagawa's advances, their career would be over.  While Kitagawa ""would never directly or explicitly mention that if you don't do so and so, you won't be a success,"" Okamoto said, his favorites would be picked for their debuts as entertainers and receive more opportunities. ""It was a special situation in that someone who would be standing next to Johnny-san would be picked to, for example, act in a TV program or be allowed to form a boyband."" He said it was ""general awareness among everyone"" that ""you have to be at his place to succeed, so you have to even take the initiative to be at his place."" Okamoto said he was frustrated that long-standing allegations against Kitagawa had not been taken seriously. Okamoto said because of Kitagawa, ""my life did turn around"" but ""I also believe what Johnny-san did to me...and to the other Juniors was a bad thing.""

                      Screaming people and bodies everywhere: The horrific aftermath of Myanmar junta airstrike that killed 165
                  ","
                      Relatives were still recovering the charred bodies and limbs of victims killed in a military airstrike on a village in central Myanmar Wednesday, a day after one of the deadliest attacks since the junta seized power in a coup two years ago. An eyewitness, who hid in a tunnel during the attack, described a scene of horror as he approached the site of the military airstrike -- of children dying, women screaming, and bodies heaped on the ground.  At least 165 people, including 27 women and 19 children, were killed after Myanmar's military junta bombed Kanbalu township in the central Sagaing region on Tuesday, the human rights minister of the ousted shadow National Unity Government Aung Myo Min wrote on Twitter, before confirming the figures to CNN.  A further 30 people were wounded, 20 of whom remain in a serious condition including a pregnant woman and an eight-year-old child. Of those who died, 158 bodies have been cremated, Aung Myo Min added in his comments to CNN.  First responders and medical teams haven't been able to return to the site of the attack because military planes have continued flying over the town, though there have been no further strikes, Aung Myo Min said earlier. About 300 people had gathered in Pazigyi Village early on Tuesday morning to celebrate the opening of a local administration office, an eyewitness told CNN on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution. Families had traveled from nearby villages for the event, where tea and food was offered and which coincided with the start of the Thingyan New Year celebrations.  Like much of Sagaing, the area is not under the control of the military junta. The new town office was being opened under the authority of the shadow National Unity Government (NUG), for the people, as part of the anti-junta resistance. ""We didn't have any warning,"" the eyewitness said. ""Most of the villagers were inside the event, so they didn't notice the jet."" Just before 8 a.m., a junta aircraft bombed the village where the ceremony was being held, the eyewitness and local media reported. An Mi35 helicopter then circled and fired on the village minutes later, the eyewitness told CNN.  ""When I arrived at the scene we tried to search for people still alive,"" he said. ""Everything was terrible. People were dying (as they were being transported) on motorbikes. Children and women. Some lost their heads, limbs, hands. I saw flesh on the road."" The eyewitness said he saw dozens of bodies after the attack, including children as young as five. He said he lost four family members in the strike, and a young child from his village was among the dead.  ""I saw lots of people coming onto the scene to search for their kids, crying and screaming,"" he said.  At around 5:30 p.m. the junta jets returned and shot the same place they had bombed that morning, he said.  CNN cannot independently verify the incident but the eyewitness's account matches reports in local media and from the NUG.  Videos and images from the aftermath, shown to CNN from witnesses and a local activist group, also show bodies, some burned and in pieces, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris. Myanmar's junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun confirmed the airstrike on Pazigyi Village and said if civilian casualties occurred it was because they were forced to help ""terrorists.""  The junta has designated the NUG and resistance groups known as the People's Defense Force in the country as terrorists.  ""At 8 a.m.... NUG (National Unity Government) and PDF (People's Defense Force) conducted an opening ceremony of the public administration office at Pazigyi village,"" Zaw Min Tun said on the military's Myawaddy TV channel.  ""We had launched the attack on them. We were informed that PDF were killed at that event under the attack. They are opposing our government."" The strike was condemned internationally, with one top UN official saying global indifference to the situation in Myanmar contributed to the attack. ""The Myanmar military's attacks against innocent people, including today's airstrike in Sagaing, is enabled by world indifference and those supplying them with weapons,"" said Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar. ""How many Myanmar children need to die before world leaders take strong, coordinated action to stop this carnage?"" The US Department of State said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the airstrikes and called on the regime to ""cease the horrific violence."" ""These violent attacks further underscore the regime's disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma following the February 2021 coup,"" it said, using an alternative name for Myanmar. It's been just over two years since the military seized power, ousting the democratically elected government and jailing its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In order to crush resistance, the junta regularly carries out airstrikes and ground attacks on what it calls ""terrorist"" targets. The attacks have killed civilians, including children, and targeted schools, clinics, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Whole villages have been burned by junta soldiers and thousands of people have been displaced in the attacks, according to local monitoring groups.  Battles between the military and resistance groups unfold daily across Myanmar. These rebel groups, some of whom have aligned with some of the country's long-established ethnic militias, effectively control parts of the country out of the junta's reach. Resistance groups and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly accused Myanmar's military of carrying out mass killings, air strikes and war crimes against civilians in the regions where fighting has raged, charges the junta repeatedly denies -- despite a growing body of evidence. ""They're losing control of the country. They're losing ground. Things are much more unstable on the ground than they've ever been,"" the UN's Andrews told CNN on Wednesday. ""As a result of that, they're using air power more and more and, of course, as they do so, more and more civilians are being killed."" On Monday, junta airstrikes hit a town in western Chin state's Falam Township, killing nine people when bombs dropped on a school, according to local media Myanmar Now and The Irrawaddy.  Last week, 8,000 refugees in southern Karen state fled across the border to Thailand, escaping fighting in Myawaddy township, according to a statement from Thailand's Tak provincial office public relations department, posted to Facebook.  In March, at least 22 people, including three monks, were killed at a monastery in southern Shan state. And a military airstrike on a school in Sagaing in September killed at least 13 people, including seven children. The eyewitness to Tuesday's attack said the ""situation in Myanmar is worse now."" ""People are dying like dogs or cows. We don't have any weapons to compare with what the military has. We need the help of the international community,"" he said.

                      Delta Air Lines reports record bookings for summer travel
                  ","
                      Delta Air Lines reported record advanced bookings for this coming summer, a further sign that the US airline industry is putting the pandemic-caused losses behind it. But rising labor costs did result in a net loss in the period, even if the company reported a profit when excluding special items, the measure most closely followed by investors. The Atlanta-based airline earned $163 million, excluding special items, in the first three months of the year, compared to a loss of $784 million on that basis a year earlier. Revenue of $11.8 billion was up 45% from a year earlier, and up 14% from the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. The strong demand for flying means higher fares for customers. The amount passengers paid to fly each mile on Delta was up 17% compared to both a year earlier and the same period in 2019. Total passenger revenue when adjusted for capacity, another key measure of fares, was up 27% compared to a year ago and 14% from the same period in 2019. And planes were fuller, with Delta selling 81% of available seats, up from 75% a year earlier. The second quarter revenue and earnings were slightly below Wall Street forecasts, which the company attributed to flights canceled due to bad weather. But shares of Delta were higher in pre-market trading due to its strong forecast going forward.  The company said the record second-quarter bookings will allow it to post earnings per share of between $2 and $2.25, well above the current forecast of $1.66. For the full year, the company expects earnings per share of between $5 and $6, which could put it well above the $5.40 forecast from analysts. The company did take a one-time charge of $864 million related to the four-year labor deal it reached with pilots that will increase their pay 34% over the life of the contract. It provides them with an immediate 18% raise and a signing bonus that cost the airline $735 million. The charge for that signing bonus and change in benefits resulted in a net loss in the quarter of $363 million.  The airline also gave 5% raises to many of its other employees as of April 1. The pilots are the only major employee group at Delta who are union members. Other major US airlines, which are far more heavily unionized, face upcoming negotiations with a majority of their employees, and could also see rising labor costs in upcoming financial results.

                      US inflation just reached an inflection point
                  ","
                      After more than a year of soaring prices monopolizing the attention of Wall Street, Main Street, economists, and journalists, the tide may be turning.  According to some experts, inflation rates have reached an inflection point and painful interest rate hikes could soon ease.  The US Consumer Price Index, a widely used measure of inflation, has shown a significant deceleration since it shot up by 9% in June 2022. As of now, CPI inflation stands at 5%, the lowest it has been since May 2021.  Some economists believe that this level — around 5% — is the point at which inflation is no longer considered an emergency issue. That means the Federal Reserve could feel less pressure to quickly stabilize prices through aggressive, economically painful interest rate hikes.  ""Once inflation gets down below 5%. It disappears from the headlines,"" Johns Hopkins economist and central bank scholar Laurence Ball told Before the Bell last month. ""People go back to worrying about budget deficits or climate change or other public issues there are."" The 5% idea dates back at least to the 1980s when former Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer identified the threshold number as the point where inflation dropped way down the rankings of the nation's problems.  While the Federal Reserve maintains a target inflation rate of 2%, said Ball, ""I can imagine that a few years from now, inflation could still be at 3 or 4% and it won't be a front burner issue.""  Barry Ritholtz of Ritholtz Wealth Management echoed that sentiment on Wednesday. ""A 5 handle is a huge development,"" he wrote.  Other economists have backed the idea: A recent study by the economics department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that there was no significant economic pullback with inflation targets around 5%.  ""Our findings suggest that it is not typically necessary to force down inflation to such low levels, especially given that contractionary monetary policies succeed in controlling inflation primarily through the channel of raising mass unemployment and weakening workers' bargaining power,"" they wrote.  ""The Fed ... will insist that their job is done when inflation hits 2%,"" Ball told Before the Bell on Wednesday. But if inflation floats above that target while remaining relatively low, ""that's a situation where a lot of people, including me, are doubtful that the Fed will really act on what it's saying,"" he added. It's not necessarily a bad number for the stock market, either. An analysis of stock performance by BlackRock dating back to 1920 found that as long as inflation doesn't cross 10%, equities continue to perform relatively well. Between 1966 and 1999, nominal annual returns averaged 12.3% against an average 5% annual inflation rate. Still, there's a 67% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter percentage point at its next meeting in May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Brainard: US banking system is 'sound' and 'stable' The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were ""poorly managed"" and ""took unacceptable risks,"" White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor's World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs.  ""The banking system, it's very sound, it's stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,"" said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. ""There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,"" she said. ""Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,"" she continued. How to avoid another crisis? Banks could hold more cash Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board, a body of global regulators and government officials, wrote in a letter released Wednesday that — unlike other recent shocks to financial markets — crises at US regional banks and Credit Suisse in March originated from ""within the financial system."" Later on Wednesday, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said that regulators could now place stricter liquidity requirements on lenders. So what does that mean? My colleague Anna Cooban reports: Banks could be told to hold more assets that can be easily converted into cash to pay back creditors in times of crisis.

                      New Jersey wildfire 75% contained as all roads to reopen soon, officials say
                  ","
                      The wildfire in New Jersey that has burned nearly 4,000 acres in is 75% contained are to reopen, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service tweeted Wednesday night. The blaze that began in Manchester Township on Tuesday evening has burned 3,859 acres, authorities said, and all of the previously announced road closures in the area were to be lifted at 9 p.m. The service said its personnel will continue to work in several locations and urged residents to ""stay vigilant while driving through smoke conditions,"" because firefighters may be working on the side of the road. The fire remains under investigation, the forest service added. The fire came as record heat sets in across the Northeast. This single fire has burned more than half the average acres burned in New Jersey in an entire year, according to statistics from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. About 170 structures in the Manchester Township area were evacuated Tuesday night, but all residents have since been allowed to return home, Manchester Police Chief Robert Dolan said during a news conference Wednesday. No structures are damaged and no injuries have been reported, officials said, but firefighters have faced ""extreme fire behavior,"" said John Cecil, the assistant commissioner of state parks, forests and historic sites at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  ""We saw a wall of fire, 200-foot flames, raining fire embers. I don't mean to be dramatic, but this was a severe situation that these guys and gals managed to keep in place and protect lives and property. And for that, we cannot thank them enough,"" Cecil said. The fire was primarily burning on federal, state and private property in Manchester Township, but it had jumped to the adjacent borough of Lakehurst. Record heat will make fire conditions even worse Summerlike temperatures are expected to last through Friday, with more than 25 potential high records falling. ""We've been under high pressure the past couple of days. This is drying out the 'fuels' (dry brushland, dead leaves etc.). We should stay under high pressure for the next day,"" Cameron Wunderlin, National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, New Jersey, told CNN. ""Relative humidity drops very low with this flow around the high and all the ingredients are there for the fire weather concerns."" The record heat will only make fire conditions worse during the week, as temperatures soar into the mid-80s across New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast along the I-95 corridor. Overnight temperatures will also remain high, which will create challenging conditions for firefighters. Nighttime temperatures will only drop to the low 60s or upper 50s, which won't allow for much recovery overnight.  ""Relative humidity is calculated by temperature and the amount of moisture,"" Wunderlin said. ""So if you have record highs and low humidity, the relative humidity will drop below the 30% threshold that we look for extreme fire behavior."" Places like New York City, New Brunswick, New Jersey, and even Philadelphia could break records Friday with temperatures expected to top out in the mid-80s.  Springfield, Massachusetts, could shatter its previous record of 77 by nearly 10 degrees if it hits the forecast high of 86 on Friday. Winds will remain a factor as sustained winds are expected to stay around 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.  April is considered peak fire season for New Jersey. The state has seen other large fires in recent years, including one just last year that scored more than 13,000 acres. The fire in 2022 was roughly 50 miles from where the current fire is burning.

                      Whitney Austin, who survived a 2018 mass shooting of a bank in Cincinnati, Ohio, called for gun reform during her remarks at Wednesday's vigil in Louisville, Kentucky.  ""Monday morning was heartbreakingly familiar to me. I've done this before,"" said Austin, who was shot 12 times during the mass 2018 shooting. She encouraged the community to lift the victims and first responders in prayer and support them.  She also advocated for gun reform, ""It is only through action that change will ever come.""  The Louisville Metro Police Department has released all of the 911 calls it plans to distribute from the bank shooting, according to department spokesperson Aaron Ellis. Twelve 911 calls and two emergency responder radio transmissions were released Wednesday. ##911 Audio## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence A woman called 911 on Monday morning after seeing an officer go down after being shot at outside Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky.  “We saw one officer down,” the woman relays to the dispatcher. Another witness describes the scene to the dispatcher as they watched the incident from across the street. “I just wanted to make sure you understood that there was an officer down,” the male witness tells the dispatcher. “There are several officers here now, but the one hasn’t moved since he’s been shot. Two have been shot at.” “I’ve been watching him consistently, I haven’t seen a foot or anything moving,” he added, “He went down right away when the bullets started firing,” Officer Nickolas Wilt is in critical condition after he was shot in the head during a confrontation with the gunman. His colleague, Officer Cory “CJ” Galloway, suffered a minor bullet wound. ##911 Audio## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. Additional  911 calls released by the Louisville Metro Police Department detail concerns from employees in the bank building where the shooting took place on Monday.   “We are on the 4th floor, we are trying to get the status of what’s going on,” the caller says, “We’re tucked under a desk right now.” The 911 operator calmly tells the caller to remain in place as police officers clear the building: “As far as my understanding, the shooter has been taken into custody. As far as my understanding, the scene is safe at the moment.”  The shooter was killed in a gun battle with police at the scene.  The 911 operator tells the caller everyone should stay put while officers search the building to make sure there were no other threats. The caller agrees and says all the doors are locked.  “Officers may be coming toward that area and they will be announcing themselves as officers,” the operator says. ##911 Audio## Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan had a message for employees attending the community vigil in Louisville and watching virtually: “To all of you please know we will get through this together."" A mass shooter, who police said was an employee, opened fire at the bank on Monday morning, killing five people and injuring several others. Ryan said there are ""no words"" to describe what happened or how the victim's families are feeling. ""The greatest way we can continue to honor everyone that has been impacted by this tragedy is to do our best to follow their example,"" he said. ""We need to love one another, we need to care for one another and we need to support one another."" He said he is praying for both the employees and police officers that were hurt and are still recovering and thanked first responders, medical teams and the Louisville community for their support. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear responded Wednesday to the release of 911 audio from the deadly Louisville bank shooting.  ""This person murdered my friend. But still, I can't imagine how his parents must be feeling. Right now,"" Beshear said.  Beshear's friend Tommy Elliott, a bank executive, was killed by the gunman.  The governor said he wanted his friend to be remembered as a loving father and husband.  ""Man, he had a great smile. His eyes lit up. Loved life. Was always into something. Trying to make the city a better place, he was just always into something,"" he said, in his first interview since the tragic shooting, with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Elliott, the bank's senior vice president, had chaired Beshear's 2019 inaugural committee and was a well-known figure in Kentucky Democratic politics. ""He was trying to plan for me for when I'm done being governor, which was something that I hoped we could eventually plan for together,"" Beshear said. ""An amazing human being, a loving dad."" One of the 911 calls released Wednesday included one from the mother of the gunman.  Relaying details from her son's roommate, she said her son ""apparently left a note"" as she expressed her shock and confusion. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said in the call. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh, my Lord."" Hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear here: ##911 Audio## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said there will be a time for action and change, but now is a time to mourn those killed in a mass shooting at a bank Monday. At a community vigil Wednesday evening, the mayor said whether people knew any of the victims personally or not, it is important to “acknowledge that every violent death is tragic."" He said it's also important to support those who survived the shooting through their physical and mental healing. “We are all in pain right now,"" he said. “Everyone I’ve spoken to since Monday is sharing some version of the same experience – and too many people have had this experience before this week,"" Greenberg added, referring to the dozens of people he said have been killed by gun violence in the city so far this year. He said the vigil and other kinds of reflection are important so that grief can be turned into action. ""That day is coming. Today is to mourn,"" Greenberg said. The mayor also thanked the people who have brought ""light and love"" during a tragic week, including first responders and police officers. A second batch of 911 calls from the Old National Bank mass shooting has been released by the Louisville Metro Police Department Tuesday evening. The additional audio includes six clips of calls to 911 from the shooting and one clip of LMPD radio traffic. CNN is looking through the calls. ##911 Audio## The FBI is asking for people in Louisville, Kentucky, to share what they know about the mass shooting that killed at least five people at a bank earlier this week.

            Call 502-574-LMPD It’s still not clear what provoked the 25-year-old bank employee to open fire. Workers inside Old National Bank during Monday's mass shooting were desperate for help as police responded to the scene, 911 calls from the incident revealed.  “We have an active shooter in our building,” a male caller inside the building said, identifying the shooter as “an employee of Old National Bank.”
            “Get here now! We need somebody now!” the caller said.

""I just saw a shotgun as he was coming around the corner,” he said. “People have been shot.” The caller said he believed there were more than a dozen people in the room as shots were fired. “Please get people there fast, please… and ambulances, please” he said. “We’re going to get them out there,” the operator responded. “Keep yourself safe, OK? Stay in a safe location.” ##911 Audio## Radio transmissions made in the wake of the shooting released by Louisville police Wednesday show how EMS responded and organized to get medical attention to those inside the building. Emergency responders on the radio calls discussed and coordinated where the victims were located inside the building, their conditions, and who was responding. Here's what they said:  “The shooter has been eliminated…and they’re doing a search of the building at this time,” one responder radios.  Another says that there is “possibly a female hiding in the bathroom” who is on the phone with emergency services.  “We have one victim that’s been brought out to the corner of Preston and Main,” another responder radios.  Several emergency responders radio back and forth about the status of a police officer who was wounded before learning that the officer was already being transported to a hospital. “Where’s the officer?” someone asks.  “That’s what I’m trying to figure out,” another person replies, adding later that “the officer is actually being transported in the police car right now.” Other emergency staff give updates over the radio on victims they located inside.  “We have a patient also in the building…the center of the building, first floor bathroom. Female shot in the leg,” someone radios before new reports of more victims found come over the radio.  “Just to add to your count, we have another victim. It looks like a gunshot wound to the (redacted),” another emergency responder reports.  During the radio calls, emergency staff is told that a command center is being set up at the Slugger baseball stadium and everyone is told to bring any witnesses to the stadium. In one call over the radio, an emergency responder says they’re being diverted from the location to handle another shooting in the city.  “We’re responding to another shooting…at the Goodwill,” the person radios. Radio transmissions also describe officers arriving at the shooter’s house, encountering individuals there and ultimately securing the home.  “Cleared the house from what I understand,” a person radios.  ##911 Audio## Officials in Louisville, Kentucky, are preparing to host a vigil tonight to grieve the five people killed this week in a downtown bank shooting.  The city will hold a vigil at 5 p.m. ET Wednesday at the Muhammad Ali Center, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. The vigil will “acknowledge the wounds, physical and emotional, that gun violence leaves behind,” Greenberg told reporters Tuesday. “It will be an interfaith opportunity for our entire community to come together – to grieve, to heal, to begin to move forward.” A woman who called 911 said she saw a man with some type of assault rifle and bulletproof vest “jogging around” near the time of the shooting in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday. When the dispatcher asked if the person was shooting, she said, “No, ma’am he was kind of like jogging around like he was trying to get somewhere in a hurry.”   Though that's how the woman described the shooter, the gunman was not wearing a bulletproof vest, according to surveillance video during the shooting. The 911 call is among a set of calls that were released by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) on Wednesday related to the mass shooting that left five people dead. Yesterday, LMPD released dramatic bodycam video of officers responding to the attack.  This post has been updated throughout. ##911 Audio## A woman called 911 from inside Old National Bank in Louisville as she was hiding in a closet in the building during Monday’s shooting. The woman, who worked at the bank, told the dispatcher she believed eight or nine people were shot.  “I know who it is. He’s probably 6 feet tall; he’s a young male,” the woman told the dispatcher.  When the dispatcher asked the woman how she knew the gunman, she responded, “he works with us.” During the call with the woman, multiple shots can be heard as she sheltered in the closet. First responders can be heard making contact with the woman after the shooting ceased. ##911 Audio## A worker of Old National Bank witnessed the shooting while participating in a video meeting on Monday morning and called 911 after seeing the gunman walk into the meeting room. “There’s an active shooter there,” the caller said in a 911 call that was released on Wednesday. The woman said she works at a different branch of the bank. The woman was in distress, yelling and crying as she described to the dispatcher what she saw. “I see somebody on the floor and we heard multiple shots and everyone started saying ‘Oh my god’ and then he came into the board meeting,” she added.  ##911 Audio##  The Louisville Metropolitan Police Department (LMPD) clarified Wednesday that there ""was no discussion about [the shooter] being terminated, and of course he wasn't fired,"" from his bank job prior to Monday's fatal workplace shooting. “He was an active employee there at Old National Bank, but there was no discussion about this individual being terminated,” LMPD Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel told CNN.  The mother of the shooter who killed five people at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday called 911 after hearing secondhand that her son had a gun and was heading toward the bank. The mother made the call at 8:41 a.m. local time, three minutes after the first 911 call came in about the shooting. The mom said she was receiving details secondhand from the shooter’s roommate, who called her.  ""I don’t know anything,"" she said in clear distress. ""But we don’t even own guns; I don’t know where he would have gotten a gun.""  ""I know he doesn’t own any guns,"" she told the operator.  She told the operator multiple times that her son is not violent. “He’s never hurt anyone; he’s a really good kid. Please don’t punish him,” she said to the operator.  “He’s nonviolent; he’s never done anything,” she said later in the call. The mother asked the operator what she should do and if she should go to the bank. The operator told the mother that she has already received multiple calls to Old National Bank. ""You’ve had calls from other people? So he’s already there?"" she asked. 
            “Yes,” the operator said. 
            “I am advising you not to go to the location because it is [an] unsafe location and officers are already at the location, ma’am,” the operator said.  The mother thanked the phone operator and said goodbye. Police said in a news briefing Tuesday that the shooter used an AR-15-style rifle – the choice weapon of many US mass shooters – that he’d legally bought six days before the attack. ##911 Audio## The 911 calls from the Old National Bank mass shooting have been released by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD).  LMPD has released six clips of calls to 911 from the shooting and one clip of LMPD radio traffic. The clips range from 50 seconds to roughly 32 minutes long.  CNN is looking through the calls and will provide the latest updates.  ##911 Audio## Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead. During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was ""neutralized"" approximately three minutes after police responded. ""It's about a nine-minute span from the time he begins his assault,"" Cromwell said. ""And then there's a few minutes after that, before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that, when we respond to the scene. And then about three minutes after, we respond, the subject is neutralized."" Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.  Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a ""targeted"" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police. How it unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman was killed in a shootout with officers, police said. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report. ##Catch Up##  Officials are expected to release audio of 911 calls Wednesday about the shooting, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. It was among more than 145 shootings reported in the US this year with at least four victims, excluding a gunman. Police have already released dramatic police body camera footage of Monday’s shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say the bank employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The attacker, livestreaming the gruesome assault, fatally shot five of his coworkers in Kentucky’s most populous city around 8:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before the bank was to open, authorities said. Several others were hospitalized, including a rookie police officer who was shot in the head and was in critical condition Tuesday. “Our city is heartbroken,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. “These five victims should not be dead – just like everyone else who was killed by gun violence in our city, in our country, should not be dead.” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that at least 40 people have been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. ""This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. You may think this will never happen to you, never happen to any of your friends or loved ones. I used to think that. The sad truth is that now no one in our city, no one in our state, no one in our country has that luxury anymore,"" he continued. Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence. ""Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how we reduce gun violence in our city,"" he said. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for congressional Republicans to pass gun reform policies, saying that the issue is not political. ""We need policies in place that will keep this from happening again so that thoughts and prayers do not have to be offered to get another community ripped apart by the savage violence coming from guns,"" McGarvey said in a Tuesday briefing. ""I had somebody tell me the other day, 'don't make this political.' Fine. Don't make this political. People's lives aren't political. Public safety isn't political. Put those policies in place that put people first. People over guns, kids over guns, public safety over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem,"" McGarvey added. McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove firearms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in a bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks. A 26-year-old rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago – was hospitalized after being shot in the head while responding to a mass shooting Monday at a downtown bank that left five people dead and others injured, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Officer Nickolas Wilt underwent brain surgery after being struck during a shootout in the bank that left the gunman dead, Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department, said Monday afternoon during a news conference. The officer was still in critical condition Tuesday afternoon. “They have him sedated. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It’s just a wait and see,” LaGrange Fire Chief Jim Sitzler told CNN. Wilt is a volunteer firefighter with the department, Sitzler said. Wilt was new to the police department, having graduated from the police academy on March 31, according to the fire chief. Read more about Officer Wilt here. Five people were killed after a workplace shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday morning. The city is set to honor the victims in a vigil Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET.  Here’s what we know so far about the lives lost: Joshua Barrick, 40, and his family were members of the Holy Trinity Parish Louisville, the church wrote on Facebook. ""Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,"" they wrote. ""Please keep the entire Barrick family in your prayers, including his wife, Jessica, and their two sweet children, who are students in our school."" Deana Eckert, 57, was one of the hospitalized victims who later died Monday, police announced. It’s unclear if she was among the three people in critical condition earlier in the day. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg described Eckert as a ""very kind and a very thoughtful person."" Tommy Elliott, Old National Bank senior vice president, is remembered by local and state leaders as a close mentor and beloved community leader. ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" state Sen. David Yates told CNN. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up."" Elliott, 63, was also close friends with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott’s wife. ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and also called the others who were killed ""amazing people"" who will be missed and mourned by their communities. Juliana Farmer, 45, was also an employee of the bank who had just started a new chapter in her life by moving to Louisville from Henderson, her aunt Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WFIE. It had only been her third week on the job, according to Brooks-Scott. She last talked to her niece on Easter. ""She loved life,"" Brooks-Scott said. ""She was a beautiful young lady. All I can say is that heaven has gained a beautiful angel."" Farmer leaves behind three children, four grandchildren, and a fifth due in September, according to her aunt. James ""Jim"" Tutt, 64, was a ""huge fan and supporter"" of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN. Tutt worked as the CRE market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, according to his LinkedIn. He was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization, since 2018 and recently served as its treasurer. CNN’s Caroll Alvarado, Celina Tebor, Elizabeth Wolfe, Laura Ly, John Miller and Holly Yan contributed to this report. A 25-year-old man in Kentucky legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership. Six days later he used that weapon to kill five of his colleagues at a downtown bank, Louisville Metro Police said Tuesday. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. Gun enthusiasts have described it as “one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi.” By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state’s laws as “among the worst in the country.” Kentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. “Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there’s no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they’re ever used in a crime,” CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said. “Red flag” laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out. If the Louisville mass shooter’s behavior “had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,” she said. Prior to 2019 – when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit – individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. “They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,” Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there’s no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over. Read more here.  The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage Tuesday showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory ""CJ"" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.
            Officer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since Wilt was new to the force, he was acting based on ""his training and his character"" and that he ""never hesitates."" Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said.
            What happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them ""trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,"" Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.
            Bystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. Viewers can see an officer outside the bank.
            Before police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. ##Catch Up##  The family of the gunman who killed five people Monday in a bank shooting in Louisville, Kentucky, told CNN affiliate WDRB that they knew the 25-year-old struggled with depression, but saw no signs he was planning or capable of such violence. In a statement obtained by WDRB on Tuesday night, the family said that ""while Connor, like many of his contemporaries, had mental health challenges which we, as a family, were actively addressing, there were never any warning signs or indications he was capable of this shocking act.""  ""While we have many unanswered questions, we will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials and do all we can to aid everyone in understanding why and how this happened,"" according to the statement.  The family also praised police and expressed sadness for the victims of their son's actions.  ""No words can express our sorrow, anguish, and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people, their families, and the entire Louisville community,"" according to his family. ""We mourn their loss and that of our son, Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized by his senseless acts of violence and are deeply grateful for the bravery and heroism of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department."" This is what it means to serve and protect in a nation awash in guns. Harrowing, yet humbling, body camera footage of two Louisville officers who rushed into gunfire in Kentucky on Monday shows the demands placed upon police who respond to America's proliferating mass shootings and the terrible price they may pay. Video of what is effectively a street battle more akin to a foreign war zone than a US city basking in the morning sunshine offers a visceral antidote to the collective national shoulder shrug that often follows gun massacres. This is a raw, frightening scene, laced with courage and heroism. It offers a reality check about what unfolds in moments of terror and leaves the regular post-massacre political rituals of ""thoughts and prayers"" and doomed calls for gun reform looking empty by comparison. Some might question the need for Americans to see this disturbing footage. But it offers context to the bitter and often futile public debate about how to stop mass shootings and helps the public understand the horror they involve.  Here's what the footage shows: The breathtaking video shows rookie Officer Nickolas Wilt driving up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. After they take fire coming from inside the bank, Wilt slams the car into reverse before getting out with his handgun. Galloway races to the trunk to retrieve his service rifle. Then, without hesitating, they both advance up a set of steps — despite having no idea where the shooter, who turned out to be lying in wait, actually was. Suddenly, Galloway is down on the ground, with a minor gunshot wound after a deafening burst of fire. Wilt, who is blurred in the footage, lies shot in the head — another victim of the weapons of war that are often the preferred choice of mass killers. He is a good guy with a gun who was outgunned by a bad guy with a more powerful weapon. Galloway scrambles for some cover, and then is heard talking to other officers as they try to get a fix on the shooter's position — behind the glare of glass that means he can see them but they can't see him. Galloway, focused and in command, strategizes on how to challenge the shooter again and how to aid the fallen Wilt. Acting quickly is critical. And in a volley of shots, the shooter makes a fatal error, breaking a window in the bank, where four victims already lay dead and one mortally wounded. This gives Galloway a sightline. He shoots and yells, ""I think he's down ... get the officer!"" referring to Wilt, his trainee, who was shot on only his fourth time out on patrol. He's in the hospital in critical condition. ""What you saw in that video was absolutely amazing. It's tragic but it's absolutely amazing,"" Deputy Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey said, when he released the video. ""There's only a few people in this country that can do what they did. Not everybody can do that."" Read the full analysis here.

                      Florida death row inmate Louis Gaskin executed for 1989 murders
                  ","
                      A man on death row in Florida for the 1989 killing of a couple was executed Wednesday evening, the Florida Department of Corrections said in a news release.  Louis Gaskin was sentenced to death in 1990 for the fatal shooting of Robert Sturmfels, 56, and Georgette Sturmfels, 55, on December 20,1989, according to court documents. Gov. Ron DeSanits signed Gaskin's death warrant March 13, according to the documents, and the state Supreme Court rejected appeals filed by Gaskin since the warrant was signed. The latest denial for a stay of execution was issued by a judge on Tuesday, court documents show.  Jurors recommended the death sentence in a 8-4 vote, which was accepted by the judge, according to court records. Gaskin was also convicted of armed robbery, burglary and an attempted murder committed the same night, according to court documents. Gaskin's execution comes six weeks after Donald Dillbeck, 59, was put to death for the 1990 murder of Faye Vann, 44, in Tallahassee, and three weeks before the scheduled execution of Darryl B. Barwick for slaying Rebecca Wendt, 24, in 1986 in Panama City, according to CNN affiliate WTXL.   Dillbeck, who died via a lethal injection in February, was the 100th person to be executed by the state of Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to the department.   Before Gaskin's execution, there were 298 people on death row in the state, according to the corrections department website. CNN has reached out to Gaskin's attorney for comment.

                      US prosecutors tell family of Shanquella Robinson they won't pursue charges in her death in Mexico
                  ","
                      Federal prosecutors told the family of Shanquella Robinson on Wednesday that the evidence they have isn't enough for prosecution in Robinson's death last year in Mexico, the US Attorneys' Offices for the Middle and Western Districts of North Carolina said.  Robinson, a 25-year-old former student at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina, died in October while staying in a luxury rental property in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur.  ""Based on the results of the autopsy and after a careful deliberation and review of the investigative materials by both U.S. Attorneys' Offices, federal prosecutors informed Ms. Robinson's family today that the available evidence does not support a federal prosecution,"" the US Attorneys' Offices said in a release Wednesday. Family members are ""very deeply disappointed"" in the decision, but are ""not deterred"" and plan to continue to seek justice for Robinson, their attorney, Sue-Ann Robinson, said at a news conference.  ""Black and brown people always have to carve their own path to justice,"" attorney Robinson said. Shanquella Robinson was a Black American from North Carolina.  A copy of Shanquella Robinson's death certificate, obtained by CNN affiliate WBTV, listed the cause of death as ""severe spinal cord injury and atlas luxation,"" which is instability or excessive movement in the uppermost neck vertebrae. The document stated she was found unconscious in the living room of the rental residence on October 29. The death certificate classified Shanquella Robinson's death as ""accidental or violent,"" noting that the approximate time between injury and death was 15 minutes. Video posted online appeared to show a physical altercation inside a room between Shanquella Robinson and another person. It's not clear when the video was taken or if the video depicted the moment she suffered the fatal injury. At the time, Bernard Robinson confirmed to CNN it is his daughter seen in the video being thrown to the floor and beaten on the head. It's unclear what led to the altercation or how many people were in the room at the time. It's also unclear if anyone tried to intervene. The FBI conducted ""a detailed and thorough investigation of the evidence"" and worked with the Robinson family to conduct an autopsy in the United States by the Medical Examiner's Office in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the release said.  Federal officials met with the Robinson family and representatives on Wednesday ""to offer their condolences and present the findings of the federal investigation,"" the release said. According to attorney Robinson, the family was told that the FBI interviewed Shanquella Robinson's travel mates and ""people who were in the house,"" but did not specify how many people they interviewed. The US officials told the family that the autopsy, which was completed after Shanquella Robinson's body had been embalmed and transported back to the US, revealed no spinal cord injury but did show swelling on her brain, although the cause of death is still said to be undetermined, the attorney said.  The attorney criticized what she considered a delay on the part of US investigating agencies, saying they waited to investigate until after their own autopsy was conducted.  ""There was no swift action on this case. There was absolutely no urgency on the part of the US authorities,"" Sue-Ann Robinson added. ""If you wait 'till five months after someone committed a crime... they would have the opportunity and time and space to delete text messages if that's what they wanted to do, to talk to each other about the case,"" the attorney said. Federal officials said they do not normally issue public statements about the status of an investigation, but in this case, they felt it was necessary because of the public concern surrounding the case.  ""It is important to reassure the public that experienced federal agents and seasoned prosecutors extensively reviewed the available evidence and have concluded that federal charges cannot be pursued,"" the statement said. Prosecutors in Mexico said last year they were investigating Robinson's death as femicide, a crime defined as the ""intentional murder of women because they are women.""  In most countries, including the United States, femicide is not different from homicide in criminal law, but Mexico is among at least 16 countries that have included femicide as a specific crime. The family plans to hold a march to the State Department headquarters Washington, DC, on May 19, the 200th day since Shanquella Robinson's passing, according to the family's attorney. ""The message cannot be that US citizens can go overseas and commit crimes against other US citizens and come back and say that they're on base, that they're safe, that they're not gonna be arrested, that there's gonna to be such a delay in the investigation that the evidence will have time to dissipate,"" she said.

                      13-year-old leads California police on chase in stolen car and crashes, leaving 2 dead and nearly a dozen injured
                  ","
                      Two people were killed and nearly a dozen more were injured after a 13-year-old crashed into two other vehicles while leading police on a chase in a stolen car in California over the weekend, authorities said. One person died at the scene and a 4-year-old girl died Wednesday from her injuries, the Woodland Police Department said. An officer had spotted a vehicle being driven erratically on Saturday afternoon, according to a news release from the police department. Woodland is about 15 miles northwest of Sacramento. The officer tried to pull the vehicle over and a pursuit followed, Woodland police said. The car then collided with two other vehicles, causing two cars to catch fire. Police later determined the driver of the car involved in the pursuit was a 13-year-old boy in a stolen car. He was due to make his first court appearance Wednesday, police said. The 4-year-old who died had been one of 11 people injured in the crash, police said. The California Highway Patrol was investigating, police said.

                      Living standards are still falling in Japan. That's a recipe for more stagnation
                  ","
                      Japan's workers still aren't getting paid enough to keep up with rising prices. That's hurting living standards and creating a major headache for the country's new central bank chief as he marks his first week on the job. Adjusted for inflation, wages slipped 2.6% in February, compared to the same month a year earlier, according to government data released last week. That marked nearly a year -— 11 straight months — of declines despite a major campaign by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to hike compensation. Economists say the issue will likely continue to dog the Bank of Japan's new governor, Kazuo Ueda, who took the helm over the weekend and is facing pressure to do away with the ultra-loose monetary policy of his predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda. With inflation hitting 3.1% in February, above the central bank's 2% target, it should be time for the the BOJ to end its massive stimulus program. But, consumer prices are mainly being driven higher by rising import costs, rather than strong domestic demand. That means it'll be tough for Ueda to hike interest rates, especially as living standards aren't rising either. Ueda's predecessor was the main architect of aggressive, ""bazooka"" style stimulus measures intended to boost Japan's economy after decades of stagnation. Kuroda's signature ultra-easy monetary policy has been criticized for distorting markets, even as it succeeded in weakening the yen and boosting exports.  Any move to ditch it, though, could risk more problems, if conditions aren't right.  If Ueda tightens monetary policy before solid and steady growth is achieved, it would end up cooling demand and damaging the economy. That's why robust growth in wages must be established before the BOJ can start hiking rates, according to economists.  ""The stagnant wage rise will leave Ueda no choice but to maintain the short-term [interest] policy rate at effectively zero in the coming years,"" said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics. ""What he will do in the coming months is to simply make the super-easy policy more sustainable."" Prime Minister Kishida has been urging businesses to help workers keep up with higher living costs. The issue of stagnant wages could improve this year, as companies heed the call to raise salaries in response to inflation. Salary negotiations Last month, Rengo, the country's largest labor group, said more than 800 unions and their employers had reached preliminary agreements to increase wages by an average of 3.8%.  That would mark the highest rate of raises since 2013, the organization said. New payrolls are expected to kick in this month, which marks the beginning of the fiscal year. Economists say this may help. ""The wage hikes announced at spring wage negotiations so far are a good start, but it's too soon to say much about the macroeconomic impact,"" said Stefan Angrick, a Tokyo-based senior economist at Moody's Analytics. Like other parts of the world, inflation in Japan has become a headache. Angrick noted that core consumer prices, excluding fresh food, did tick down in February, from 4.2% the previous month to 3.1%, thanks to government support for household energy bills. That's low by comparison with America or Europe. But in Japan, it's high enough to feel uncomfortable, given stagnant wage growth, according to Angrick. He said although overall wage gains this year were expected to exceed those in previous years, the pay bumps are unlikely to be able to keep up with inflation.  A delicate balance The BOJ has deployed its ultra-easy policy since Kuroda, who completed his 10-year term over the weekend, took the reins in 2013. Then, in 2016, after years of aggressive bond buying failed to push up prices, it introduced the yield curve control (YCC) program, where it bought targeted amounts of bonds to push down yields, in order to stoke inflation and stimulate growth. As part of that program, the central bank targeted some short-term interest rates at an ultra-dovish minus 0.1% and aimed for 10-year government bond yields around 0%. But as prices rose and interest rates elsewhere went up, pressure has grown on the BOJ to wind down the program. ""The BOJ is caught between financial markets anticipating a policy pivot and the recognition that [a] premature exit would likely derail the economy and any hope of achieving the kind of sustained, demand-driven 2% inflation the bank is aiming for,"" said Angrick.  ""At the same time, consumer price inflation is still uncomfortably high. All of this requires careful maneuvering and communication."" In December, the BOJ shocked global markets by allowing the 10-year government bond yield to move 50 basis points on either side of its 0% target.  The move stoked speculation the central bank may follow the same direction as other major economies by allowing rates to rise further — and underscored how all eyes were on the bank over even the slightest adjustments.  — Juliana Liu, Laura He and Moeri Karasawa contributed to this report.

                      Uber is funding an e-bike trade-in program to curb battery fires
                  ","
                      Uber is funding a new program that aims to get electric bikes with dangerous non-certified lithium-ion batteries off New York City streets. The company said on Wednesday it will soon allow the thousands of New York City delivery workers who use e-bikes the ability to trade-in their bikes for newer, safer models. The news follows a string of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries, which have been known to overheat when charging and cause massive explosions.  Earlier this week, the New York City police department said an e-bike's lithium-ion battery was behind a fatal two-alarm fire in Queens. The FDNY's Chief fire marshal John Hodgens said it was the 59th fire in the city this year caused by a lithium-ion battery. Part of the issue is that not all lithium-ion batteries are created equal. UL-certified electric bikes and scooters come from reputable retailers and undergo extensive battery safety tests. But other online marketplaces, which some delivery workers may have turned to for more affordable options in the absence of company-provided options or subsidies, often make it hard to tell the origin of these products and the quality of their batteries.  To get more UL-certified e-bikes on roads, Uber is now partnering with e-bike company Zoomo to offer credit to delivery workers willing to swap their existing e-bikes for ones with higher-quality batteries. It will also offer rent-to-own pricing models and priority access to repairs and services.  Uber is also piloting a trade-in program with The Equitable Commute Project, a non-profit, to provide discounted UL-certified e-bikes in exchange for a ""noncompliant device."" ""Delivery workers should not have to choose between making a living and safety,"" said Josh Gold, Uber's senior director for public policy, in a statement. ""By providing discounts and exchange opportunities for new UL certified e-bikes and certified lithium-ion batteries, the expensive price tag that too often acts as a blocker to safety should no longer have to be a concern."" Steve Kerber, vice president and executive director of UL's Fire Safety Research Institute, previously told CNN the number of lithium-ion battery-based fires is growing with enormous frequency both in the United States and internationally, particularly when it comes to e-bikes and e-scooters. That's due to an uptick in purchases of these products during the pandemic. ""People started to get overcharged for them and turned to manufacturers which happened to have lower quality control with the battery systems,"" Kerber said. ""The quality manufacturers are not having issues."" Despite the concerns, lithium-ion batteries continue to be prevalent in today's most popular gadgets, from smartphones and laptops to e-bikes and scooters. Some tech companies point to their abilities to charge faster, last longer and pack more power into a lighter package.  But Dylan Khoo, an analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research, previously told CNN that electric bikes and scooters use batteries which can be around 50 times larger than the one in a smartphone. ""So when a fire does happen, it's much more dangerous,"" Khoo said. All lithium-ion batteries use flammable materials, and incidents are likely the result of ""thermal runaway,"" a chain reaction which can lead to a fire or catastrophic explosion, according to Khoo. ""This process can be triggered by a battery overheating, being punctured, or an electrical fault like a short circuit,"" Khoo said. ""In cases where fires occur spontaneously while charging, it is likely due to manufacturing defects."" Anyone with a lithium-ion battery should follow proper charging and battery usage guidelines, such as keeping them in a cool, dry place, and not leave it charging for too long or while you're asleep. Batteries should also be routinely inspected to make sure there is no cracking, bulging or leaking, and people should always use the charger that came with the device or use one from a reputable supplier, according to researchers at the University of Michigan.

                      JPMorgan ends remote work for senior bankers
                  ","
                      America's largest bank is ending pandemic-era hybrid work for its senior staff. ""Our leaders play a critical role in reinforcing our culture and running our businesses,"" JPMorgan Chase told staff in a memo. ""They have to be visible on the floor, they must meet with clients... and they should always be accessible for immediate feedback and impromptu meetings."" Wall Street giants like JPMorgan have been among the most vocal proponents of returning to a pre-pandemic office regimen. That was true even in the fall of 2020, before new Covid variants emerged and scuttled banks' back-to-office plans. But as infection rates have fallen, bosses across Corporate America have been itching to get their staffs back under one roof.  While there is still no standard way to measure the full extent of remote work, one report from Kastle Systems, which operates card-swipe security machines, said that the weekly average office occupancy rate at the end of March in the most populous U.S. cities was 49% of pre-pandemic levels.  JPMorgan said it would maintain hybrid working options for thousands of employees who are required to have three days in the office. In the memo, the bank issued a warning to staffers who are struggling to hit that minimum. ""There are a number of employees who aren't meeting their in-office attendance expectations, and that must change,"" the note reads, adding that managers would be responsible for taking ""corrective action"" if employees don't comply.  Another motivation for JPMorgan: A year ago, the bank unveiled a design for a new global headquarters in New York. The 60-story skyscraper was touted as the city's ""largest all-electric tower with net zero operational emissions."" When it opens in 2025, it'll have space for 14,000 employees and offer ample public green space along 49th Street and Park Avenue.

                      Inflation hits the mailbox: Postage stamp prices are rising, again
                  ","
                      Stamp prices are set to tick up. The US Postal Service said Monday that it filed a notice with its regulators to increase prices on first-class mail stamps to 66 cents from 63 cents. If approved, the change would take effect in July, raising the cost of mailing a first-class letter by about 5.4%. The Postal Service said the hike was necessary to offset a rise in operating expenses.  Surging prices have dented business across the global economy over the past two years, pushing up workers' wages and increasing the costs of doing business. Although inflation has been cooling over the past nine months — prices were up 5% last month on an annual basis — it remains above the central bank's target of around 2%. ""These price adjustments are needed to provide the Postal Service with much needed revenue,"" the agency said in a statement. If the latest hike is approved, it would amount to a 32% increase over the past four years. Domestic postcards will also increase from 48 cents to 51 cents, and international postcards from $1.45 to $1.50. It's rare, but not unheard of, for the regulators to decline USPS requests; they did so in 2010. The Postal Regulatory Commission denied a price hike because, according to its statement at the time, USPS ""failed both to quantify the impact of the recession on its finances and to show how its rate request relates to the resulting loss of mail volume."" First-class mail is becoming a smaller part of the Postal Service's business because of online communication. The number of individual letters sent each year has fallen by about half in the past decade. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, appointed during the Trump administration, has pursued sweeping changes during his tenure to try to bolster the agency's finances. USPS expects to lose $4.5 billion in 2023.

                      Warren Buffett wants harsher penalties for top leaders of failed banks
                  ","
                      Billionaire investor Warren Buffett isn't worried about the state of the US banking industry — but he would like to see much tougher consequences for top leaders of the banks that fail. In the wake of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett reflected on the public's frustration after the 2008 financial crisis. ""All kinds of trouble [was] caused by the banks. But bank executives ... they all continue to live fine. They may have lost their job, but they got their pensions,"" he said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC. ""There have got to be consequences to the people who make the decisions. Penalizing the shareholders later on by billions of dollars worth of fines ... that doesn't deter the bad action."" Specifically, Buffett thinks presidents and CEOs of failed banks should lose their retirement savings and that directors should have to return five years' worth of their lucrative salaries.  He admitted neither is likely to happen. ""That will not be met by great enthusiasm from a lot of friends of mine,"" he said. ""I don't know anybody that went back to flipping burgers at McDonald's or something, after they screwed up the system in a big way in 2008 and '09."" Still, he agrees with a number of banking experts who say the problems exposed over the last month following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank are nowhere near as bad as the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett also noted that customers of SVB and Signature Bank — a New York bank that failed shortly after SVB — don't have to worry about losing their money because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has guaranteed all deposits for those two banks — even those above the normal $250,000 limit. The FDIC's move was an extraordinary one, and Buffett said it gives him confidence about the state of the industry. It will be the banks, not US taxpayers, who will have to pay if the costs of bank failures rise, he added. Berkshire's bank sell-off The lack of penalties for bank leaders is one reason Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off most of its bank stocks, including some the company held for 30 years, he said. ""I just think the system isn't quite right in terms of connecting punishment to culprits on something that is so important,"" he said. Stiffer penalties would also help bolster both investors' and bank customers' confidence in the banking system, Buffett said, noting that ""there is no penalty attached to bad behavior and it does really, really affect the system when people lose confidence in banks."" As the fall of SVB showed, that confidence can be lost ""in seconds,"" Buffett said. ""We saw a country that was not worried about banks until about Wednesday or Thursday of the week when Silicon Valley [collapsed], and all of a sudden everybody was all worried about it [the banking system] all over the country."" Yet thanks to the FDIC, Buffett said, depositors don't need to worry. In fact, he said he would bet $1 million that no US bank depositors will lose money over the next year and invited someone else to put up $1 million that there will be losses — with the winner determining which charity would get the $2 million at the end of the year. Buffett also weighed in about the blame some place on Federal Reserve for the current banking crisis. Critics have slammed the lack of bank oversight and say the Fed raised interest rates so quickly that the Treasuries held by banks lost more value than banks expected. But Buffett has only praise for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. ""I do not think I could run the Fed as well as Jay Powell has done,"" Buffett said. ""He's been terrific.""

                  ","
                      The mother of the shooter who killed five people at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday called 911 after hearing secondhand that her son had a gun and was heading toward the bank, according to 911 calls released by police Wednesday. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh my Lord."" She said her son ""apparently left a note"" about the incident and she expressed her shock and confusion. ""He's never hurt anyone, he's a really good kid,"" she said. ""We don't even own guns. I don't know where he would have gotten a gun."" Follow live updates The call, which came in at 8:41 a.m. Monday, was one of a number of 911 calls released to the public Wednesday detailing the panic and fear during the mass shooting, in which the gunman, 25-year-old bank employee Connor Sturgeon, used a recently purchased AR-15-style rifle to shoot his coworkers and responding officers before he was shot dead by police. The attacker livestreamed the gruesome assault, which took place about 30 minutes before the bank was set to open, authorities said.  Five people were killed, and three remained hospitalized as of Tuesday, including Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie police officer who just graduated from the police academy 10 days earlier and was shot in the head. One 911 caller tells an operator an officer was down, having fallen right after their arrival. ""I just wanted to make sure you understood that there was an officer down,"" the man tells the operator, ""There are several officers here now, but the one hasn't moved since he's been shot. ... I haven't seen a foot or anything moving.""  The release of the files came just before officials in Louisville hosted a vigil to grieve the victims and as the gunman's family released a statement outlining his mental health challenges. Police on Tuesday also released dramatic police body camera footage showing the response to the shooting. The attack was just one of more than 145 shootings reported in the US this year with at least four people shot, excluding the shooter. Bank employee told 911 she saw shooting on video According to the audio files, the first caller to 911 came from a woman who works at a different branch of Old National Bank and witnessed the shooting on video. ""How do you know you have an active shooter on site?"" the operator asked. ""I just watched it. I just watched it on a Teams meeting. We were having a board meeting,"" she said. ""I saw somebody on the floor. We heard multiple shots and people started saying 'Oh my God,' and then he came into the board room."" Another caller, speaking in a whisper, said she works at the bank and is hiding in a closet. While on the line, several gunshots can be heard in the background. ""I know who it is,"" the caller said. ""He works with us."" Later an employee in the building asked 911 for a situation report.    ""We are on the fourth floor. We are trying to get the status of what's going on,"" the caller says, ""We're tucked under a desk right now."" The 911 operator calmly tells the caller to remain in place as police officers clear the building, saying, ""As far as my understanding, the shooter has been taken into custody. As far as my understanding, the scene is safe at the moment.""  Staff members were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the gunman opened fire, manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN on Tuesday. She said the massacre ""happened very quickly."" Buchheit-Sims attended the staff meeting virtually and watched in horror as gunfire exploded on her computer screen. ""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she told CNN. ""I don't know how else to say that."" Family says gunman had depression In a statement released Wednesday, the gunman's family laid out his mental health challenges but said they never saw any warnings signs of such an attack. ""While Connor, like many of his contemporaries, had mental health challenges which we, as a family, were actively addressing, there were never any warning signs or indications he was capable of this shocking act,"" Sturgeon's family said in a statement to CNN affiliate WDRB.  The family said it has many ""unanswered questions"" and is cooperating with the investigation. ""No words can express our sorrow, anguish, and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people, their families, and the entire Louisville community,"" the statement read.  ""We mourn their loss and that of our son, Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized by his senseless acts of violence and are deeply grateful for the bravery and heroism of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department."" A former high school classmate of Sturgeon's who knew him and his family well said he never saw any ""sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen."" ""This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,"" said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense. I can't believe it."" It's still unclear what provoked the shooter to go on the deadly rampage. Sturgeon legally purchased the AR-15-style rifle -- the choice weapon of many US mass shooters -- six days before the attack, police have said. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the US: no ""Red flag"" laws, no universal background checks, permitless concealed carry and no waiting period between buying a firearm and taking possession of it. Those relaxed gun laws, experts say, help explain why the state has a firearm death rate higher than the national average, according to the CDC. What the body camera footage shows On Tuesday, Louisville police released bodycam video and bystander footage showing the officers' response to the mass shooting. The public footage begins with a video from Officer Wilt, who drove up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. As Wilt ran toward the gunshots that officers faced upon arrival, he was shot in the head, police said. The released version of Wilt's footage cuts off before he is shot.  Galloway's body camera footage shows him taking fire and then scrambling down some stairs to a safe position behind a planter. He tells other officers he can't see the gunman but notes the gunman is shooting through windows in the front of the bank, the video shows. At some point, Galloway was also shot. The gunfire shattered the bank's lobby glass windows, giving officers a view of his location, Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said.  As other officers arrived on scene, Galloway shot and killed the gunman from the steps in front of the bank, the video shows. ""I think I got him down! I think he's down!"" Galloway said, the video shows. He then advanced toward the building and directed others to check on his fallen colleague. ""Suspect down. Get the officer!"" The bystander footage, also released by police, was recorded across the street from the bank. The video shows Galloway taking cover with his rifle raised and pointed toward the building as he tries to locate the gunman's position. The entire situation -- from when the gunman began firing his assault weapon to when he was killed by police -- lasted for about nine minutes, according to Louisville police Lt. Col. Aaron Cromwell.  Shooting happened in one minute, official says It took the assailant one minute to complete the bloodbath before he stopped and waited for police to arrive, according to footage of the massacre described by a city official to CNN. The shooter had livestreamed the gruesome attack on Instagram. The video has since been taken down. The Instagram video begins by showing an AR-15-style weapon, followed by a worker in the bank saying good morning to the gunman, the official said. The gunman then tried to shoot her in the back but failed because the safety was on and the weapon still needed to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loaded the weapon properly and took the safety off, he shot the worker in the back, the official said.  The assailant then continued his rampage, firing at workers while they tried to outrun him, the official said. The shooter did not go to other populated floors of the bank, the official said. Once the shooter finished firing, he sat in the lobby area that looks out onto the street, apparently waiting for police, the official said. Police arrived about a minute and half later, the official said. Sturgeon had interned at the bank for three summers and been employed there full-time for about two years, his LinkedIn profile showed. The assailant had been notified that he would be fired from the bank, a law enforcement source said Monday. However, the police chief told CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday there ""was no discussion about [the shooter] being terminated, and of course he wasn't fired,"" prior to the shooting. This article has been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.

                      A Red Cross Snoopy T-shirt is going viral. It's prompting more young people to donate blood
                  ","
                      If you're cool, you'll donate blood. That's the message being sent in the latest American Red Cross partnership with ""Peanuts."" Everyone who donates blood by April 23 will receive a T-shirt while supplies last, featuring Snoopy as his alter ego, Joe Cool, in front of the Red Cross logo with the caption ""Be cool. Give blood.""  Though the Red Cross has previously given out T-shirts tied to other partnerships to donors, this particular shirt has gone viral on TikTok, thus becoming a hot commodity. Copies of the design are already being sold on resale websites like Etsy and eBay. The impact has been significant. TikTok users posting about their efforts to get the Snoopy shirts are also unintentionally informing viewers about the blood donation process and sparking an uptick in blood donors, too. ""POV: you donated blood to get the red cross x snoopy shirt,"" wrote user j_diddy3 in their video chronicling their experience donating blood, which has been viewed over a million times. ""The American Red Cross really popped off with this one,"" wrote user Erin Lovett, who donated blood after seeing another Tik Tok user post about the shirt.  The Red Cross began offering the shirts on April 1. In the past, the organization relied heavily on blood drives at colleges and high schools to bolster blood donation among young people -- a custom that became difficult during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Darren Irby, executive director of national brand partnerships at the American Red Cross.  As the campaign closes its second week, Irby said social media engagement has turned into action. Blood donations have risen by more than 40% compared to the week before the ""Peanuts"" partnership, he said, and there's been a jump in first-time blood donors, too. ""The Red Cross is thrilled that through this partnership we are able to introduce folks to this lifesaving act,"" he told CNN.  Last year, the Red Cross, which supplies an estimated 40% of the country's blood supply, faced the worst blood shortage in more than a decade. Because blood cannot be stored for long periods of time, having a stable blood supply is important, so it can then be used for medical procedures like surgeries, cancer treatment and transfusions after traumatic injuries. But there has also been scrutiny over rules for who can donate blood in the US. Under current guidelines, gay and bisexual men are required to abstain from sex for three months before donating blood -- a rule the American Medical Association has called discriminatory.  In January, the US Food and Drug Administration proposed a change to those guidelines, which would eliminate the three-month waiting period while focusing on more individual risk assessments. That proposal has not yet been finalized.

                      Here is some background information about the deaths of 13 people at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, on April 20, 1999. Facts Twelve students and one teacher were killed by students Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18. The pair made home videos prior to the attack making references to what they were going to do and apologizing to their parents for it.  Harris and Klebold killed themselves with gunshot wounds to the head in the school's library at approximately 12:08 p.m. on the day of the shootings. SWAT teams entered the school 47 minutes after the shootings started. Five hours passed before law enforcement declared the school under control.  Victims Cassie Bernall, 17

                      Vietnam sentences political activist to 6 years in prison for anti-state activities
                  ","
                      A Hanoi court on Wednesday sentenced a prominent Vietnamese political activist to six years in prison for conducting anti-state activities, his lawyer said, in a case that has raised international concerns over the communist country's treatment of dissidents. Nguyen Lan Thang, 48, participated in environmental and anti-China protests, voiced support for other jailed activists, and wrote blogs about Vietnam's sociopolitical issues, according to his social media accounts. The police said last year they arrested Thang on charges of ""making, storing or distributing information, materials, documents to oppose the state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,"" without providing further details. Thang will also be placed under house arrest for two years after he serves his sentence, said his lawyer Le Van Luan after the closed-door trial session at the People's Court of Hanoi. Calls to the court went unanswered on Wednesday. Authorities have convicted at least 163 people since 2018 for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or association under ""vague or overbroad laws that criminalize protesting or criticizing the government,"" according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). ""Vietnam's authorities systematically trample on human rights by punishing brave bloggers like Nguyen Lan Thang for expressing their views about the government,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at HRW, which called for Thang's release and for charges against him to be dropped. A delegation of the European Parliament's Subcommittee of Human Rights during a visit to Hanoi last week expressed its ""great concern at the worsening human rights situation in the country."" ""The delegation called for immediate and unconditional release of all the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Vietnam, including NGO leaders, journalists and environmental activists,"" it said in a statement.

                      Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below. There have been more than 77,000 alleged war crimes registered by Ukraine, the country's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin told The Washington Post Wednesday. He said the alleged war crime incidents ""include not only murder, not only humiliation and rape, they also include the destroying of private property. They include forced deportation. They include forced detention of Ukrainians on occupied territories. They include looting on massive scale on the occupied territories and many other war crimes."" The chief prosecutor told the newspaper he has 305 alleged perpetrators ""who are notified of suspicion,"" along with 150 indictments ready and 30 convictions ""by Ukrainian courts with regard to Russian war criminals"" who committed alleged crimes on Ukrainian soil. He added that ""99-plus percent of all cases of war crimes committed against Ukrainians will be prosecuted and tried in Ukraine."" ""We are investigating war crimes in course of ongoing aggression,"" Kostin said to the Washington Post. ""We are not only investigating them, but also, we are making Russians accountable for the war crimes committed on Ukrainian soil."" According to Kostin, there are four elements contributing to the criminal accountability documented throughout the war in Ukraine: National efforts, assistance from the International Criminal Court, international coordination and the creation of a special international tribunal for the alleged ""crime of aggression.""  ""These four layers of criminal responsibility create full web of accountability on (a) criminal level for Russia and its perpetrators,"" Kostin told the Post.  Russia says its forces hit Ukrainian army reserves attempting to get into the battered city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. According to Russia's Ministry of Defense, Russian forces hit ""reserves of the enemy that tried to break into Bakhmut from the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Bohdanivka, as well as the units of the 28th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine close to Kostiantynivka."" On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials denied Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin's claim that Russian forces now control 80% of the city. Here are other headlines: Sanctions: The United Kingdom announced sanctions on a network of companies and individuals with financial links to Russian oligarch and ex-Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, as well as Alisher Usmanov. It said the move would would target those helping the pair to ""avoid the full cost"" of sanctions already imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States also imposed a large tranche of sanctions Wednesday on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to the war.  Beheading video responses: The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali said on Wednesday. The statement is in response to two videos released on social media in the past week that appear to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. Wagner private military company leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has denied that his fighters were involved in the grisly video. Leaked documents: A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. Electronic conscription bill: A new bill allowing for the electronic delivery of military draft papers is meant to fix a chaotic process of registration and enlistment, the Kremlin said Wednesday. The bill is designed to make the process “modern, efficient and convenient for citizens,” spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Russian officials have denied suggestions that the bill lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization. Evan Gershkovich: The US continues its public push for consular access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, as the top official handling hostage negotiation committed to bringing him home from Russia. Access to Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Military aid: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal repeated Ukraine’s requests for F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and longer-range missiles from the US directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in remarks at the top of their meeting at the Pentagon. Shmyhal also thanked the US for its continued military support during their meeting. Also, the Serbian government has denied it sold weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, after a report emerged claiming otherwise. ##Catch Up## Pentagon officials provided an unclassified briefing about the leaked classified information Wednesday afternoon for House leadership, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, according to three congressional sources familiar with the matter.   The 45-minute phone briefing was held by the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Defense and Security Ronald Moultrie, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Rheanne Wirkkala and Under Secretary for Policy Colin Kahl.  It was the first official briefing the lawmakers received on the topic, coming a week after the Defense Department was made aware of the leaked classified documents.  Senate leadership and the relevant Senate national security committees also received a briefing from the Biden administration on the leaked classified documents, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The briefers told the House and Senate committees that the Pentagon is looking for the source of the leak and that the Biden administration is trying to ease the concerns of nervous allies, according to another source familiar with the briefings. One source declined to provide details about what was said but told CNN that members learned very little, and some left the meeting feeling like there was a lack of urgency inside the administration over the leak. All senators will receive a briefing on the leaked documents on Wednesday afternoon next week, according to a Senate Democratic aide. A classified briefing for all House members is also expected next week, possibly on Wednesday, one of the sources said.  The European Union Delegation at the United Nations said those who are committing war crimes in Ukraine must be held accountable after a video appears to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. ""The EU supports investigations on all war crimes committed in Ukraine. We will work tirelessly to ensure accountability,"" the EU said on Twitter Wednesday. Some background: A video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, which appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Russian social media accounts said the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved.  CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. A second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began.   A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. As a NATO member, Turkey is broadly considered a partner nation to the US and other nations providing direct military support to Ukraine and it has publicly expressed opposition to Russia's invasion. It is also home to a major US military base where nuclear weapons are stored and act as an obvious warning sign to deter Russian aggression against NATO members.  Evidence that Turkey has discussed selling weapons to Russian mercenary forces would likely raise serious concerns in Washington and complicate Ankara's relationship with other NATO members. Not only does the document reference intelligence about Wagner seeking to purchase weapons from Turkey, it also states that the paramilitary group planned to resume recruitment of prisoners from Russia's jails.  According to the US signals intelligence reporting cited in the document, personnel from the Wagner Group met with ""Turkish contacts"" in early February with the intent ""to purchase weapons and equipment from Turkey"" that could then be used by Wagner mercenaries who are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Wagner also planned to use the weapons and equipment from Turkey in Mali, where the group maintains a significant presence, according to the leaked document. While there is no evidence that shows that Turkey has moved forward with any arms sales to the Wagner Group, details about the February meeting — outlined in a section of the leaked document titled, ""Mali, Russia, Turkey: Vagner seeks weapons from Ankara"" — suggest US officials believe the Russian mercenary outfit has at least tested the waters.  CNN has not independently confirmed the veracity of the document, but US officials have indicated that most of the leaked tranche are authentic. A State Department spokesperson said the ""the Department of Defense and the intelligence community are actively reviewing and assessing the validity"" of the leaked documents, adding ""we are not in a position to confirm or comment on any specific information they contain."" CNN has reached out to the US National Security Council, the office of the Turkish President and Turkey's Embassy in Washington for comment on the document. Read more here. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has secured a $200 million loan from the World Bank to help rebuild the country’s energy sector. “Today we signed the agreement with World Bank VP Anna Bjerde to provide an additional $200 million to restore power system in #Ukraine,” he tweeted Wednesday, after a meeting in Washington. “We are also preparing to implement a military risk insurance project for foreign investors.”  “Grateful for the support for Ukraine’s recovery,” he added. Shmyhal said Ukraine would begin rebuilding damaged areas this year. “The funds attracted from the World Bank will be used to rebuild the power grid and heat supply systems in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy and the cities of Chernihiv region,” he said, according to his office. “This winter, we have defeated Russia in the battle for light and are already preparing for the next heating season.” Access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. “Regarding the visit of Evan Gershkovich by representatives of the US Embassy in Moscow, we inform you that the issue is being considered and will be worked out in due time in accordance with consular practice and Russian law. The status assigned to him by the American authorities in this case does not matter,” said Zakharova in a statement published by the ministry Wednesday. Zakharova said the ""noise"" staged in the Western media around the detention of a journalist ""caught red-handed"" is ""an example of blatant hypocrisy."" ""It is kept silent that the American embassy in Moscow was notified in a timely manner about the detention of Evan Gershkovich. Our diplomats in similar cases, in violation of the bilateral consular convention, are informed either with a delay or not at all, especially in high-profile cases under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Justice and the FBI,"" she said. According to Zakharova, the calls by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials to its citizens to leave the Russian Federation are ""hypocritical,"" since it was Washington that launched ""the real hunt for Russians in the US and third countries."" “I emphasize that any attempts to put pressure on the Russian authorities and the courts, insisting on a 'special treatment' for US citizens who have broken the Russian law, are senseless and futile. It is time for Washington to learn that we will not tolerate interference in our internal affairs and will act exclusively in accordance with our national interests,"" Zakharova added. Some background: On Monday, the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich’s release. Reporting from CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States for its continued military support as he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Wednesday. ""Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States and the Secretary personally for their significant military support, as well as for their efforts to establish the Contact Group on Ukraine's Defense, which currently includes more than 50 countries,"" his office said in a readout of the meeting.  The pair discussed Ukraine’s further needs, with Shmyhal asking Austin to supply Ukraine with more weapons.  “Ukrainian soldiers have proven that they can master the latest equipment in a short time and use it effectively on the battlefield,” he said, according to his office. “For a quicker victory, Ukraine also needs more weapons: Air defense, heavy artillery and equipment, mortars and ammunition.” Wagner private military company founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin has called for the entire Russian society to be mobilized, saying people are ready to contribute to Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.  ""It is not only the mobilized who should be mobilized, those who go to the front, but all the society should be mobilized,” Prigozhin said in an audio posted on his Telegram channel, in reaction to Russia’s new electronic conscription bill. ""Starting from simple workers who are actually ready for this process."" “When we travel to the regions, our recruiters see that people are ready to be mobilized and understand that there is a war going on for the very existence of Russia,” he added. Unlike Prigozhin, the Russian government continues to deny it is waging a war in Ukraine, referring to the conflict as a ""special military operation."" The new bill put forward by the Kremlin, which is set to be signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, would tighten the rules for Russians drafted into the conflict to prevent them from leaving the country — as many did in droves during last year's ""partial mobilization."" The Wagner leader criticized Russian officials who fled the country with their wealth and said the whole ""system"" needs to be shaken.  ""Why don't we want to clean out this anthill that has been created over the years and which over the years has turned from a community of people who are ready to develop something in this country into a community of people who are only interested in their own well-being?"" he questioned. ""The system requires global sanitation and a reduction in the number of participants in this bureaucratic community."" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal repeated Ukraine’s requests for F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and longer-range missiles from the US directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in remarks at the top of their meeting at the Pentagon. “We will win this war,” said Shmyhal in English, “but to achieve it faster and with fewer casualties, Ukraine still needs intensive military support.” Austin did not comment on the specific requests, but did commit to expanding the production of military assets in the US for Ukraine. “We will keep investing in our own defense industrial base to further ramp up production,” said Austin. Austin also thanked Ukraine for its focus on accountability for the security assistance the US has already provided. “Let me commend you for the unprecedented level of transparency that Ukraine has provided to ensure our security assistance remains in the hands of Ukraine’s defenders,” said Austin. Austin ignored a question about the effect of the leaked classified documents from the Pentagon on Ukraine. More on jets: In March, Slovakia joined fellow NATO member Poland in pledging to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The White House had said that Poland’s decision to send the fighter jets is a ""sovereign decision"" that won’t spur US President Joe Biden to send F-16 aircraft. The United States imposed a large tranche of sanctions on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Wednesday’s sanctions are the latest action meant to diminish Moscow’s abilities in its war in Ukraine and punish those who are supporting it, including through helping Russia to evade existing sanctions. Sanctions on Russian billionaire and associates: The latest sanctions target a wide network tied to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who is already under sanction in multiple countries, and were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom. According to the US Treasury Department, Usmanov ""is one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires"" who ""holds significant interests in the metals and mining, telecommunications, and information technology sectors.""  He is ""known to be close to multiple U.S.-designated, senior Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Dmitry Medvedev, current Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former President and Prime Minister of Russia,"" according to a statement.   Sanctions on international companies and a bank: The US also imposed sanctions on companies based in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, which the US Treasury Department said is supporting Russia’s military industrial complex in defiance of existing sanctions.  The Treasury also sanctioned the International Investment Bank, ""a Russia-controlled financial institution"" in Budapest, as well as its Moscow-based subsidiary and several former and current executives.  ""The IIB’s presence in Budapest enables Russia to increase its intelligence presence in Europe, opens the door for the Kremlin’s malign influence activities in Central Europe and the Western Balkans, and could serve as a mechanism for corruption and illicit finance, including sanctions violations,” according to the Treasury Department.  Sanctions on organizations that target children: In addition, the US State Department is sanctioning two Russian entities ""that support Russia’s efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine through the militarization and indoctrination of schoolchildren: The All Russian Children's And Youth Military Patriotic Public Movement Youth Army, and the State Budgetary Educational Institution of Additional Education of the Republic of Crimea Crimea Patriot Center,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.  According to the State Department, the so-called youth army was created by Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and is ""responsible for militarizing and propagandizing schoolchildren in occupied areas of Ukraine."" 
            The ""Crimea Patriot Center"" is ""an organization whose objective is to provide youth with a ‘military-patriotic education’ in order to prepare them for service in the Russia’s Armed Forces,"" it said.  The Serbian government has denied it sold weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, after a report emerged claiming otherwise.  ""Serbia has not and will not sell weapons to either Ukraine or Russia,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Milos Vucevic said in a statement Wednesday. ""We have rejected those allegations more than ten times, and we will do it again."" Vucevic was responding to a Reuters report that claimed a leaked Pentagon document names Serbia as having sent or is planning to send lethal aid to Ukraine.  ""Someone obviously aims to drag Serbia into that conflict, but we adhere to our policy consistently,"" Vucevic said. ""There is always the possibility that some weapons might mysteriously appear on the territory where there is a conflict, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Serbia. That is a question for the countries that do not conform to international norms or terms of business agreements,"" he added.�� More about the documents: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. The highly classified Pentagon documents have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post.  Ukrainian and Spanish defense ministers have denied claims that NATO troops are fighting against Russian armed forces in Ukraine, refuting allegations that emerged from a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents.  “It is totally false that there are NATO troops in Ukraine,” Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said Wednesday at a joint news conference in Madrid with her visiting Ukrainian counterpart.  “It’s not true that there are NATO personnel in Ukraine,” with the exception of military attachés, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said. Responding to a question about the document leak, Reznikov said it ""has a lot of data that’s not true (and) is no longer current. The beneficiary of this operation is Russia or its allies or sympathizers,"" adding that he is confident that Ukraine’s US allies will work to ""neutralize this leak and avoid this in the future.""  Ukraine has ""full confidence in our in our American allies"" in spite of the leak, he said. From Spain’s perspective, Robles said the unity of NATO and European Union allies remains strong and Russia will ""not achieve a break in that.""  Update on tanks: Robles said Spain’s first shipment of six modern battle tanks for Ukraine will leave soon via ship and should arrive in the war-torn country by the end of this month. Along with these six Leopard 2A4 tanks, Spain will also send 20 armored vehicles, she added. Spain will later send four more of the Leopard tanks ""as soon as possible,"" after they are repaired. Reznikov said Ukraine asked Spain for air defense systems, including combat jets, artillery rounds, and for training and technical advice in amphibious military operations, including undersea mine removal. The Ukrainian defense minister said he would meet with executives of Spanish arms makers on this visit. He and the Spanish defense minister were also expected to tour a military hospital in Madrid treating Ukrainian troops severely wounded in combat, including those whose limbs have been amputated.   Russian officials have denied suggestions that a bill to allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters it is meant only to ""fix the mess"" that followed September’s controversial partial mobilization order, which was beset by issues and prompted thousands of Russians to flee. But the strict new rules make it more difficult for Russian men to avoid an order should it be made, and Russians told CNN of their concerns about the plan. ""Now it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become,"" Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN.  While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to their own guidelines when calling up recruits. ""I have no illusions with regard to the assurances of authorities who insist these amendments were passed exclusively to improve the draft’s bookkeeping and have nothing to do with the second mobilization wave,"" he said. ""I don’t believe a word of this."" ""I believe the mobilization has never ended. It has begun and continues to the day,"" he added. ""You can look at this development as preparation of the state to step up mobilization. To make it possible to notify and mobilize large number of conscripts in a short period of time."" The bill passed through its third reading in the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament Tuesday, and was approved by the upper chamber, the Federation Council on Wednesday. Its final formality is to be signed into law by Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN also spoke to Olga, a 48-year-old woman who fears her son, who is 16, will be sent to fight in the coming years, disrupting his plans for higher education. ""I feel very badly about this war. And same goes for all other wars and any deaths by force regardless of the cause,"" she said. ""I would prefer for wars to be fought only by professional military or volunteers."" “Should (the war) drag on and intensify, and if there is a real second wave of mobilization, then I think some will try to leave (Russia), of course,"" she added.

According to the ministry, Russian forces hit ""reserves of the enemy that tried to break into Bakhmut from the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Bohdanivka, as well as the units of the 28th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine close to Kostiantynivka."" The ministry also said Wagner private military company fighters had captured three more blocks in their attempt to seize control of the embattled city. CNN cannot independently verify these claims.  What Ukraine says: On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials denied Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin's claim that Russian forces now control 80% of the city. ""I've just been in touch with the commander of one of the brigades that are defending the city. I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut,"" Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told CNN on Tuesday. Western officials have conceded Russia had been able to make some progress in Bakhmut, but added it could be ""measured in meters."" Wagner private military company leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has denied that his fighters were involved in a grisly video that purportedly shows Ukrainian soldiers who have been beheaded. “I have watched this video. It’s bad when people’s heads are cut off, but I haven’t found anything to support that this is happening near Bakhmut and that Wagner fighters are participating in the execution,"" he said in a statement published by his company Wednesday. Prigozhin was responding to a question about a video that was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, which appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. A second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Andy Carey, Josh Pennington and Yulia Kesaieva contributed reporting to this post.  The US continues its public push for consular access to Evan Gershkovich as the top official handling hostage negotiation committed to bringing the detained Wall Street Journal reporter home from Russia.  “The Russians owe us a consular visit. We have yet to have consular access to Mr. Gershkovich,” US special envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens told “CNN This Morning.”  Asked if a prisoner swap is on the table, Carstens said that the US is committed to bringing Gershkovich and others who are wrongfully detained home and that US President Joe Biden would do “whatever it takes to get that job done” and is willing to make “hard decisions.” “The President of the United States and the Secretary are committed to bringing Evan home and Paul Whelan as well. And we're gonna find whatever it takes to get that job done. We’re not going into the specifics of the pathways of negotiation. To my mind that might decrease our chances to garner that release, but I can tell you that the President’s shown time and time again that he's committed, he's willing to make the hard decisions to find ways to bring Americans home,” he said.  Now that Gershkovich has been formally designated by the State Department as wrongfully detained, Carstens said it “by force of law obligates the United States of America to seek a wrongfully detained American’s release. And that's what we're doing right now. My office is working closely with the National Security Council at the White House to find those paths that will bring Evan home.”  More on Americans detained in Russia: Carstens said he spoke with Paul Whelan for about 15 minutes on Monday and they spoke “about Evan’s case.” “Paul’s spirits are still good. He's still remaining strong. He's still resilient. Small known fact — I mean, he sings the National Anthem every day from his prison cell, and he's ready to come home and we're going to find a way to bring him home,” he said, adding that his office does not prioritize cases and both Whelan and Gershkovich, along with the 30-40 cases currently being handled by his office are “treated equally.” Carstens noted that there have been conversations between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as well as discussions between US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy and her counterparts. “We've been pressing them for Evan’s release, we've been pressing them for consular access, and anything beyond that I'd rather not talk about. I want to maintain some of our negotiation space,” Carstens said, adding, “We’re going to find a way to bring Evan and Paul Whelan home.” The upper chamber of Russia’s parliament, the Federation Council, has voted in favor of the electronic delivery of military call-up papers, which critics say will make it more difficult for Russians to evade conscription. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Once the bill becomes law, a person will be considered notified even if they have not seen the call-up papers or email. The call-up papers will be deemed to be served once they appear on a government portal called Gosuslugi — the main online platform for state services in Russia, such as making a doctor’s appointment, requesting a passport or registering for marriage.  Previously, conscription documents in Russia had to be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer.  Those liable for military service will be banned from traveling abroad, the proposed legislation published on the government’s website said. Draft dodgers will receive a travel ban from the day when the summons is considered to have been ""handed"" to them, in accordance with the law.  People who fail to show up for a military summons without a valid reason within 20 days will face restrictions, such as being unable to register a vehicle and drive it, being unable to register an apartment, being unable to register as an individual entrepreneur or as self-employed, and be blocked from getting a loan. Paper and electronic summonses will have equal legal force, Andrey Kartapolov, head of the State Duma Committee on Defense, said to the RBC TV channel. According to Kartapolov, the introduced changes apply to all those liable for military service and not just to conscripts, he told state news agency TASS. Russia’s Defense Ministry routinely conscripts men for compulsory military service twice per year, in spring and autumn. The spring conscription this year will apply to 147,000 citizens between the ages of 18 and 27, and will take place from April 1 to July 15, according to an official document published by the government. More context: The Kremlin has consistently denied rumors of a possible second wave of mobilization in Russia. Its “partial mobilization” last year for its invasion of Ukraine resulted in a significant number of citizens fleeing Russia. Conscription involves the selection and enlistment of young men into the military, while mobilization refers to the larger-scale process of calling up reservists and other military personnel in the event of an emergency or war.   The UK has announced sanctions on a network of companies and individuals with financial links to Russian oligarch and ex-Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, as well as oligarch Alisher Usmanov. It said the move would target those helping the pair to “avoid the full cost” of sanctions already imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  “We are closing the net on the Russian elite and those who try to help them hide their money for war,” UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement.  “There’s no place to hide. We will keep cutting them off from assets they thought were successfully hidden. Together with our international partners the UK will continue to crack down on those who are supporting the war. We won’t stop until Putin does.” Among those sanctioned are Demetris Ioannides and Christodoulos Vassiliades, whom the statement described as “two Cypriot professional enablers” of Abramovich and Usmanov. Companies which the Foreign Office said were part of Usmanov’s financial network were also sanctioned, including USM, Curzon Square and Hanley Limited, according to the statement.  Several family members of other Russian oligarchs who it said were “used as proxies to hide their assets” were also sanctioned, according to the statement.  The assets of Usmanov and Abramovich were frozen by the UK government shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  A new bill allowing for the electronic delivery of military draft papers is meant to fix a chaotic process of registration and enlistment, the Kremlin said Wednesday.  “We must be aware that we must regulate the system of military registration and conscription. According to the Constitution, conscripts must serve in the army. This is a constitutional duty of citizens. When the special military operation began, we saw that in some places we had a lot of chaos in the military registration and enlistment offices,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told press on a Wednesday conference call.  The bill is designed to “fix the mess” and make the process “modern, efficient and convenient for citizens,” he said.  Russian officials have denied suggestions that the bill lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization, after a chaotic order in September prompted scores of Russians to flee the country.  But the measure will make it harder for Russians to evade conscription. On Tuesday, the State Duma -- the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament -- voted in favor of allowing electronic delivery of military call-up papers in addition to traditional letters. The upper chamber, the Federation Council, approved the bill on Wednesday. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Putin is “aware” of the legislation and will “read the document” before signing it, Peskov added.  He also said the bill was passed through in “accordance with the procedure provided for in the State Duma,” and questions regarding the speed in which the bill passed should be addressed to Parliament. The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said on Wednesday. “The EU reiterates its firm commitment to holding to account all perpetrators and accomplices of war crimes committed in connection with Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,” Massrali said.  The statement is in response to two videos released on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. “If confirmed, this is yet another brutal reminder about the inhumane nature of the Russian aggression,” Maasrali said. “Killing prisoners of war is a very serious breach of the Geneva convention and demonstrates once more Russia’s complete disregard of international law, in particular, international humanitarian law.”  A video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier has sparked widespread outrage and a war crimes investigation by Ukraine's security services. Elsewhere, authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea have canceled planned Victory Day parades citing security concerns. Here are the latest headlines: Beheading video sparks war crimes investigation: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a war crimes investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier, and President Volodymyr Zelensky called for those involved to be punished. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers,"" he said.
            Kremlin calls for video to be verified: Video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is “terrible,” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of it, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. 
            Russia speaks out on Gershkovich: Russia will not tolerate attempts by the US to “pressure” it over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday. Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The US State Department has designated him as being wrongfully detained.
            Russia cancels parades: Authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled parades and marches to celebrate Victory Day on May 9,  as well as May Day (May 1), citing security reasons. The two dates are public holidays in Russia, with May 9 marking Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. 
            Ukraine requests aid from India: Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova has requested more medicine and medical equipment from India, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. Dzhaparova also “proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies.""
            EU condemns Russia over civil society forum: The European Union strongly condemns the decision of Russian authorities to declare the activities of EU-Russia Civil Society Forum ""undesirable."" The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Tuesday had effectively shut down the Berlin-based organization which hosts intergovernmental conferences and civil society events. ##Catch Up## A Ukrainian defense ministry official has appealed for people to stop sharing video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier.  “We urge to stop the sharing of this video, as well as any similar video footage,"" said Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar.  ""Now after everyone has seen it, prosecutors and the International Court should watch it.” Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week: One purports to show the execution of a captured Ukrainian solider, and a second purports to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground. “From the first moments after the video of the execution of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian inhumans appeared, all competent Ukrainian services have been carefully studying it frame by frame in order to identify the war criminals,"" said Maliar on Telegram. “Tonight, we were doing just that together with other law enforcement agencies and special services,"" she added. Maliar also appealed to the public to refrain from guessing the identity of the soldier in the apparent execution video, saying authorities “are doing everything to identify the deceased.” The United Nations says it is “appalled by particularly gruesome videos posted on social media” -- one of which purports to show the execution of a captured Ukrainian solider, and a second which purports to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground. In a short statement, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, part of the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), says the apparent executions are “not an isolated incident.” “In recent reports the Mission documented a number of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including those committed against prisoners of war. The latest incidents must also be properly investigated, and the perpetrators must be held accountable,” the statement said. On March 24, the UN said it has documented dozens of cases of summary executions of prisoners of war (POWs) carried out by both Russian and Ukrainian forces since February 2022, but admits it is far harder to get information from Russia, or territories under Russian control, than it is from Ukrainian authorities. The OHCHR said it has documented the summary execution of 15 Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces, in addition to the use of Ukrainian POWs as human shields, the death of two wounded POWs due to lack of medical care, as well as torture.  On the other side, the report says it has documented -- through open-source information, in situ visits and witness interviews -- the summary execution of at least 25 Russian POWs being held by Ukrainian forces.  Video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is “terrible,” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of it, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “Of course, these are terrible shots. Then it may be a reason to check whether this is true or not, whether this took place and, if so, where and from which side,"" Peskov said during a regular call with journalists on Wednesday. Two videos purporting to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers have emerged on social media in the past week. Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the perpetrators to be punished. “There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,” he said. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,” Zelensky added. Video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is Russian propaganda and “an illegal execution by terrorists, by the occupying state,"" a Ukrainian official said Wednesday. “We are now conducting a detailed check of the content, the location, and who it is,"" Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, told national TV.  “This is another blatant fact of violation of all possible rules and norms of warfare. I am not even mentioning the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law,” he added. “This is a fact that the world must pay attention to -- not only with sympathy or indignation, but by working together to bring all those responsible to justice.” Yusov said the publication of the video is evidence “that such a genocidal policy, such a war crimes policy, is a state policy”. “Propaganda in Russia is centralized. There is a periodic posting of such videos of atrocities by the Russian military, we recently saw the execution of a Ukrainian soldier for the slogan ‘Glory to Ukraine,’ in general, once a month, once every few weeks, such content appears,"" he added.  “This is a deliberate state policy of the Russian Federation to cover the atrocities of its army against the Ukrainians, against Ukrainian military,” said Yusov. He said the goal of the policy is “undoubtedly an attempt to demoralize and sow panic among the Ukrainian defense and security forces, which they are failing at”. “Also, the purpose of such public atrocities, torture and executions is, in particular, to intimidate their soldiers.”    Two videos purporting to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers have emerged on social media in the past week.                                   Russia will not tolerate attempts by the US to “pressure” it over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.  Ryabkov told journalists Russia was considering allowing US diplomats consular access to Gershkovich, adding that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was in working contact with the US embassy.  “On this issue we are acting in full compliance with our laws, naturally taking into account the provisions of the consular convention and are guided by available precedent in this area,"" said Ryabkov. ""Therefore, we reject any attempts to pressure us.”  Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The US State Department has designated him as being wrongfully detained, Next week a Moscow court will hear an appeal filed by Gershkovich's lawyers against the decision that he should be held in the notorious Lefortovo pre-detention center until May 29, according to state media outlet RIA Novosti.  Ryabkov also said that the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks could be fake and deliberately planted with the aim of misleading Russia, according to TASS. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a war crimes investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier, it announced Wednesday. “Yesterday, a video was posted online of the Russian occupiers showing their beast side by brutally torturing a Ukrainian prisoner and cutting off his head,” the SBU said in a statement on Telegram. “The Security Service of Ukraine launched a pre-trial investigation into this war crime under Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine,” the SBU said. ""We will find these inhumans. If necessary, we will get them wherever they are: from under the ground or from the other side. But they will definitely be punished for their actions,"" SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk added. The video seen by CNN, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground.  It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. The video was one of two purportedly showing beheaded Ukrainian soldiers that have emerged on social media in the past week. The other may have been filmed more recently. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Russia “worse than ISIS” and said it is “absurd” that the country is currently presiding over the UN Security Council. “Russian terrorists must be kicked out of Ukraine and the UN and be held accountable for their crimes,” he said on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, tweeted: “Russian soldier is recorded enjoying cutting off head of Ukrainian war prisoner. Proving their beast nature and convincing world of RF's [Russian Federation’s] bloodthirstiness once again.” “There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said in response to a social media video that purportedly shows the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,” he said in a video message on Wednesday. Two videos have emerged in the past week that purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. Dariia Zarivna, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement Wednesday that the videos are ""aimed at intimidation."" “It completely dehumanizes and demonstrates the essence of a terrorist country,” she said of the videos. “But it is important to understand the purpose. This is an PSYOP [psychological operation] aimed at intimidation. The target audience is not only Ukraine, but also Western societies,” she said. “It doesn't work on us, though. The Russians are afraid of this, but not us,” she added. The videos appear to be of separate events -- one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The second video was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier.  A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova has requested more medicine and medical equipment from India, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. Dzhaparova concluded a three-day visit to India on Wednesday, where she met with Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi. In a statement issued by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) following her visit, Dzhaparova also “proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies."" According to the MEA, she “handed over a letter from President Zelensky, addressed to Prime Minister Modi,"" but the ministry didn't provide further details about the letter. The MEA also announced that the next session of the Inter-Governmental Commission, a group focused on trade and bilateral cooperation between the two countries, will be held in India.  In contrast, the next round of Foreign Office Consultations, which focus on diplomatic ties between the two countries, will take place in Kyiv. The dates for both meetings are yet to be decided. The European Union strongly condemns the decision of Russian authorities to declare the activities of EU-Russia Civil Society Forum as ""undesirable,"" according to a statement from the European Union External Action (EEAS) on Wednesday.  The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Tuesday had effectively shut down the Berlin-based organization which hosts intergovernmental conferences and civil society events. ""Civil society cooperation beyond borders and people-to-people contacts can only be desirable. However, under the current circumstances, we do not have any other choice than to discontinue cooperation with our partners from Russia,"" the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum said on LinkedIn as its webpage has now gone offline. This decision further intensifies the crackdown on independent civil society and media in Russia, taking place against the backdrop of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EEAS said in its statement. The European Union urges the Russian authorities to repeal the current legislation on the so-called “undesirable organizations” and “foreign agents”, which severely restricts the freedoms of association and opinion, the statement added. ""The European Union stands in solidarity with Russian citizens who are prevented from exercising their human rights. We will continue to support the important work of Russian civil society organizations, human rights defenders and independent media and journalists inside and outside Russia,"" it added. Authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled parades and marches to celebrate Victory Day on May 9 and May Day (May 1) citing security reasons. The two dates are public holidays in Russia, with May 9 marking Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.   ""The authorities of the Republic of Crimea and the city-hero of Sevastopol made a joint decision not to hold festive demonstrations on May 1, the ‘Immortal Regiment’ marches and the military parade on May 9. This decision is due to security reasons,"" the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea Sergey Aksenov said on Telegram. ""Despite the cancellation of festive events, our veterans will not be left without attention,"" he added.  Aksenov noted that representatives of local authorities will visit veterans and congratulate them on Victory Day. The situation in Crimea: While any Ukrainian offensive to reclaim Crimea is at best distant, the Russians are taking no chances.  As CNN reported last month, Russia is going to great lengths to fortify the peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014.  The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, has been carrying out attacks in Crimea with two goals: harass the Russian Black Sea fleet and disrupt vital Russian supply lines. Few details emerge about Ukrainian strikes in Crimea. Only occasionally does unofficial social media video provide clues about what has been hit. And only occasionally do normally circumspect Ukrainian officials refer to any actions in Crimea. Previous reporting  from CNN's Tim Lister Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. The videos appear to be of separate events – one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker’s identification. “(The armoured vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,” the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.”  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. Shortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: “There will be an accountability for everything.” Read more here. The highly classified leaked Pentagon documents posted to social media offer a pessimistic US view of the war's progress in Ukraine.  The documents highlight flaws in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses and predict a stalemate in the war for months to come. The documents, which appear to date from February and March, detail many of Ukraine's perceived military shortfalls as Kyiv prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  Several of the classified documents warn Ukraine's medium-range air defenses to protect front-line troops will be ""completely reduced by May 23,"" suggesting Russia could soon have aerial superiority and Ukraine could lose the ability to amass ground forces in a counteroffensive.  The documents also underscore lingering problems with Russia's own military offensive, predicting that the result will be a stalemate between the two sides for the foreseeable future. Officials familiar with the situation tell CNN the documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing deck prepared for the Pentagon's senior leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.  The leaking of the documents — many of which are marked top secret — represents a major national security breach, and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security.  In addition to the assessment of the Ukraine war, the documents include intelligence gathered on allies and adversaries alike. Here are the latest headlines:  UN says nearly 8,500 civilian deaths confirmed in Ukraine since invasion: The  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine. between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration. 
            Ukraine's top national security official downplays leaked intelligence documents: Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to Oleksii Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council. ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod, of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov.
            Americans detained by Russia: Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with the parents of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal correspondent detained in Russia, Tuesday. It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist.
            Russia conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile: Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the Defense Ministry reports.  Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the Defense Ministry reports.  ""On April 11, 2023, a Strategic Missile Forces combat crew conducted a successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Kapustin Yar state central joint forces test range in the Astrakhan region,"" the statement said. The launch helped confirm the correctness of schematic and structural and technical solutions used in developing new strategic missile systems, the Defense Ministry said. The missile's test warhead hit the target at the Sary Shagan firing range (Republic of Kazakhstan) with the target accuracy, according to the statement.  “The objectives of the launch were fulfilled in full,"" the statement read.  Back in February, Russia carried out a test of an ICBM that appears to have failed around the time President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that ""such testing is routine."" Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s failure to grant consular access to wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich “puts it, once again, in violation of international commitments it’s made."" “I think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access, never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes, is going to do even more damage to Russia's standing around the world — a standing that has been in free-fall, particularly since its rei-nvasion of Ukraine last year,” Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. “I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there, lest they be arbitrarily detained,” he said. Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist. Blinken did say what measures are being taken to free Gershkovich, only saying that the US is “engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan’s release.”

                      US inflation falls to lowest level since May 2021
                  ","
                      Prices are moving in a more palatable direction for US consumers.  Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, dropped in March for the ninth consecutive month. And for the first time since September 2020, grocery prices fell on a monthly basis. Prices rose 5% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 6% in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. Annual CPI plunged to its lowest rate since May 2021, helped by year-over-year comparisons to a period when food and energy prices spiked amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Still, CPI showed some cooling on a monthly basis. The index, which measures price changes over time for a basket of goods, ticked up 0.1% from February, as compared to a previous 0.4% increase.  Shelter costs, which tend to reflect lagging data, were the largest contributor of the monthly gain, offsetting sharp declines across energy categories, according to the BLS. The food at home index dropped 0.3% for the month, helped by lower prices for eggs (which fell nearly 11%) and fruits and vegetables (which declined 1.3%). The broader food category was unchanged (0%) for the first time since November 2020. Economists were expecting an annual increase of 5.2% and a monthly gain of 0.2%, according to Refinitiv. ""It's a good print, but it's not the end of the game, it's not the end of the story,"" Erik Lundh, principal economist at the Conference Board, told CNN. ""There's more to come — hopefully, knock on wood — and we're heading in the right direction."" Stripping out the often-volatile components of food and energy, core CPI grew 0.4% for the month, resulting in a 5.6% annual growth rate. In February, core CPI accelerated 0.5% month on month and 5.5% year over year. ""On the surface, price pressures are lessening. But when the box is opened, [core inflation] accelerated to the highest rate since May 2021,"" economist Sung Won Sohn, president of SS Economics and Loyola Marymount University professor, said in a statement. ""This is well over the 2% target set by the central bank."" He added: ""More hikes in the interest rate are coming."" CPI is one of the major inflation gauges that's being watched like a hawk by the Federal Reserve, which is in the throes of a yearlong campaign to battle inflation through monetary tightening and stark interest rate hikes.  Base effects in play The 1 percentage point drop in headline CPI is the largest downward swing seen in more than eight years; however, that feat was accomplished largely due to last year's inflation spike. ""Inflation really started to take off last spring and through June,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNN. ""And so things are going to feel a lot better here in the next few months because of those base effects."" Because month-to-month changes can be volatile, even in spite of seasonal adjustments, year-over-year comparisons typically can help smooth out some of that jumpiness.  But times have been anything but typical for the past three years. So, for the months ahead, moving averages become all the more critical to observe, Lundh said.  While the picture is more clear for the trajectory of headline CPI, it's a little more opaque for core and ""supercore"" activity (core services, excluding housing), Zandi said.  The base effects are much less pronounced for core CPI, because the spring and summer inflation spike was driven by food, energy and goods prices. ""Core inflation is remaining more persistent,"" he said. ""I expect improvement really toward the middle and second half of the year when the cost of housing services really begins to slow."" Shelter costs, as measured in the CPI, tend to lag more than other categories as the BLS collects rent data every six months and most rents don't change too frequently. Private-sector data shows that apartment rents have fallen in recent months, suggesting an eventual cooldown in shelter prices will show up in the CPI. Stripping out housing, however, still leaves a ""supercore"" inflation measurement that has remained stubbornly high. ""Supercore correlates with wages; thus, the Fed would be looking at some relief in this metric as a sign of slower wage gains,"" Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, said in a statement. ""Today's report shows the supercore decelerated in March, but it remains a sticky component of inflation, running around +4% annualized on a three- and six-month basis.""   ""This is too fast and a sign that the labor market remains offsides,"" he added. More Fed rate hikes still on the horizon The March CPI trajectory doesn't take another rate hike off the table, Lundh said.  ""There was some encouraging news in the inflation data today, but I don't think it's sufficient to cause the Fed to pause,"" he said. ""So we're expecting to see a [quarter-point] hike in the May meeting and even potentially another hike following that.""  The Fed's fight grew more complex in March with the collapse of two regional US banks, which then caused turmoil in the financial industry. The Fed, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to shore up depositors and prevent future bank runs. However, there are expectations that the turmoil could mean future credit tightening, which in turn could dampen demand and even help the Fed in its inflation-fighting goals. However, it could also create more uncertainty about a future recession. ""The CPI is backwards looking and the Fed still has to consider how much of a credit crunch to factor into the economy,"" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management, in a statement. While inflation has moderated since reaching a decades-high level last summer, the pace has been slower than anticipated as a strong labor labor market and resilient consumer spending has continued to fuel economic growth.

                      Who says romance is dead? Couples are using ChatGPT to write their wedding vows
                  ","
                      When Elyse Nguyen was nearing her wedding date in February and still hadn't started writing her vows, a friend suggested she try a new source of inspiration: ChatGPT.  The AI chatbot, which was released publicly in late November, can generate compelling written responses to user prompts and offers the promise of helping people get over writer's block, whether it be for an essay, an email, or an emotional speech. ""At first we inputted the prompt as a joke and the output was pretty cheesy with personal references to me and my husband,"" said Nguyen, a financial analyst at Qualcomm. ""But the essence of what vows should incorporate was there -- our promises to each other and structure."" She made edits, changed the prompts to add humor and details about her partner's interests, and added some personal touches. Nguyen ultimately ended up using a good portion of ChatGPT's suggestions and said her husband was on board with it.  ""It helped alleviate some stress because I had no prior experience with wedding vows nor did I know what should be included,"" Nguyen said. ""Plus, ChatGPT is a genius with alliteration, analogies and metaphors. Having something like, 'I promise to be your partner in life with the enthusiasm of a golfer's first hole in one' in my back pocket was comical."" Nearly five months after ChatGPT went viral and ignited a new AI arms race in Silicon Valley, more couples are looking to it for help with wedding planning, including writing vows and speeches, drafting religious marriage contracts, and setting up websites for the special day. Ellen Le recently created some of her wedding website through a new Writer's Block Assistant tool on online wedding planning service Joy, which was one of the first third-party platforms to incorporate ChatGPT's technology. (Last month, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, opened up access to the chatbot, paving the way for it to be integrated into numerous apps and services.) Le, a product manager at a startup, said she used the feature to draft an ""about us"" page and write directions from San Francisco to her Napa Valley wedding. The Writer's Block Assistant tool helps users write vows, best man and maid of honor speeches, thank you cards and wedding website ""about us"" pages. It also lets users highlight personal stories and select the style or tone before pulling it into a speech.  ""I started drafting my vows and when I typed in how we met, it produced this very delightful story,"" Le said. ""Some of it was inaccurate, making up certain details, but it gave me a helping hand and something to react to, rather than just spending 10 hours thinking about how to get started."" Le said her fiance, who often uses ChatGPT for work, is considering using AI to help with his vows too.  Joy co-founder and CEO Vishal Joshi, who studied artificial intelligence and electrical engineering at NIT Rourkela in India, said the company launched Writer's Block Assistant in March after it conducted an internal study that found most of its users were somewhat overwhelmed with getting started on writing vows and speeches, and wished they had help. He said the company has already seen thousands of submissions since launching the tool. ""Almost two decades ago, AI enthusiasts like myself and my research peers had only dreamt of mass market adoption we are seeing today, and we know this is just the true beginning,"" Joshi said. ""Just like smartphones, if applied well, the positive impact of AI on our lives can far outshine the negatives. We're working on responsibly innovating using AI to advance the wedding and event industry as a whole."" ChatGPT has sparked concerns in recent months about its potential to perpetuate biases, spread misinformation and upend certain livelihoods. Now, as it finds its way into marriage ceremonies, it could raise more nuanced questions about whether people risk losing something by injecting technology into what is supposed to be a deeply personal and, for many, spiritual moment in life. Michael Grinn, an anesthesiologist with practices in Miami and New York, was experimenting with ChatGPT when he asked it to produce a traditional Ketubah -- a Jewish marriage contract -- for his upcoming June wedding. Grinn and his fiance Kate Gardiner, the founder and CEO of a public relations firm, then requested it make some language changes around gender equality and intimacy. ""At the end, we both looked at each other and were like, we can't disagree with the result,"" he said. Editing took about an hour, but it still shaved hours off what otherwise could have been a lengthy process, he said. Still, Grinn plans to write his own vows. ""I want them to be less refined and something no one else helped me with."" He does, however, plan to use ChatGPT for inspiration for officiating his best man's wedding. ""It mostly comes down to time because I've been working so much,"" he said, ""and this is so efficient.""

                      Warren Buffett gives reason for surprise sale of stake in Taiwan's TSMC
                  ","
                      Warren Buffett says geopolitical tensions were ""a consideration"" in the decision to sell most of Berkshire Hathaway's shares in global chip giant TSMC, which is based in Taiwan. The 92-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" shed light on the investment call in a Tuesday interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei. He was quoted as sayiing that TSMC was a well-managed company but that Berkshire had ""better places"" to deploy its capital. In February, Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it had sold 86% of its shares in TSMC, which were purchased for $4.1 billion just months before. The quick sale was considered unusual because the billionaire is known for making longer term bets. The size of the purchase suggested that the initial purchase was most likely made personally by Buffett himself, rather than one of his portfolio managers, Reuters reported. TSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan and supplies semiconductors to tech giants including Apple and Qualcomm. It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China — which claims Taiwan as its own territory despite having never controlled it — that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a ""silicon shield"" against a potential military invasion by Beijing.  TSMC's presence is seen as providing a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force. This week, tensions soared across the Taiwan Strait after China simulated ""joint precision strikes"" on the island during a series of military exercises.  Beijing launched the drills on Saturday, a day after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a 10-day visit to Central America and the United States where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Chinese officials described the drills as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Beijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island. Taiwan and China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago, in which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei.

                      'None of us deserved it': Americans who survived kidnapping in Mexico share details of their captivity
                  ","
                      More than a month after four Americans were attacked and kidnapped by a drug cartel in Mexico, the two survivors say they're still recovering from the trauma of the terrifying ordeal and the killings of their friends. ""They didn't deserve that. None of us deserved it. But we're alive -- we have a lot of recovering to do,"" LaTavia Washington McGee told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview Tuesday. Washington McGee, Eric Williams, Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were kidnapped on March 3 as they were driving to a medical appointment in Matamoros, Mexico. Woodard and Brown were both killed. The attack came in broad daylight, with armed men ambushing the four friends not long after they crossed the US-Mexico border. Investigators believe the Americans were likely mistaken for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official familiar with the investigation previously told CNN.  The group was driving when they heard a car horn behind them. Brown looked back to see a gun and warned the others not to stop the car, Washington McGee recalled. Then, the shooting started. ""Zindell and Shaeed, they jumped up to run and they were gunned down,"" Williams said. As someone started to beat on the car window with a gun, Williams jumped out of the driver's side. ""That's when I was shot on both legs,"" Williams said. Washington McGee was forced into the bed of a pickup truck at gunpoint and the others were carried onto it -- a moment captured on video and shared by authorities after the kidnapping. An innocent Mexican bystander was killed during the encounter after being hit by a stray bullet almost a block and a half from where the Americans were taken, officials said. 'He said he loved us and he was gone' Williams and Washington McGee told CNN Brown and Woodward were both still alive when their limp bodies were dragged onto the truck bed. The four were then driven to another spot, where they were interrogated. ""That's where Shaeed said, 'I love y'all, and I'm gone.' And he died right there,"" Williams said. As Woodard lay dying in the back of the pickup truck, ""I told him I was sorry,"" Washington McGee recalled. ""He said he loved us and he was gone. It was the last thing he said,"" Williams said, through tears. 'Diablo masks' and guns Washington McGee and Williams said they were taken to several different locations over the days they spent in captivity, getting blindfolded as they were moved between locations. At one point, the group was taken to a house. Outside, they saw armed people in red, plastic ""Diablo"" masks who were ""pointing the guns to our head, telling us not to look up,"" Williams said. They were also taken to a clinic, where Williams described his leg being placed on a piece of wood and stitched up. ""No pain medicine or nothing. They just stitched it up,"" Williams said, adding that no one checked to see if a bullet was still inside. Washington McGee said she was put in a room with Brown, who was badly wounded and dying. ""He was fighting for his life and they didn't do nothing,"" she said. ""I talked to him the whole time ... I just told him sorry because I asked him to come with me."" ""He was like, 'It's okay. I'm your brother. I'm supposed to be there for you. I love you,'"" Washington McGee recalled. The kidnappers told them they would take Brown to a hospital, Washington McGee said, but ""they came back maybe an hour later and he was dead."" At one point, someone showed Washington McGee the video of their kidnapping. She saw herself being forced into the back of the truck. ""I just started crying. I'm like, I'm never going home"" she said. Then, there was hope. Washington McGee and Williams were woken up in a dark room to see a man standing over them with a light.  ""He was like, 'There's nothing that we can do to bring your two brothers back. But we're sorry. Somebody made the wrong call. They was high and drunk,'"" Washington McGee recalled the man saying. 'They were always a step ahead' At one point, Washington McGee and Williams were blindfolded and taken to a truck. Williams said his friends' bodies were then placed on top of him to keep him hidden. The Americans were driven around all night as they heard the sound of guns being cocked, Washington McGee said. ""They had police scanners and all types of stuff in their trucks. They knew what was going on. They were always a step ahead. So I was like, they're never gonna find us like this,"" McGee recalled. But eventually, they were dropped off at a wooden shack, where Washington McGee and Williams were rescued on March 7. The survivors and the bodies of their friends were brought back to the US. Washington McGee said she tried to escape twice during the ordeal, ""for my brothers to have the proper burial and for us to go back home to our family and kids."" An apology letter was later issued by the Gulf Cartel, which is believed to be responsible for the kidnappings, and the group handed over five of its members to local authorities, according to images circulating online and a version of the letter obtained by CNN from an official familiar with the ongoing investigation. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the photos and has asked Mexican and US authorities for comment. Though investigators believe the letter to be authentic, Mexican and US law enforcement officials participating in the investigation strongly doubt the sincerity of the group's apology, the official who shared the letter with CNN said. At least six people have been arrested in Mexico so far, according to Mexican officials.

                      5 things to know for April 12: Louisville, Toxic fire, Document leak, Cyclone, Books
                  ","
                      The 2024 Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago, where the party will officially nominate candidates for president and vice president. The DNC made the announcement Tuesday, calling the Midwest a ""critical Democratic stronghold"" that helped President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. Illinois' governor also heralded the move as ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' convention"" ahead of the pair's possible reelection bids. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""CNN's 5 Things"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Louisville shooting The city of Louisville will hold a vigil today to let community members grieve the five people killed this week in a bank shooting. The vigil comes a day after police released dramatic police body camera footage of the shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say a 25-year-old employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The shooter's motive for the rampage remains unclear at this time as authorities continue to comb through evidence. However, officials are expected to release audio today of 911 calls that could reveal more key details, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. The mayor on Tuesday also pleaded for state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence in Kentucky, which has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. 2. Indiana fire About 2,000 people in eastern Indiana received evacuation orders Tuesday after a large fire at a recycling plant began emitting toxic smoke. The fire, which created a thick, black plume over industrial buildings and a neighborhood, is expected to burn for days -- and is ""definitely toxic,"" Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said. ""There is a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they're on fire, and it's concerning and we want to make for sure we give people heads-up on an evacuation,"" Jones said. A preliminary investigation determined the fire started in a nearby semi-trailer before spreading to the facility, an official said, adding the exact cause will likely remain unknown until after it has been extinguished.  3. Leaked documents The leaked classified Pentagon documents posted to social media suggest the US is pessimistic that Ukraine can quickly end the war against Russia. The documents highlight specific weaknesses in both Ukraine's weaponry and Russia's military offensive, predicting a stalemate for months to come. The documents also indicate some intelligence that defense officials are gathering about China, the country Washington has deemed the ""most serious long-term challenge to the international order."" Officials say the leaking of the documents -- many of which are marked top secret -- represents a major national security breach. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security. 4. Cyclone Ilsa A major cyclone is threatening to hit Western Australia with winds strong enough to lift camper vans and trampolines. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said Cyclone Ilsa is expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday, somewhere between the towns of Broome and Port Hedland. The storm is expected to generate wind gusts of more than 250 kph (155 mph) by Thursday evening, equivalent to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the US. Local authorities warned residents to tie down anything that could become airborne and urged tourists to move from the projected path of the storm. Many people have flocked to supermarkets to stock up on food and other supplies ahead of the dangerous conditions. 5. Banned books A rural Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its public library shelves is now considering shutting down its libraries entirely. A meeting in Llano County today will include a discussion of whether to ""continue or cease operations"" of the library system, which includes three branches. The meeting comes after a federal judge last month ordered the library system to return 12 children's books to its shelves that had been removed, many because of their LGBTQ and racial content. It also follows several ongoing fights across the country to protect access to books in response to a boom of book bans that has taken shape in the US -- including in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries.

                      Kentucky has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the US
                  ","
                      A 25-year-old man in Kentucky legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership. Six days later he used that weapon to kill five of his colleagues at a downtown bank, Louisville Metro Police said Tuesday. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. Gun enthusiasts have described it as ""one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi."" By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state's laws as ""among the worst in the country.""  Kentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. ""Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there's no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they're ever used in a crime,"" CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said. ""Red flag"" laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out. If the Louisville mass shooter's behavior ""had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,"" she said. Prior to 2019 -- when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit -- individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. ""They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,"" Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone  eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there's no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over. Gun deaths across Kentucky in 2021 were 25% greater than in 2018, the year before permitless carry was allowed in the state, Mascia, said, adding gun homicides during the same time period were up  75%, which she said bucks the idea advanced by gun proponents that the best solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. While federal and state law prohibits convicted felons from gun possession, in Kentucky, domestic abusers on restraining orders, stalkers, fugitives, individuals convicted of hate crimes, and people found to be a danger to themselves or others all have legal access to guns, according to Everytown. In an emotionally charged press conference Tuesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, US Representative Morgan McGarvey and University of Louisville Health Chief Medical Officer Jason Smith called for city, state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence. ""The laws we have now are enabling violence and murder,"" the mayor said, and slammed a state law that requires law enforcement to put seized firearms up for auction to federally licensed firearms dealers holding a license appropriate for the type of firearm sold. Under Kentucky law, certain confiscated guns that are not retained for official use ""shall be sold at public auction,"" with partial proceeds going to public safety programs.  ""Think about that: that murder weapon will be back on the streets one day,"" Greenberg said. ""It's time to change this law and let us destroy illegal guns and destroy the guns that have been used to kill our friends and kill our neighbors."" ""We have to take action now. We need short term action to end this gun violence epidemic now, so fewer people die on our streets and in our banks in our schools,"" the mayor added. ""I don't care about finger pointing. I don't care about blame. I don't care about politics. I'm only interested in working together with our state legislators to take meaningful action to save lives to prevent more tragic injuries, and more death.""

                      Authorities in Louisville release bodycam video of police response to shooting at bank that left 5 people dead
                  ","
                      The Louisville Metro Police Department has released dramatic bodycam video of officers responding to the Monday bank shooting where five people were killed and an officer fatally shot the gunman.  The bodycam video shows the tense moments between police officers and the shooter, Connor Sturgeon. It begins with video from Officer Nickolas Wilt who drives up to the scene with his training officer, identified as Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. Wilt, police say, was shot in the head as he ran toward the gunshots police were facing as they arrived. He is listed in critical condition. Wilt's camera shows him following Galloway up the outside steps to the bank, his service pistol in his two hands. The video cuts off before he is shot. Bodycam footage from Galloway, who was also shot, shows him taking fire, then retreating to a safe position behind a planter as officers talk about how they can't see the gunman and that he is shooting through windows in the front of the bank. ""Shooter has an angle on that officer!"" one officer can be heard saying. ""We got to get up there!"" he adds. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said the gunman broke out glass from the lobby windows and when he fired, officers -- who could finally pinpoint his location -- shot back.  As he looks into the bank lobby, Galloway's camera audio sounds out with several shots. ""Suspect down, get the officer!!"" one officer yells as he moves up the stairs and into the bank to investigate further. Humphrey lauded the actions of the officers. ""Officer Wilt was a brand new officer, he had no experience. He was going based on two things: his training and his character. And you will see that he never hesitates -- even after getting shot at,"" Humphrey said at a news conference where nine minutes of video was released. When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Humphrey told reporters. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is ""100% certainty"" that those swift actions saved lives. ""The actions that they took to follow up after being shot at themselves, to be compassionate and provide medical treatment, absolutely saved lives that day,"" Humphrey said Officers took Wilt to the hospital in a patrol vehicle, officials said.  Shooter recently purchased his rifle The shooter legally bought an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership six days before he used it to kill five of his colleagues, the interim Louisville Metro Police chief said Tuesday. Currently, ""Kentucky imposes no waiting period between the time of purchase and the physical transfer of a firearm,"" according to the Giffords Law Center. By comparison, some states have waiting periods of 7 to 10 days. It's still not clear what provoked Sturgeon, a 25-year-old employee,  to go on a deadly rampage at Old National Bank and livestream the gruesome attack on Instagram. Sturgeon had interned at the bank for three summers and been employed there full-time for about two years, his LinkedIn profile showed. A law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that the assailant had been notified that he was going to be fired from the bank. But Louisville's mayor and police chief have since said otherwise, with interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel telling CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday that that there ""was no discussion about this individual being terminated"" before the massacre. Now, investigators are combing through the footage and other evidence to try to understand what led to the massacre that also left several wounded -- including a police officer who was shot in the head.  Officials executed a search warrant at Sturgeon's home, but Gwinn-Villaroel declined to say what was found.  The carnage marked the 146th mass shooting this year with four or more victims, not including a gunman, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  And the AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago that's reignited a fierce political fight over gun control.  What the livestream video shows It took just one minute for a gunman to complete his deadly rampage before he stopped and waited for police to arrive, according to footage of the massacre described by a city official to CNN.  The video begins by showing an AR-15-style weapon, followed by a worker in the bank saying good morning to the gunman, the official said. ""You need to get out of here,"" the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the livestream, which has been taken down by Instagram's parent company Meta. The gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can't because the safety is on and the weapon still needs to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.  The assailant then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they tried to outrun him, the official said. The shooter does not go to other populated floors of the bank, the official said. Once the shooter is done firing, he sits down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street, apparently waiting for police, the official said. The killer waits about a minute and a half before police arrive --  a swift response praised by local leaders -- and a gunfight ensues, the official said. The gunman was struck and killed. The entire incident -- from when the gunman started shooting to when he was killed -- lasted about nine minutes, Louisville Police Lt. Col. Aaron Cromwell said.  After the first bullets flew, ""There's a few minutes after that before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that when we respond to the scene,"" Cromwell said Tuesday. ""And then about three minutes after we respond, the subject is neutralized."" At one point, a Louisville police dispatcher alerted officers: ""25-year-old White male, Connor Sturgeon 6 4'. He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" according to Broadcastify audio. The timing of the dispatch wasn't immediately clear. A manager 'witnessed people being murdered' during a meeting The massacre started around 8:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Staff members were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the gunman opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN. She said the massacre ""happened very quickly."" Buchheit-Sims attended the staff meeting virtually and watched in horror as gunfire exploded on her computer screen. ""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she told CNN. ""I don't know how else to say that."" Four victims died shortly after the shooting: Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, police said. A fifth victim, Deana Eckert, 57, died later Monday.  Of the nine patients hospitalized shortly after the shooting, four have been discharged and one has died. One still in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, a University of Louisville Hospital spokesperson said Tuesday.  'I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense' Before Monday's massacre, the gunman had not had ""any prior engagement"" with police, the interim chief said.   Sturgeon graduated in December 2020 from the University of Alabama, where he earned his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance, according to a university spokesperson.   After three consecutive summers interning at Old National Bank, he was hired as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.   One of Sturgeon's former high school classmates who knew the shooter and his family well said the horrific news Monday came as a ""total shock.""  ""I can't believe it,"" said the former classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense."" Victim was an 'incredible friend' and mentor One of the slain victims, bank senior vice president Tommy Elliott, was remembered by local and state leaders as a close mentor and beloved community leader.  ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" said Yates, the state senator. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up.""   Elliott was also close friends with the governor and Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott's wife.  ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and called the other slain victims ""amazing people"" who will be mourned by their loved ones.  The city is setting up a family assistance center in collaboration with the American Red Cross to provide support for those impacted, the mayor said.  ""To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,"" Greenberg said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled Tommy Elliott's last name. It has also been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.

                      Zelensky slams 'beasts' who purportedly beheaded Ukrainian soldiers after video emerges
                  ","
                      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday condemned as ""beasts"" those who purportedly beheaded Ukrainian soldiers shown in two videos that emerged on social media in the past week. The videos appear to be of separate events -- one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video, which was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker's identification. ""(The armored vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,"" the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, ""They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.""  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war's fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video's location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. Zelensky vowed those behind the purported atrocities would be held accountable. ""There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,"" he said in a video message. ""We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,"" he said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday the video was ""terrible"" but ""first of all, we need to verify the authenticity"" of the footage.   In his regular call with journalist, Peskov said: ""Of course, these are terrible shots. Then it may be a reason to check whether this is true or not, whether this took place and, if so, where and from which side."" On Monday, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Wagner was ""reportedly continuing to commit war crimes by beheading Ukrainian servicemen in Bakhmut,"" referencing a photo shared on pro-Russian social media sites showing what appeared to be a severed head, which they claimed belonged to a Ukrainian soldier, mounted on a spike. The ISW has reported similar incidents in Popasna, in the Luhansk region, where Wagner troops were also operating earlier in the war. Some pro-Russian social media accounts have suggested Ukrainian forces were responsible for the beheadings in an effort to conceal identification. This echoes a similar claim made by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in January after his fighters apparently found bodies with severed hands and heads near Bakhmut. Dariia Zarivna, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Wednesday the videos are part of a psychological operation ""aimed at intimidation."" ""It completely dehumanizes and demonstrates the essence of a terrorist country,"" she said of the videos. ""But it is important to understand the purpose. This is an PSYOP [psychological operation] aimed at intimidation. The target audience is not only Ukraine, but also Western societies,"" she reasoned. ""It doesn't work on us, though. The Russians are afraid of this, but not us,"" she added.

                      Russians fear a second wave of mobilization, as Putin prepares to make it harder to avoid a military call-up
                  ","
                      When Vladimir Putin tried to mobilize hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in his invasion of Ukraine last September, chaos, fear and anger reverberated through Russia. For many, those feelings returned on Wednesday after the Russian parliament approved a law that made the country's conscription program more efficient, more modern -- and harder to evade. ""We have been expecting the second mobilization wave for a long time now, and this is the beginning,"" Irina, a 51-year-old psychologist whose son is of mobilization age, told CNN from Moscow. ""These amendments have already had their effect on me, by contributing to a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety."" The new bill -- passed by lawmakers on Wednesday, and awaiting only Putin's signature before it becomes law -- is, according to the Kremlin, an unremarkable streamlining of Russia's biannual conscription process. It would allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers, in addition to traditional letters, and bans those liable for military service from traveling abroad. It also includes tough penalties for those who ignore a summons -- barring them from getting a loan, moving into a new apartment, registering as self-employed and driving a vehicle. But CNN spoke to a number of Russians who dismiss the Kremlin's reassurances, and say the move lays the groundwork for another attempt to force Russians onto the battlefields in Ukraine. ""This is the second wave,"" Irina said. ""Of course, they have to feed this war with fresh meat all the time. ""During the first wave they used police raids to round up conscripts. People didn't like that. So now they are trying to concoct something different,"" she said. ""This may well be an attempt to avoid the full-scale manhunt they employed before, which caused so much panic,"" added Artem, 25, who dodged the September mobilization despite receiving a call-up. ""I am not at all convinced these measures will help to avoid a rampant mobilization like in autumn last year."" But he is certain of one thing: if another attempt at mass mobilization arrives, he will not comply. ""My relatives, not fit for army service, can drive my car if they take away my license,"" he said. ""I don't own any real estate. And the traveling ban has more of a psychological effect on me than practical -- or I would have left long ago."" He is confident his friends and family would take a similar approach. ""It will prompt them to take more measures to dodge. Some will leave, others -- move to their country homes, still others -- forge their documents,"" he said. ""Everyone will have to find some ways around this somehow. ""None of the people I know -- my friends and aquaintances will go to conscription centers,"" concurred Irina. ""They will employ anything to avoid getting there,"" she said. ""It's better to be sent to prison than be killed."" 'I don't believe a word' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that the new bill is meant only to ""fix the mess"" that followed September's controversial partial mobilization order. It was a rare admission of failure that reflected how damaging that initial effort was. The order was beset by issues, and prompted thousands of Russians to flee to the border. Asked during a regular call with reporters if the Kremlin is concerned that the impending new law would trigger another wave of mass exodus of Russians, Peskov said: ""Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with mobilization, it has to do with military registration."" ""I don't believe a word of this,"" Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN. While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to their own guidelines when calling up recruits. ""Now it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become,"" he said.  Currently, conscription documents in Russia must be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer. The new bill makes an electronic summons -- uploaded to a government portal called Gosuslugi -- equal to the traditional method, and does not take into account whether it has been read. Russia's Defense Ministry routinely conscripts men for compulsory military service twice a year, in spring and autumn. The spring conscription this year will apply to 147,000 citizens aged between 18 and 27 and will take place from April 1 to July 15, according to an official document published by the government. Officials say the changes are related to this process, which was ongoing in Russia before it invaded Ukraine last year. But the memories of September are felt intensely among young men and families around the country. ""I have no trust in today's authorities in Russia. I fear for my son even more than about my own life,"" said Alexey, whose son falls within the official age range for conscription. Is another exodus possible? The prospect of leaving Russia has been a realistic one for many who oppose the war, and who have avoided or fear a call-up.  ""Should (the war) drag on and intensify, and if there is a real second wave of mobilization, then I think some will try to leave (Russia), of course,"" said Olga, a 48-year-old woman who fears her son, who is 16, will be sent to fight in the coming years, disrupting his plans for higher education. ""I feel very badly about this war. And same goes for all other wars and any deaths by force regardless of the cause,"" she said. ""I would prefer for wars to be fought only by professional military or volunteers. But fleeing is a difficult proposition. Artem told CNN he is exploring the possibility, but sees few options and fears being unable to find work abroad. ""I do not rule out leaving Russia but I don't see how, if they impose the ban on draft dodgers traveling abroad,"" added Irina. ""I don't see a solution here."" ""And even if it were possible, finding work and accommodation abroad is not so simple. Many of those who had left in autumn last year had returned,"" she said. ""But, of course, I would feel much better had my son been living in another country. My daughter had left two years ago and I worry about her much less than I would, had she been here."" Though the Kremlin has been quick to downplay the significance of the move, its provisions and timing are convenient for a military bogged down in stalemate in its ground campaign in eastern Ukraine, after months of grinding combat which has bled their manpower and weaponry. Western officials last week told CNN they believe Russia has a problem generating ""trained military manpower.""  ""[Russia has] acknowledged that they needed 400,000 more troops and that's not just for the conflict [in Ukraine], but also to fulfill new formations which are going to be put on the new border with NATO and Finland,"" the officials said in a briefing on Wednesday, answering a question from CNN. ""How they generate that is unclear at the moment,"" the officials added, noting that a new wave of call-ups would pose risks for Moscow. ""Whether the population can sustain another round of mobilization and whether the Kremlin actually wants to test the population's resilience to that it is unclear at the moment, but the fact they haven't done would indicate to us that they have some concerns about that."" The war appears to remain generally popular in Russia -- a sentiment reinforced by relentless propaganda on state-controlled media outlets -- but analysts have noted that September's mobilization order was a turning point for many Russians, bringing the realities of conflict home to families across the country. For those who oppose the conflict, it only hardened their opposition. ""Is it the second wave? (It) seems very much so,"" Artem said. ""But any wave of mobilization is intended to supply the front with more meat."" Summing up his feelings, and referring to Putin by his first and middle names, he added: ""Try and recall all of the most eloquent obscenities you know ... that would be my view on the war, the draft and everything to do with Vladimir Vladimirovich's system of governing.""

                      Fed official: Central bank should be 'cautious' in wake of banking turmoil
                  ","
                      The banking crisis could help the Federal Reserve's fight to bring down inflation, but the central bank needs to be ""cautious"" in its actions moving forward, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Tuesday.  Goolsbee, the newest Fed appointee, spoke before the Economic Club of Chicago and addressed the ""new, big, hairy elephant in the room"" that was the recent failure of two regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and subsequent market turmoil. ""At moments of financial stress like this, the right monetary policy is really caution and watchfulness and prudence,"" he said. ""And I don't say that because I think we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation just because markets got upset."" But instead of financial issues trumping monetary policy concerns, financial conditions should certainly be included in monetary policy discussions, Goolsbee said.  ""History has taught us that in moments of financial stress, even if they don't escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting monetary policy,"" he said.  Currently, he added, there's not conflict between monetary policy and potentially tightening credit conditions. They would work in tandem to cool inflation, he said.  Still, Goolsbee added, the Fed needs to be ""on watch"" for the possibility of tighter credit conditions. ""If the response to these banking problems leads the financial industry to tighten on its own, that monetary policy has to do less,"" he said. ""It's not clear yet, exactly how much less."" He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the recent turmoil equates to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three quarters of a point. ""Given how much uncertainty abounds when these financial headwinds are going, I think we need to be cautious,"" he said. ""We should gather further data and we should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are going for us in getting inflation down."" Goolsbee said the foremost pieces of data he'll be looking for in advance of the Fed's next meeting in early May will be about how much credit tightening is occurring.

                      Leon Levine, discount store pioneer, dies at 85
                  ","
                      Leon Levine, who built Family Dollar into a discount retail giant catering to America's lower-income and middle-class shoppers, has died at 85. The Leon Levine Foundation, the philanthropic organization Levine later founded, confirmed in an online statement he died on April 5. No cause was listed. Levine, a college dropout, was one of several retail founders who ushered in a boom of stores selling low-cost goods. Discount stores have thrived in recent decades as the income gap in the United States has widened. Three dollar store chains — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — are now the fastest-growing US retailers. Levine opened the first Family Dollar store in 1959 at age 22 in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his cousin. The store sold clothing, cleaning supplies and essentials for under $2. Family Dollar grew around the rural South and by 1969 had 50 stores. The company went public in 1970, the same year as Walmart. Levine found a niche appealing to lower-income customers in mostly rural areas. He would look for new store locations by driving around and checking supermarket parking lots. Fresh oil spots on the pavement meant the locals drove older cars and didn't have much money for repairs, the Charlotte Observer reported in 2004. Levine's Family Dollar bucked a trend in retail at the time toward building large stores in the fast-growing suburbs. Instead, the company opted for locations the size of convenience stores close to shoppers' homes. During the 1970s and 1980s, as department stores like Sears opened in malls and Walmart was beginning to build large superstores, Family Dollar built small stores in neighborhood strip malls.  Stores were typically 6,000 to 8,000 square feet and were easy for quick visits. ""We're just the opposite of a Wal-Mart,"" Family Dollar president George Mahoney told the Associated Press in 1993. ""Our customers don't want the hassle of shopping in a huge store, or they lack the funds to shop there."" By 1993, Family Dollar had 2,000 stores. A decade later, when Levine retired from Family Dollar, the company had around 4,500 stores. (Today, there are more than 8,000 Family Dollar stores. Dollar Tree bought the chain in 2015 for nearly $9 billion.) After he retired from Family Dollar, Levine became one the largest philanthropists in the South, donating hundreds of millions of dollars to universities, hospitals and Jewish organizations.

                      IMF: Banking crisis boosts risks and dims outlook for world economy
                  ","
                      At the start of the year, economists and corporate leaders expressed optimism that global economic growth might not slow down as much as they had feared. Positive developments included China's reopening, signs of resilience in Europe and falling energy prices. But a crisis in the banking sector that emerged last month has changed the calculus. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecasts for the global economy Tuesday, noting ""the recent increase in financial market volatility."" The IMF now expects economic growth to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. Its estimate in January had been for 2.9% growth this year. ""Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled,"" the organization said in its latest report. Fears about the economic outlook have increased following the failures in March of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, two regional US lenders, and the loss of confidence in the much-larger Credit Suisse, which was sold to rival UBS in a government-backed rescue deal. Already, the global economy was grappling with the consequences of high and persistent inflation, the rapid rise in interest rates to fight it, elevated debt levels and Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, concerns about the health of the banking industry join the list. ""These forces are now overlaid by, and interacting with, new financial stability concerns,"" the IMF said, noting that policymakers trying to tame inflation while averting a ""hard landing,"" or a painful recession, ""may face difficult trade-offs."" Global inflation, which the IMF said was proving ""much stickier than anticipated,"" is expected to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% this year and to 4.9% in 2024. Changing forecasts Investors are looking for additional pockets of vulnerability in the financial sector. Meanwhile, lenders may turn more conservative to preserve cash they may need to deal with an unpredictable environment. That would make it harder for businesses and households to access loans, weighing on economic output over time. ""Financial conditions have tightened, which is likely to entail lower lending and activity if they persist,"" said the IMF, which hosts its spring meeting alongside the World Bank this week. If another shock to the world's financial system results in a ""sharp"" deterioration in financial conditions, global growth could slow to 1% this year, the IMF warned. That would mean ""near-stagnant income per capita."" The group put the probably of this happening at about 15%. The IMF acknowledged forecasting was difficult in this climate. The ""fog around the world economic outlook has thickened,"" it said. And it warned that weak growth would likely persist for years. Looking ahead to 2028, global growth is estimated at 3%, the lowest medium-term forecast since 1990.  The IMF said this sluggishness was attributable in part to scarring from the pandemic, aging workforces and geopolitical fragmentation, pointing to Britain's decision to leave the European Union, economic tensions between the United States and China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Interest rates in advanced economies are likely to revert to their pre-pandemic levels once the current spell of high inflation has passed, the IMF also said.     The body's forecast for global growth this year is now closer to that of the World Bank. David Malpass, the outgoing World Bank president, told reporters Monday that the group now saw a 2% expansion in output in 2023, up from 1.7% predicted in January, Reuters has reported. Not 2008, but... In a separate report published Tuesday, the IMF said that while the rapid increase in interest rates was straining banks and other financial firms, there were fundamental differences from the 2008 global financial crisis.  Banks now have much more capital to be able to withstand shocks. They also have curbed risky lending due to stricter regulations.  Instead, the IMF pointed to similarities between the latest banking turmoil and the US savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, when trouble at smaller institutions hurt confidence in the broader financial system. So far, investors are ""pricing a fairly optimistic scenario,"" the IMF noted in a blog based on the report, adding that access to credit was actually greater now than it had been in October.  ""While market participants see recession probabilities as high, they also expect the depth of the recession to be modest,"" the IMF said. Yet those expectations could be quickly upended. If inflation rises further, for example, investors could judge that interest rates will stay higher for longer, the group wrote in the blog.  ""Stresses could then reemerge in the financial system,"" it noted. That bolsters the need for decisive action by policymakers, the IMF said. It called for gaps in supervision and regulation to ""be addressed at once,"" citing the need in many countries for stronger plans to wind down failed banks and for improvements to deposit insurance programs. — Olesya Dmitracova contributed to this report.

                      What we know about the Daniel Perry case and what happens next after Texas' governor says he wants to pardon him
                  ","
                      As the Texas pardons board weighs a request from the governor for an expedited review of the conviction of an Army sergeant who fatally shot a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally, an attorney for the victim's family is calling for the full legal process to play out first, including sentencing and an appeal. Daniel Perry, 35, was convicted Friday of murder in the fatal shooting of Garrett Foster, 28, at the rally in Austin in 2020, which followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Both men are White. The jury found Perry not guilty on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a deadly conduct charge is still pending with the county attorney's office. ""I am working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a tweet Saturday. ""Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney."" Abbott said he asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite his requested review of Perry's conviction, noting Texas law doesn't allow him to approve a pardon without a recommendation from the board. ""I look forward to approving the Board's pardon recommendation as soon as it hits my desk,"" Abbott said in a statement. Perry's attorneys filed a motion Tuesday asking for a new trial, arguing that the defense team was not allowed to introduce evidence they believe showed Foster repeatedly instigated confrontations and harassed other drivers on the streets before the night of the deadly shooting. Travis County District Attorney José Garza's office responded to Tuesday's motion by saying it has ""full confidence in the guilty verdict."" ""These motions are standard motions filed by the defense following a guilty verdict,"" a statement from Garza's office reads. ""We applaud the defense team for making use of the procedural safeguards that are available to defendants in our criminal justice system. However, we continue to stand by the jury's unanimous decision to convict Daniel Perry for the murder of Garrett Foster."" Garza earlier called Abbott's intervention in the case ""deeply troubling."" ""Make no mistake, without intervention from the Governor, the defendant's conviction would be reviewed by both state and federal courts who will examine the record to ensure that no legal errors were made at this level and that the evidence supported the conviction,"" Garza said.  On Tuesday, Garza wrote to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles asking to meet with them to present evidence considered by jurors in the case, he said in a statement. He also asked the board to meet with Foster's family and consider the public safety implications of their decision before making a final recommendation.  ""For as long the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has existed, it has been a cautious steward of the power of clemency in our State,"" Garza said. ""We look forward to working with the Board to present all evidence necessary for its consideration.""  A civil attorney representing Foster's family also criticized Abbott's move for a pardon before the sentencing and appeals process, saying it ""turns the rule of law on its head."" Jurors in the case heard from 40 witnesses and deliberated for 15 hours, attorney Quentin Brogdon said in a statement, noting state and federal courts have the power to overturn the conviction if they find it was ""contrary to the rule of law."" ""Nobody, including the Governor of the State of Texas, should shut down that process, and any attempt to do so threatens the rule of law for all of us,"" Brogdon said. A judge is expected to set a sentencing hearing for Perry.  What happened in Austin  On the night of July 25, 2020, Perry, an active duty sergeant at nearby Fort Hood, was working as a rideshare driver to make extra money, his attorney Clint Broden previously said. He carried a handgun in his car for protection, Broden said. Perry dropped a passenger off near the rally, which he did not know was taking place, Broden added. Several people then began beating on Perry's car and a man carrying an assault-style rifle approached the car and motioned with the rifle for Perry to lower his window, according to Broden. ""Foster, the individual with the assault rifle, began to raise the AK-47 toward Sgt. Perry. It was only then that Sgt. Perry, who carried a handgun in his car for his own protection, fired on Foster because he believed his life to be in jeopardy,"" Broden has said. The prosecution argued Perry initiated the encounter by running a red light to turn into the crowd gathered for the police brutality protest and had previously posted on social media about shooting protesters, according to CNN affiliate KEYE. Then-Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said officers responded to a 911 call in which the caller stated they had just shot someone who approached their car window and pointed a rifle at them. One witness to the shooting, James Sasinowski, told CNN at the time that the driver of the car initiated the encounter by accelerating toward the protesters.  ""This was intentional. It was aggressive and he accelerated into a crowd of protesters,"" Sasinowski said. ""He could have waited for us to pass or he could have gone slowly. We would have allowed him to go through.""  How the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles makes its recommendation The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles confirmed Monday it had received a request from Abbott for an expedited pardon review for Perry. ""The board will be commencing that investigation immediately"" and will report to the governor with recommendations after the investigation is completed, Rachel Alderete, a spokesperson for the board, told CNN. CNN has asked for more information on how long the investigation could take and whether the appeal process needs to play out before the board can make a recommendation.  According to its website, the board uses ""research-based Parole Guidelines to assess offender's likelihood for a successful parole against the risk to society,"" when weighing parole decisions and also ""recommends clemency matters, including pardons, to the Governor."" Board members are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Currently, there are seven members, all of whom were either appointed or reappointed to the board during Abbott's time in office. The governor has the power to pardon any crime after conviction, except treason or impeachment -- but only if a majority of board members approve the recommendation, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Abbott granted two pardons in 2022, eight in 2021 and seven in 2020, based on the parole board's recommendations, according to the Texas Tribune, all for lower-level offenses like theft, providing alcohol to a minor, assault by contact, burglary of a vehicle, credit card abuse and illegally carrying a firearm. In 2021, the board, citing procedural errors, withdrew George Floyd's Clemency recommendation after it previously voted unanimously to recommend a full posthumous pardon of Floyd for a 2004 drug conviction, according to hearing minutes provided by the board to CNN.  What Texas' 'stand your ground' law says Abbott's statement on his pardon request references Texas' ""stand your ground"" law, which he says is one of the strongest in the country. Stand your ground laws allow people to respond to threats with potentially lethal force without fear of criminal prosecution in a place where they have a right to be. Not all states have such a law and those that do, word -- and even enforce -- them differently. Thirty states have enacted stand your ground laws, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Texas law says a person can use force as a means of self-defense if they reasonably believe the force is immediately necessary to protect them against another's use or attempted use of force.  Supporters of the laws, including the National Rifle Association, say they give people the right to protect themselves, no matter where they are. Critics say the laws encourage violence and allow for legal racial bias.

                      Reinstated Tennessee lawmaker Justin Jones says he'll continue to call for gun reform
                  ","
                      After being sworn back into the Tennessee House of Representatives, a lawmaker who was expelled just days ago over a gun control demonstration on the chamber floor said he'll continue to call for gun reform. ""The first thing I do when I walk into this building as a representative is to continue that call for commonsense gun legislation,"" Democrat Justin Jones said as he stood on the steps of the Capitol after his reinstatement Monday. Jones and another Black Democrat, Justin J. Pearson, were forced out of the Republican-controlled legislature last week, after a protest on the chamber floor spurred by the mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead.  A third Democrat who had joined them in protest, Rep. Gloria Johnson, avoided expulsion. She is White. The Nashville Metropolitan Council voted 36-0 Monday to reappoint Jones to the House of Representatives, making him once again the representative of House District 52 -- but this time in the interim. State law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held.  ""Today we are sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence,"" Jones said to a cheering crowd Monday after marching back to the Capitol. Now technically a new member, Jones said he can file 15 bills. He'll be working on gun reform legislation as soon as he returns Tuesday, he told CNN on Monday evening. Each of those bills would have to do with gun reform, he said, because ""that's what these young people are begging us to do."" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, announced Tuesday he would ask the General Assembly to strengthen the state's gun laws this session, with legislation instituting an ""order of protection law,"" which would allow officials to strip access to weapons from ""individuals who are a threat to themselves or our society.""  Regarding Jones' reinstatement, the Tennessee House Republicans released a statement on Monday, saying, ""Tennessee's constitution provides a pathway back from expulsion. Should any expelled member be reappointed, we will welcome them. Like everyone else, they are expected to follow the rules of the House as well as state law."" Jones' return ""just felt right,"" Johnson told ""CNN This Morning"" Tuesday, underscoring the need for ""young, passionate voices"" like Jones' and Pearson's who are willing to fight for their constituents.  ""It was so good to have him back in the body,"" she said, ""overwhelmingly supported by not only his district but every district in Davidson County."" Meanwhile, Pearson's still vacant District 86 seat is set to be addressed Wednesday during a Shelby County Board of Commissioners meeting in Memphis, announced Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery, who said Pearson's expulsion was ""conducted in a hasty manner without consideration of other corrective action methods."" ""To anyone who has doubted the South, anyone who's doubted the power of Tennesseans to advocate for an end to gun violence, anybody who's doubted the movement to end assault weapons -- anybody who's doubted the movement, here's your answer: The movement still lives,"" said Pearson as he stood on the steps of the Capitol alongside Jones on Monday. Pearson told CNN's John Berman that while Monday brought celebration of Jones' reinstatement, it was also another tragic day marked by a mass shooting in Louisville, Kentucky -- less than a month after the school shooting in Tennessee that prompted the lawmakers' protest. The shooting in Louisville points to a ""sobering reality that we are in that we are not doing enough to prevent gun violence,"" Pearson added. ""It's also a painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like (Speaker of the House) Cameron Sexton and the Republican party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all of the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,"" Pearson told CNN.  What happens next? Since there are more than 12 months until the next general election in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats, according to the Tennessee Constitution. No date has been set for a special election, but state law says the governor should schedule them within 55 to 60 days. It appears both Jones and Pearson qualify to run for their seats again in the special election. In the meantime, ""the legislative body of the replaced legislator's county of residence at the time of his or her election may elect an interim successor,"" the state Constitution says. Sexton, the Speaker of the House, indicated earlier Monday that he would not stand in the way of the appointments if the local governing bodies choose to send Jones and Pearson back to the chamber. ""The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats,"" a spokesperson for the speaker's office told CNN on Monday. ""Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires."" On Monday, Jones called for Sexton's resignation.  ""He is an enemy of democracy, and he doesn't deserve to be in that office of a speaker of the House any longer,"" Jones told CNN.  Johnson agreed, accusing Sexton of limiting debate on the House floor until last week, when the nation's eyes turned to watch the proceedings against Jones, Johnson and Pearson.  ""Before the hearings, we had more healthy debate on bills than I think we've ever had in three or four years on the House floor,"" she told CNN on Tuesday, ""because people were watching.""  CNN has reached out to Sexton for comment. In expelling Jones and Pearson last week, Republicans held a party-line vote to oust them, accusing them of ""knowingly and intentionally"" bringing ""disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives"" without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. While the state Constitution says members can be expelled for disorderly behavior with a two-thirds majority vote, they cannot be expelled ""a second time for the same offense.""  Expulsions were 'unconstitutional,' attorneys say Attorneys for the ousted representatives -- among them former US Attorney General Eric Holder -- sent a letter to Sexton Monday, calling their removals ""unconstitutional.""  ""Their partisan expulsion was extraordinary, illegal and without any historical or legal precedent,"" the attorneys said. Holder and attorney Scott J. Crosby -- who are representing Jones and Pearson, respectively -- urged the House to not ""compound its errors by taking any further retributive actions."" ""Any partisan retributive action, such as the discriminatory treatment of elected officials, or threats or actions to withhold funding for government programs, would constitute further unconstitutional action that would require redress,"" the letter says. The Congressional Black Caucus released a statement Monday after Jones was reinstated to his seat. ""While this is what the residents of Nashville deserve, we must recognize that Rep. Jones was reappointed to his position not because the Republican majority did the right thing, but because Rep. Jones' constituents in Nashville, joined by supporters from all over our country, peacefully voiced their concerns about the prevalence of gun violence in our communities and the ongoing assault by Republicans on our democracy,"" the statement read.

                      Wall Street has found something else to worry about
                  ","
                      Persistent inflation remains the Federal Reserve's No. 1 concern, even as the banking sector remains on edge after two big bank failures last month. This week's Consumer Price Index, due to be announced Wednesday at 8:30 am ET, could determine whether the central bank raises rates again in May. That means it will also weigh on markets, especially now that Wall Street's focus has shifted from the financial system to the economy.  ""Inflation is no less relevant than it has been for the past two years,"" wrote Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""The Consumer Price Index remains the most-watched monthly economic report.""  So what are they expecting? What's happening: Core inflation levels have eased for five months in a row on an annual basis, according to CPI readings, but they still remain near historic highs at 6% -- well above the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%.  Last month's reading showed an increase in prices between January and February, which doesn't ""inspire confidence that 2% is just around the corner,"" said McBride.  For March, economists forecast a 0.4% monthly increase in the CPI, which matches the September - February average and would keep those year-over-year averages high.  So what will it take to make the Fed, and investors, happy?  ""To feel good about where inflation is headed, we need to see more than just moderation in the rate of both headline and core inflation,"" said McBride. ""We also need to see moderation in price pressures across a wide range of categories that are staples of the household budget: shelter, food, electricity, motor vehicle insurance, apparel, and household furnishings and operations."" But ""resiliently elevated prices have the potential to spark yet another Fed rate hike in May,"" said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments. That's notwithstanding the slowing economy ""that has been weighed down even more heavily by the banking system debacle,"" he added.  What it means for markets: Between inflation data and the start to the first-quarter corporate earnings season (three of the largest US banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup report this Friday), this week is set up for heightened stock volatility, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management.  ""Persistent inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty over the pace of earnings growth in 2023 remain headwinds to advancing equity prices. Each will be in focus this week,"" he said.  Retail investors are buying bank stocks  TD Ameritrade released its March Investor Movement Index on Monday, which tracks what retail investors are up to.  The report found that retail traders continued to be net buyers of equities in March. That means Main Street traders, not large financial institutions, are purchasing the majority of new stock in the US. The increasing power of the retail investor -- fueled by stimulus cash, easier access to trading platforms and more market education amongst other things, has been an ongoing trend since the beginning of the pandemic. Lately, large companies have begun to change their investor relations strategies to become more retail investor friendly. Now even the 'smart money' traders are using Reddit for stock tips. So where are they investing? The strongest buying interest is in the Financial sector, found TD Ameritrade. That comes despite macroeconomic catalysts in March like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the emergency sale of Credit Suisse.  ""March was full of surprises, but the overall impact among TD Ameritrade retail clients when it came to exposure to the markets was neutral,"" said Lorraine Gavican-Kerr, managing director at TD Ameritrade. ""For the second month in a row, our clients were net buyers of equities, seemingly eying an opportunity to buy into the Financial sector's lows and to sell off the highs in Information Technology."" The five most popular stocks to purchase, according to TD Ameritrade were Tesla, Rivian, Ford Motors, Amazon, and the embattled First Republic Bank.  Retail investors, meanwhile, were net sellers of Meta, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devises, Intel and Apple.  NY Fed says short-term inflation expectations have increased Inflation expectations have increased at the short-term and medium-term horizons, according to The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's March Survey of Consumer Expectations, released on Monday.  Inflation expectations for the year ahead have increased by half a percentage point to 4.7%, the survey found. That marks the first increase since October 2022.  The survey, which questions about 1,300 household heads in the US each month, also found that respondents were more pessimistic about the outlook for the US labor market than they were in previous months. Unemployment expectations — or the probability that the US unemployment rate will be higher one year from now — increased by 1.3 percentage points to 40.7%, the New York Fed found.  The recent banking crisis and looming credit crunch also appears to be worrying households in the United States. The Fed reported that ""perceptions of credit access compared to a year ago deteriorated in March."" The share of households that said it's harder to obtain credit than one year ago reached an all time high.

                      See the Chipotle of the future
                  ","
                      The distinctive gas grills in Chipotle restaurants might be a thing of the past. On Tuesday, the fast casual Mexican chain unveiled an all-electric restaurant design that is completely powered by renewable energy, such as solar and wind. That means the gas grills that have become the focal point for walk-in customers are being replaced by electric systems, which are intended to help the chain achieve its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.  Noticeable changes in this new store format include rooftop solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations and biodegradable flatware and bowls. Other changes include cactus-leather chairs and artwork made from recycled rice husks. Chipotle will tweak the design based on feedback from customers and employees, the company said.  So far, two of these new locations have opened in Gloucester, Virginia and Jacksonville, Florida, with a third opening this summer in Castle Rock, Colorado. The goal is to have 100 new locations operating entirely on electricity next year, which is a small percentage of the long-sought goal of operating 7,000 locations across North America over the next several years.  The chain currently owns and operates 3,200 restaurants in the United States. Sustainability has long been a focus for Chipotle, which, along with other fast food chains, has been criticized for not being environmentally friendly. The chain is also increasing the amount of produce bought locally to cut down on fuel used during the transportation process, and is developing more vegan and vegetarian menu items. Chipotle is constantly tweaking its store designs. It's currently experimenting with designs that are smaller than its typical footprint and focuses on digital ordering so it can build new locations in urban areas where real estate is pricier.

                      Former Twitter executives sue company to recover over $1 million in legal fees
                  ","
                      Former senior executives of Twitter have sued the company in an attempt to recover more than $1 million in legal expenses incurred by responding to shareholder lawsuits, federal investigations and a congressional hearing, according to a complaint filed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court.  The lawsuit by former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, former chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde and former chief financial officer Ned Segal alleges that Twitter has failed to reimburse them for lawyers' fees in accordance with prior agreements with the company. Elon Musk fired the executives immediately after completing his acquisition of the company.   Twitter, which cut much of its public relations team last year, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The complaint was first reported by The New York Times.  According to exhibits filed with the complaint, Gadde alone spent more than $1 million preparing for her testimony in February before the House Oversight Committee, when the panel held a hearing focused on allegations that Twitter censored conservative speech. The complaint also describes legal fees linked to probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, though without disclosing many specifics of the investigations. The references to federal investigations underscore the continuing legal risk for Twitter under Musk, who is simultaneously struggling to shore up company finances while pushing a skeleton crew to make significant changes to the product. The SEC has previously probed Musk's investment in and deal to buy Twitter, including his apparent delay in disclosing his large ownership stake in the social media company. And last month, the Federal Trade Commission acknowledged a wide-ranging investigation into Twitter's privacy practices. The Justice Department has not previously confirmed any investigation into the company. The lawsuit outlines some details about the DOJ and SEC probes. It claims that Agrawal and Segal first began receiving requests from US officials around July of last year. Agrawal continued to field requests through the fall and after he stepped down from Twitter, according to the complaint. And late last year, it said, the Justice Department contacted Agrawal and Segal's attorneys about multiple investigations into Twitter.  Letters to Twitter seeking reimbursement for the legal expenses were ignored for months, according to the complaint. In March, the company allegedly responded by acknowledging the requests for reimbursement, but took no action to pay. As of Monday, the executives still have not recovered the fees, the complaint said.

                      Shares in Regal Cinemas' owner hit all-time low
                  ","
                      Cineworld's stock plummeted 36% Tuesday afternoon to an all-time low after the company said it had filed a plan to reorganize its business and shareholders would not recover any of their funds.  The embattled owner of Regal Cinemas said it had submitted a final version of the plan to a US bankruptcy court in Texas. It first announced details of the proposal on April 3. The company said already back in February that it expected shareholders to be wiped out entirely by the bankruptcy process, even if it sold some of its businesses. ""The proposed restructuring does not provide for any recovery for holders of Cineworld's existing equity interests,"" the company confirmed in a statement Tuesday.  Under the plan, Cineworld's lenders will cut its debt by $4.5 billion in exchange for equity in the reorganized company. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, described the market reaction to Cineworld's announcement Tuesday as ""severe."" Confirmation of the plan had ""extinguished any remaining hope from shareholders that this route could be avoided,"" she told CNN.  Like many of its competitors, the world's second-biggest movie theater operator was hit hard by the pandemic, reporting a combined loss of $3.3 billion over 2020 and 2021. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States in September.  Cineworld shares have lost 98% of their value since the company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. They were last trading at 1.1 pence (1.4 cents).   The stock closed 33% lower on April 3 after the company announced its reorganization plan and said it would halt all efforts to sell its US, UK and Irish businesses.  Tuesday's stock declines came as ""remaining equity holders rushed to sell their shares in an attempt to recoup something,"" Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, an online trading platform, told CNN. Cineworld reiterated that it hoped the restructuring plan — which the court and some of the company's creditors have yet to approve — would help it emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the first half of this year. In the meantime, Cineworld said, its movie theaters will continue to operate ""as usual without interruption.""

                      April 10, 2023 At least 5 killed in bank shooting in Louisville, Kentucky
                  ","
                      Our live coverage of the Louisville bank shooting has moved here.  The death toll in the Louisville bank shooting has risen to five, the Louisville Metro Police Department said late Monday. President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Monday evening about the shooting at a Louisville bank that left four people dead, the White House said. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. He said Congress needs to act on things like requiring safe storage of guns and background checks. A survivor of workplace gun violence himself, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he lost a very close friend, Thomas Elliot, in the Old National Bank shooting.  Greenberg said he was with Elliot's wife at the hospital earlier Monday morning. Elliot, a senior vice president at the bank, was also a close friend of Gov. Andy Beshear.   “It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,” he said speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well.” The mayor said he also visited Louisville Metro Police Officer Nickolas Wilt at the University of Louisville hospital saying he “made it through surgery and he's in serious condition at the hospital right now, but he is in great hands.”  Greenberg said he handed Wilt his graduation diploma from the police academy just a week and a half ago.  “I paid a visit to his academy class that was there at the hospital offering to support him, offering the support to he and his family today.” Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager with Old National Bank, told CNN she virtually witnessed the shooting Monday through her computer during a Microsoft Teams meeting.  “Shortly after the meeting started, the gunman, which is an employee, started shooting up the conference room,” Buchheit-Sims said. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that.”  “I’m just as much in shock and disbelief and was in disbelief as I watched it unravel,” she said of the incident, which she said “happened very quickly.”  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.  She described Sturgeon as someone with “just kind of a monotone personality.""  “His temperament is pretty low-key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed,"" she said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t know anything about Sturgeon having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as “extremely intelligent.”    At least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department. 
            Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
            Investigation: Police did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are ""hopeful"" that they can get the footage taken offline.
            Victims: The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according to updated information from the police department. Nine people were taken to the hospital, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Health. Three people have since been discharged, he said. Three others are in critical condition, including a recently graduated police officer who was shot in the head and had to have brain surgery, Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also injured.
            Reaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and State Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov. Andy Beshear said one of the victims, Tommy Elliot, was ""one of my closest friends"" and that the community will also mourn and miss all of the other victims. ##Catch Up## The city of Louisville will set up a family assistance center, in cooperation with the Red Cross, to help those affected by Monday’s bank shooting “deal with the trauma of this moment,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Monday afternoon.  “To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,” Greenberg said, adding that he is a survivor of a workplace shooting himself. “I’m a survivor of a workplace shooting. To the people who survived, whether you were physically hurt or not, I know that you’re hurting too. We are here for you as well,” Greenberg said.  In a statement Monday, Greenberg called the shooting at Old National Bank “another horrific tragedy” and asked for prayers for the “recovery of those who are receiving medical care, the families of those who lost a loved one, and those who are scared and heartbroken by what has happened this morning.” “Our deepest gratitude to the heroic efforts of first responders, who arrived within minutes of being called, and who risked their lives to save others. We will continue to provide updates throughout the day,” Greenberg said. CNN’s Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday repeatedly called on Congress to take actions to address gun violence, refusing to explicitly say whether President Joe Biden has exhausted all legal efforts to further combat the issue through executive action.  When asked during the White House press briefing if the president is at the end of his ability to do more on gun violence prevention, Jean-Pierre said, “So, there [are] actions that we have taken. The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”  The comments came hours after four people were killed in a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.  Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.  Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”  She said Biden has ""done a historic amount of work recently"" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.  She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all. We were just being mindful to the incoming information that was currently coming in from Louisville.”  Louisville shooter Connor Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be terminated from Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.  Sturgeon wrote a note for his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to shoot at the bank, the source said.  It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source.  The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has been taken down. Police are in possession of the video, according to the source. Connor Sturgeon, the 25-year-old identified by police as the gunman in Monday's mass shooting in Louisville, had worked for more than a year at the bank where he allegedly shot 13 people, killing at least four. At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age to 25 later in the day.)  Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” “This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,” said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. “I can’t even say how much this doesn’t make sense. I can’t believe it.” In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile. A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said. All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday.   “We are one commonwealth — united with the city, united with these families,” Beshear said at a news conference. Police said at least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital. Three of them remain in critical condition, the hospital said. The Louisville Police Department did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the man who is accused of killing at least four people at a bank Monday morning. Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department, said they are still working to learn more about the gunman. The shooter was killed by police shortly after he opened fire, police said. The gunman was shot and killed by police officers who were responding to the scene, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department. She said police got a call that there was a shooting at 8:35 a.m. ET and arrived at the bank three minutes later. Gwinn-Villaroel said officers ""responded in a timely, quick fashion, and we stopped the threat so that no additional loss of life could be taken."" Police previously said the gunman was dead, but did not confirm if he was shot by police or a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter was live streaming the attack on a Kentucky bank Monday morning, the interim chief of the Louisville police department said during a press conference. ""I will say this, that the suspect was live streaming. And unfortunately, that's tragic. To know that that incident was out there and captured,"" LMPD interim chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. Gwinn-Villaroel said that police are ""hopeful"" that they can get the footage taken offline. She didn't specify on what platform the suspect was live-streaming the shooting. Police released the names Monday of the four people who died following a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank. Here are the victims: Tommy Elliott, 63
            Jim Tutt, 64
            Josh Barrick, 40
            Juliana Farmer, 45  The post has been updated with the latest information from the police department on the victims' ages. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that one of those killed in the mass shooting Monday morning in Louisville was ""one of my closest friends."" Beshear said that Tommy Elliott, ""helped me build my law career. Help me become governor. Gave me advice on being a good dad.""  “He’s one of the people I talked to most in the world and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend,” the governor said. Elliott was the senior vice president of the bank, according to his LinkedIn. The governor said he received incorrect information earlier when he stated in a news conference that a second friend had been killed.  The governor also called the other deceased victims of the shooting ""amazing people"" whose communities will ""mourn"" and ""miss them."" CNN’s Celina Tebor contributed reporting to this post A Louisville Metro Police Department officer was shot in the head during a confrontation with the gunman Monday morning, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department. Nickolas Wilt, 26, was taken to the hospital and had brain surgery, she said during a news conference following the mass shooting that left four people dead. ""He is in critical but stable condition,"" she said. Wilt was new to the department, having graduated from the police academy at the end of March, she said. ""This will be a long complex investigation involving local, state and our federal partners,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also shot in the elbow, she said. Police identified the suspected shooter that killed at least four people at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, as Connor Sturgeon, a 25-year-old male.  He was employed at the bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel.  The shooter's ""weapon of choice"" was a rifle, Gwinn-Villaroel said.  The shooter died after officers exchanged gunfire with him, police added.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect age for the shooter based on information from police. He was 25. Kentucky officials are giving an update on the death of at least four people in a mass shooting at a bank in Louisville on Monday morning. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Gov. Andy Beshear are expected to give remarks. Police have said they believe there was only one shooter and that the gunman was a former employee of the bank. A local hospital received nine patients, two of them were police officers, according to officials. Three of them have been discharged, the hospital said. Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been briefed on the shooting that killed at least four people in Louisville, Kentucky, according to DHS spokesperson Marsha Espinosa. The secretary has been in contact with officials in the state, Espinosa said. Other federal officials have also been briefed on the shooting, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and President Joe Biden, the Justice Department and the White House said earlier. An officer hospitalized following the shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank is in critical condition, University of Louisville Hospital officials told CNN. Louisville police previously said at a news conference the officer was undergoing surgery. Two police officers were among nine people hospitalized following the shooting, hospital officials said. The University of Louisville Hospital received nine patients following a shooting at Old National Bank on Monday, hospital officials told CNN. Three of those nine patients have been discharged from the hospital, a spokesperson from the hospital said. Hospital officials will hold a press briefing with the Louisville mayor and Louisville Metro Police Department at 3 p.m. Monday. The manager at a brewery less than a block away from Old National Bank where at least four people were killed in a shooting Monday said the incident hits ""close to home."" Jason Smith, the operations manager at Against the Grain, a brewery in Louisville, said he was just arriving to work when he saw all first responders coming to the scene of the shooting at Old National Bank. The brewery is less than 500 feet away from the bank and both businesses are on the same street.  “Although we didn’t need to shelter in place, it kind of took a few minutes to figure out what was going on and assess the situation,” Smith told CNN affiliate WDRB.  Smith said the brewery has opened its doors to first responders, the mayor’s and governor’s teams, some chaplains, and said some of the employees from the bank have also come to the brewery. “I mean, these are our neighbors, you know, so we’re here to support and take care of them. We’re thinking about them,” Smith said.   President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting Monday at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, where four people were killed and nine others were injured. “Once again, our nation mourns after a senseless act of gun violence – Jill and I pray for the lives lost and impacted by today's shooting. Too many Americans are paying for the price of inaction with their lives. When will Republicans in Congress act to protect our communities?” Biden said in a tweet marking his first reaction to the shooting.  The current reality of a divided Congress makes additional legislative action highly unlikely.  In a second statement on the shooting, the president again called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. Biden said a ""strong majority of Americans"" want some kind of gun safety reform. He called for things like requiring safe storage of guns, background checks and changes to when gun manufacturers can be found liable. “Instead, from Florida to North Carolina to the U.S. House of Representatives, we’ve watched Republican officials double down on dangerous bills that make our schools, places of worship, and communities less safe. It’s unconscionable, it’s reckless, and too many Americans are paying with their lives,"" the president said. ##Reactions## Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on the fatal Louisville bank shooting, a Justice Department spokesperson said. Earlier today, the White House said President Joe Biden was informed of the shooting and the administration will have more to share later on.  Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville, Kentucky, called for action on gun violence in the wake of the shooting in his district today.  “Our community is one of far too many impacted by gun violence,” McGarvey said in a statement on Twitter. He said the shooting ""serves as a stark reminder that we need to address gun violence at the national level so no other family loses a son, a daughter, and a loved one.” He also thanked first responders for their quick action.  Read McGarvery's full statement: Kentucky state lawmakers are also calling for gun reform. State Sen. Karen Berg, who represents District 26 which includes parts of Louisville, said it's ""past time for action."" Berg said in a tweet that it is ""time to address common sense gun legislation,"" pointing out specific areas she wants to see change, including discussing red flag laws. State Rep. Lamin Swann, who represents a district near Lexington, tweeted, ""Common sense gun legislation NOW!"" Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed McGarvery's calls for ""stronger gun safety legislation"" in the other chamber of Congress. He said in a tweet the country grieves for those killed and their families, but noted that ""this cannot continue."" He said that lawmakers need to continue working for gun reform legislation. After a shooting at an elementary school in Nashville at the end of March, Schumer would not say whether he would put legislation to ban assault weapons on the Senate floor for a vote.  ##Reactions## The city of Louisville, Kentucky, has set up a family assistance center to help anyone looking to reunite with people involved in the bank shooting that killed at least four on Monday. The center is located at the Kentucky International Convention Center, Mayor Craig Greenberg said on Twitter. Read the tweet: The gun used in the Louisville bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source tells CNN.

                      Lori Vallow Daybell, Idaho mother accused of killing her children and conspiring to kill husband's ex-wife, was motivated by 'money, power and sex,' prosecutors say
                  ","
                      An Idaho mother who is accused of killing her two children and conspiring to kill her husband's ex-wife was motivated by ""money, power and sex,"" prosecutors said as opening statements in her trial began Monday, according to CNN affiliate East Idaho News. Lori Vallow Daybell is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy in the deaths as well as grand theft for collecting government benefits on behalf of her children after they were killed, the indictment states.  She has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jury selection took place last week. Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake told the jury on Monday that Vallow Daybell ""used money, power, and sex to get what she wanted. It didn't matter what it was,"" East Idaho News reported. The sensational case, featured in a Netflix true-crime documentary last year, involves the deaths of a number of family members and claims Vallow Daybell and her husband had apocalyptic religious beliefs. Two of Vallow Daybell's children from previous marriages, Tylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow, 7, were last seen on different days in September 2019. Shortly after that, she married Chad Daybell, whose ex-wife Tammy Daybell had died several weeks prior. ""The defendant will remove any obstacle in her way to get what she wants -- and she wanted Chad Daybell,"" Blake said, according to East Idaho News. Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves ""James and Elaina"" and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as ""light"" or ""dark,"" the prosecutor told jurors. Jim Archibald, an attorney for Vallow Daybell, painted a different picture Monday, saying in court: ""The evidence will show Lori was a kind and loving mother. The evidence will show Lori had an interest in religion -- especially the end of times."" ""Some people could care less about biblical prophecies, some people care a lot about it. Thankfully in this country we get the freedom to choose,"" said Archibald, according to the East Idaho News report. Archibald told the jury that prosecutors don't have enough evidence to prove Vallow Daybell's guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""Did she kill or did she assist or did she encourage or did she command? They (prosecutors) aren't sure what happened -- but they want you to be sure,"" Archibald told the jury, according to East Idaho News. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn't talked to him recently. Police didn't find him at the family's house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities.  When police returned the next day to serve a search warrant, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell's property in Fremont County, Idaho, and Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. ""You will hear it described as a mass of bone and tissue,"" Blake said during opening statements Monday, describing how Tylee's remains were found. ""That's what was left of this beautiful young woman. The defendant's daughter,"" Blake said, according to East Idaho News. JJ's body was wrapped in a plastic bag, according to Blake. Daybell, Vallow Daybell and her brother Alex Cox conspired to kill the children and Daybell's ex-wife, the indictment states. Vallow Daybell and Daybell ""did endorse and teach religious beliefs for the purpose of justifying"" the killings of JJ, Tylee, and Tammy Daybell, the indictment notes. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell ""being in Limbo"" and ""being possessed by a spirit named Viola,"" according to the indictment. Those close to the couple said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. JJ Vallow's grandmother, Kay Woodcock, was the first witness to take the stand Monday, testifying that her regular phone calls with her grandson dropped off after the death of Vallow Daybell's ex-husband, Charles Vallow, East Idaho News reported. The grandmother said the last conversation she had with JJ Vallow was on August 10, 2019, when she spoke to him during a short call that lasted less than a minute. She said she attempted over the next few months to contact her grandson, but never got any response from Vallow Daybell. Arizona police released body camera footage from January 2019 of Vallow Daybell's ex-husband saying he could not get in touch with the children. He said their marriage had rapidly deteriorated and ""she thinks she's a resurrected being and a god."" In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious doomsday prepper website which describes itself as a ""series of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation."" The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell in light of the children's disappearance. Vallow Daybell was initially ruled not mentally fit to stand trial, but a judge reversed the determination last year. Daybell's trial will be held separately. Vallow Daybell won't face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last month. Both have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Vallow Daybell has separately been charged in Arizona with conspiracy to commit murder in the July 2019 death of her estranged husband Charles Vallow. He was fatally shot by her brother Alex Cox, who later died in December 2019. CNN has reached out to prosecutors regarding those charges.

                      5 things to know for April 11: Louisville shooting, Covid, Fungus, Ukraine, Dalai Lama
                  ","
                      As the Pentagon investigates a major leak of classified documents that recently turned up on social media sites, dozens of them remain viewable on Twitter. This type of sensitive government information can slip under the radar for weeks, analysts say, because some social networks lack policies against posting classified information. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""CNN's 5 Things"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Louisville shooting A 25-year-old bank employee opened fire at his workplace in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday and livestreamed the attack that left five dead and eight others injured, authorities said. The gunman was killed by police after a shootout that wounded two officers, leaving one in critical condition. According to a source familiar with the investigation, the gunman left behind a note for his parents and a friend indicating he planned to carry out a shooting at his workplace, though it is unclear when the message was found. Monday's massacre is the 146th mass shooting so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving another community in mourning while lawmakers clash over possible gun violence solutions. 2. Covid-19 President Joe Biden signed a bill Monday ending the national emergency for Covid-19 -- months before he intended for the declarations to cease. One White House official downplayed the bill, saying that ""to be clear, ending the National Emergency will not impact the planned wind-down of the Public Health Emergency on May 11"" -- which enabled the government to provide many Americans with Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines at no charge. ""Since Congress moved to undo the National Emergency earlier than intended, we've been working with agencies to address the impacts of ending the declaration early,"" the official said. The bill to end the national emergency cleared the Senate last month in a bipartisan 68-23 vote and passed the GOP-led House earlier this year. The White House had signaled strong opposition to the bill but said Biden would sign it if it came across his desk. 3. Fungus Almost 100 confirmed or probable cases of a rare fungal infection known as blastomycosis have been linked to a Michigan paper mill, health officials say. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the CDC. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won't get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Nineteen cases have been linked with the Billerud Paper Mill in the town of Escanaba and another 74 are probable, meaning the person has symptoms. Typically, there are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, the CDC said. 4. Ukraine Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, in what Ukraine's top land commander calls ""scorched Earth"" tactics. Meanwhile, Ukraine is working to hold back Russian forces in the region, with more than 20 attacks repelled within 24 hours, according to Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces. Separately, the US State Department on Monday officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich as ""wrongfully detained"" by Russia. This designation will empower the US to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure his release. Gershkovich was detained in late March and formally charged with espionage last Friday. 5.

""His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras,"" the statement said. His apology comes after a video of the exchange, which took place in February, went viral on social media -- with many users criticizing the Dalai Lama's actions. Some of his supporters, on the other hand, argue the leader's actions have been misinterpreted under a Western lens.

                      Iowa's attorney general has paused funding for sexual assault victims' Plan B and abortions
                  ","
                      Iowa's Attorney General has paused funding for emergency contraception and abortions for sexual assault victims, according to an email Iowa's Coalition Against Sexual Assault received that was also shared with CNN. The email was sent from Chief Deputy Attorney General Sam Langholz. Attorney General Brenna Bird's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Langholz told the nonprofit that a review of victim's services is ongoing and the Attorney General has not made a final decision on whether the payments will resume.  ""While not required by Iowa law, the victim compensation fund has previously paid for Plan B and abortions. As a part of her top-down, bottom-up audit of victim assistance, Attorney General Bird is carefully evaluating whether this is an appropriate use of public funds,"" Bird's Press Secretary Alyssa Brouillet said in a statement to the Des Moines Register. ""Until that review is complete, payment of these pending claims will be delayed."" Langholz shared the same statement from Bird's press secretary in the email obtained by CNN.  Under the 1979 Iowa Sexual Abuse Examination Payment Program, victims of sexual assault in Iowa are ""never responsible for a sexual abuse forensic examination or for medications required due to the assault,"" according to Iowa's Victim Assistance annual report.  Though it was not explicitly required, it has been the state's longtime policy to cover the cost of emergency contraception under the victim compensation fund, and in rare cases, the fund has also paid for abortions for rape victims, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the victim assistance division under the previous attorney general, told the Des Moines Register. After Bird took office, Tibbetts Murphy resigned at request of the new attorney general, the Des Moines Register reported. Funds for the program are entirely made up of fines and penalties paid by convicted criminals, rather than general taxpayer money -- a point victim advocacy groups emphasize.  ""Victims of rape and child abuse have an acute need for timely access to health services, including contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy and abortion care. Cost should never be a barrier for rape victims seeking medical care,"" Iowa's Coalition Against Sexual Assault said in a statement Monday, urging the attorney general to continue the payments to sexual assault victims. ""Using offender accountability victim compensation funds to cover the cost of forensic exams, incentivizes victims to undergo an invasive exam that can help prevent offenders from victimizing others and enhance access to medical care for crime victims.""  Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called Bird's decision ""deplorable and reprehensible,"" saying it ""further demonstrates politicians' crusade against Iowans' health and rights,"" according to a statement.  Bird, a Republican, won her election in 2022 in a race that largely focused on abortion after her Democratic opponent declined to defend Iowa's ""fetal heartbeat"" law, which would ban most abortions after about six weeks.  During her campaign, Bird said, ""I am pro-life and I will defend the laws that are passed by the Legislature.""  Iowa's Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that ensuring victims are not responsible for the cost of a forensic exam or for needed medications after an assault is ""key to encouraging victims to undergo this extremely invasive medical exam as soon as possible after a violent assault."" Juveniles accounted for the majority of sexual abuse victim costs paid for by Iowa's state victim compensation funds, according to a 2021 Iowa's Victim Assistance report. Nearly 2.9 million women across the US experienced rape-related pregnancy during their lifetime, according to a study published in 2018 by the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.  ""Emergency contraception should be provided to victims of sexual assault, requiring its immediate availability in hospitals and other facilities where sexual assault victims are treated,"" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says on its website.

                      A punch in the face for Xi caricature: Taiwan air force badge goes viral
                  ","
                      Taiwanese are rushing to buy patches being worn by their air force pilots that depict a Formosan black bear punching Winnie the Pooh -- representing China's leader Xi Jinping -- as a defiant symbol of the island's resistance to Chinese military exercises. China began three days of military drills around Taiwan on Saturday, a day after the island's president, Tsai Ing-wen, returned from a brief visit to the United States, where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy despite Beijing's warnings. Chinese censors have long targeted representations of Winnie the Pooh -- created by British author A.A. Milne -- over internet memes that compare the fictional bear to China's leader. Alec Hsu, who designed the patch, has been selling it at his shop since last year, but he saw a spike in orders after Taiwan's military news agency on Saturday published a photo of the patch on the arm of a pilot inspecting a fighter jet. ""I wanted to boost the morale of our troops through designing this patch,"" said Hsu, who owns Wings Fan Goods Shop. Hsu said he has ordered more patches to meet the increased demand. Customers have included military officers and civilians. The patch shows an angry Formosan black bear holding Taiwan's flag and punching Winnie the Pooh, with the slogan ""Scramble!"" -- referring to what the island's pilots have had to do with increased frequency over the past three years as China sends more aircraft into Taiwan's air defense identification zone -- a self-declared buffer that extends beyond the island's airspace. The endangered Formosan black bear is seen as a symbol of Taiwanese identity. Taiwan was previously better known internationally as Formosa. ""Where can we get a patch like that! Guaranteed to be best sellers!"" Taiwan's de facto embassy in the United States wrote in a tweet on Monday. Taiwan's air force told Reuters that while it does not ""particularly encourage"" its members to wear the patch, which is not a part of their uniform, it ""will maintain an open attitude"" to anything that raises morale. China's Communist Party claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory despite never having controlled it and has not ruled out taking the island by force. Tsai's government rejects China's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future. While the Winnie the Pooh patch cannot be found on Chinese social media, Beijing has also been promoting videos and commentary about its drills around Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army Eastern Theatre Command, the Chinese unit that would be at the frontline of any military action against Taiwan, released a video on Monday showing scenes from the drill, set against upbeat music. The video targeted a Taiwanese audience by using traditional Chinese characters, which are still used in Taiwan but no longer in mainland China. Chinese military drills China's drills focused on practicing ""maritime blockades"" and ""targeted ambush assaults on enemy mooring vessels"" in the Taiwan Strait, as well as northwest, southwest and waters east of Taiwan, Chinese state media reported reported. Over the weekend, multiple PLA services had carried out ""simulated joint precision strikes on key targets on Taiwan Island"" and in the surrounding waters, state media reported. Analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said the PLA was ""practicing and probably refining the aerial coordination and joint operations required to initiate a blockade of Taiwan's ports and air lanes."" A Chinese blockade of Taiwan could choke off supplies coming into the island, including any military aid or other shipments from the United States or its partners. The US, through the Taiwan Relations Act, is legally obligated to provide Taiwan with defensive weaponry, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attempted Chinese attack. Beijing had repeatedly warned against Tsai's meeting with McCarthy and threatened to take ""strong and resolute measures"" if it went ahead. After the drills commenced, Beijing described them as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Taiwan Defense Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said the PLA's exercises had ""destabilized"" the region. ""President Tsai's visit became their excuse to conduct exercises and their actions have severely jeopardized the security of the surrounding region,"" he said, adding that the island's air defense units were on ""high alert."" Beijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island.

                      UN tells Afghan staff to stay home after Taliban bans women from working with the organization
                  ","
                      The United Nations said it was being forced into making an ""appalling choice"" after instructing all of its personnel in Afghanistan to stay away from its offices in the country, following the Taliban's ban on female Afghan aid workers. ""UN national personnel -- women and men -- have been instructed not to report to UN offices, with only limited and calibrated exceptions made for critical tasks,"" the organization said in a statement. It comes after Afghan men working for the UN in Kabul stayed home last week in solidarity with their female colleagues. The UN said the Taliban's move was an extension of a previous ban, enforced last December, that prohibited Afghan women from working for national and international non-governmental organizations. The decree forced the UN ""into having to make an appalling choice between staying and delivering in support of the Afghan people and standing by the norms and principles we are duty-bound to uphold,"" the organization said in a statement Tuesday. It added that the ban was ""the latest in a series of discriminatory measures implemented by the Taliban de facto authorities with the goal of severely restricting women and girls' participation in most areas of public and daily life in Afghanistan."" The UN will continue to ""assess the scope, parameters and consequences of the ban, and pause activities where impeded,"" the statement said, adding that the ""matter will be under constant review."" Several female UN staff in the country had already experienced restrictions on their movements since the Taliban seized power in 2021, including harassment and detention. Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN Deputy Special Representative, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, called the Taliban's decision an ""unparalleled violation of human rights"" last week. ""The lives of Afghanistan women are at stake,"" he said, adding, ""It is not possible to reach women without women."" The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, is engaging with the Taliban at the highest level to ""seek an immediate reversal of the order,"" the UN said last week. ""In the history of the United Nations, no other regime has ever tried to ban women from working for the Organization just because they are women. This decision represents an assault against women, the fundamental principles of the UN, and on international law,"" Otunbayeva said. Other figures within the organization also condemned the move, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calling it ""utterly despicable."" After the Taliban banned female aid workers in December, at least half a dozen major foreign aid groups temporarily suspended their operations in Afghanistan -- diminishing the already scarce resources available to a country in dire need of them. The Taliban's return to power preceded a deepening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, worsening issues that had long plagued the country. After the takeover, the US and its allies froze about $7 billion of the country's foreign reserves and cut off international funding -- crippling an economy heavily dependent on overseas aid.

                      Egyptian official rejects leaked intelligence suggesting nation's military was producing weapons for Russia
                  ","
                      A senior Egyptian official denied that the country's military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia, following reporting by the Washington Post citing a leaked US intelligence document, Egyptian state-affiliated media said. A leaked US intelligence document obtained by the Washington Post said Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West."" The February-dated ""top secret document"" purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials referencing plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, and to keep the plans a secret, the Washington Post said. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is unable to confirm its authenticity. The Egyptian official, unnamed by state-affiliated media, called the Washington Post report ""informational absurdity"" and said that Egypt follows a ""balanced policy"" with all international parties, Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet said. The statement was carried by several Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Egypt is one of the world's top recipients of US military aid, receiving $1.3 billion in military financing annually. The White House also said it has no indication Egypt is providing Russia with deadly arms.  John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, told reporters aboard Air Force One ""we've seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia.""  Kirby said Egypt remained ""a significant security partner"" and would remain so. ""The United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years,"" he said.  Russia's Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the information ""another hoax."" ""It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now. This is how you should treat such publications,"" Peskov said in response to a question from a reporter on the report. CNN reached out to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry for comment. Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. Egypt has publicly voiced muted opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It has supported United Nations resolutions condemning the war, including a call in February that Moscow ""immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine and called for a cessation of hostilities."" The country's economy has been damaged by the conflict, with Egypt relying heavily on grain exports from the two countries.

                      Juul settles lawsuit with West Virginia for $7.9 million
                  ","
                      West Virginia has settled a lawsuit with e-cigarette maker Juul Labs for a total of $7.9 million, the state's attorney general announced Monday. The company was accused of unfair, deceptive acts or practices in the advertising and marketing of Juul products in the state, specifically targeting teenagers. The lawsuit claimed Juul targeted these users through social media, influencer marketing and fashion bloggers and celebrities popular with teenagers.  ""This settlement puts companies like Juul in check to not copy big tobacco's playbook and gear marketing strategies toward underage people,"" West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said.  Morrisey said the court alleged Juul had ""deceived consumers about its nicotine strength, misrepresented the nicotine equivalency of its products to traditional cigarettes and understated the risks of addiction that occur with such powerful levels of nicotine."" The AG said 14.3% of West Virginia high schoolers used e-cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days, higher than the national average of 13.2%.  In a statement, a Juul company spokesperson said the settlement is ""another step in its ongoing commitment to resolve issues from the company's past."" Juul said terms of the agreement will go to ""financial resources to further combat underage use and develop cessation programs"" and is part of the current business practices implemented in 2019. ""With West Virginia having the highest cigarette-smoking rate in the U.S., we hope that some funds will go directly to interventions to reduce the use of combustible cigarettes and improve public health in the state,"" the company said. ""Juul Labs remains focused on... its mission to transition adult smokers away from cigarettes -- the number one cause of preventable death."" Last December, Juul Labs announced it settled more than 5,000 cases brought by approximately 10,000 plaintiffs in the US, resolving a substantial amount of legal issues for the company. The company said the cases were variously personal injury, consumer class action, or from government entity and Native American tribe groups, but did not disclose the settlement amount.  That followed a September announcement that Juul would pay $438.5 million to 34 states and territories after a two-year investigation into its marketing and sales practices -- like in West Virginia, Juul was charged with deliberately marketing its products to young people. At one point, Juul was selling some of the most popular vapes in the US, especially the flavored products which the company stopped selling in 2019.  Last summer, the FDA ordered Juul products to be removed from the US market. A court temporarily blocked the FDA ban, so products are still for sale in the United States.

                      Lawmakers seek details on 'unusually cozy' ties between tech executives and SVB
                  ","
                      Democratic lawmakers sent letters to 14 of the largest depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, seeking details about the lender's ""unusually cozy"" relationships with its well-heeled clients.  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sent the letters Sunday to executives at Roku, Roblox, Circle and BlockFi, among others, raising questions about their ""white glove"" treatment by SVB. Silicon Valley Bank was known to cater to the tech startup world. But Warren and Ocasio-Cortez, citing media reports, raised concerns about whether the bank's relationships went beyond industry standards and potentially hastened its collapse last month.  SVB reportedly provided lower-interest-rate mortgages for tech start-up founders whom other banks wouldn't lend to, according to the New York Times, while sponsoring industry ski trips, conferences, and fancy dinners, the lawmakers wrote. ""Silicon Valley Bank's unusually cozy relationship with its clients increased the threat of contagion when the bank went under,"" said Senator Warren in a statement. ""The American people deserve to know how these mutual backscratching arrangements developed, who benefited from them, and what role they played in Silicon Valley Bank's failure."" SVB became the second-largest bank failure in US history a month ago. State and federal regulators stepped in to shut the bank down a day after panicked depositors yanked their funds, drawing down $42 billion in the span of a single day.  The vast majority of the bank's deposits were uninsured, which makes the bank more vulnerable to a run. Depositors with less than $250,000 limit set by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are far less likely to draw down their money at the first sign of trouble.

                      Tupperware stock plunges after warning it could go out of business
                  ","
                      Tupperware shares fell nearly 50% Monday following a bleak warning that its future is looking murky. In a regulatory filing late Friday, the container maker said there's ""substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern,"" and that it's working with financial advisers to find financing to stay afloat. Tupperware said it won't have enough cash to fund its operations if it doesn't secure additional money. The company said it is exploring potential layoffs, and it's reviewing its real estate portfolio for potential money-saving efforts.  The New York Stock Exchange also warned that Tupperware's stock is in danger of being de-listed for not filing a required annual report. ""Tupperware has embarked on a journey to turn around our operations and today marks a critical step in addressing our capital and liquidity position,"" CEO Miguel Fernandez said in a press release. ""The company is doing everything in its power to mitigate the impacts of recent events, and we are taking immediate action to seek additional financing and address our financial position.""  The 77-year-old business has been struggling in recent years to maintain its relevance against rivals. It has been trying to shed its staid image and attract younger customers with newer and trendier products. It also struck a deal with Target last year to sell its products.  Several issues are hurting Tupperware, including a ""sharp decline in the number of sellers, a consumer pullback on home products, and a brand that still does not fully connect with younger consumers,"" according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. Saunders said Tupperware is in a ""precarious position"" financially because it's struggling to grow sales, and because it's asset-light it doesn't have ""much capacity to raise money."" ""The company used to be a hotbed of innovation with problem-solving kitchen gadgets, but it has really lost its edge,"" he said.  Tupperware said the entry into Target is part of the brand's reinvention, which includes plans to grow the business through multiple retail channels and get its products in front of younger consumers who've never even heard of Tupperware parties. But that has failed to work so far: Shares are down 90% over the past year. It also issued another ""going concern"" warning last November.

                      How long should you support your adult children? Parents — and their kids — weigh in
                  ","
                      Parents invest so much of themselves, emotionally and financially, in raising their children — but the time comes when a parent has to stop subsidizing their adult children's everyday expenses. Think housing, health insurance, car payments, cell phones, credit cards, subscription services, student loans and travel.  And, as it turns out, kids and parents don't agree on just when exactly that time should be.  A new survey from Bankrate found that Gen Z adults (between the ages of 18 and 26) think parents should slow their roll on when to stop paying for them. Take housing. Gen Z adults said they shouldn't have to start paying rent until age 23 on average. Baby Boomer and Gen X parents beg to differ, saying their kids should pony up starting at age 21. When it comes to cell phones and credit card bills, Gen Z thinks they should start paying for them by age 21. Their parents say age 19 would be better.  The Bankrate survey doesn't specify how many respondents are living with their parents or, conversely, their adult children. But it's a fair bet the percentage could be significant. In July 2022, the Pew Research Center found that half of adults ages 18 to 29 were living with at least one parent. The risk for parents of subsidizing adult children Of course, how a parent feels about the need for their child to pay their own bills and what a parent does may be two very different things. Nearly 7 in 10 parents with children 18 or older said they have made a financial sacrifice to help their grown-up kids, according to the survey. Thirty-one percent characterized that sacrifice as ""significant,"" while 37% said it was ""somewhat significant."" Sacrifice meant: Reducing their emergency savings (51%), impairing their ability to pay off their own debt (49%) or save for retirement (43%); and making it hard to reach some other financial milestone (55%). Low-income parents — defined as those making $50,000 or less a year — were most likely to say they have made financial sacrifices to help their adult children.  For instance, 58% of the lowest earners said they sacrificed their emergency savings compared to 46% of the highest earning households — defined as earning $100,000 or more a year. While it can be hard to say no to your adult offspring if they ask for, or simply expect, a financial assist, parents do themselves no favors if they subsidize them at the expense of their own financial security.  After all, not everyone is likely to backstop a parent who falls behind on housing payments, fails to create a sufficient financial cushion for retirement or who finds they can't afford medical care. ""Make sure the assistance [you give] works within your budget and be clear about the parameters,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior analyst at Bankrate. ""Helping out shouldn't be seen as a blank check or an indefinite handout. It might help to attach a specific dollar amount or time frame."" Bankrate's survey, conducted from March 14 to March 16, included responses from a nationally representative sampling of 2,346 US adults, of whom 773 were parents with children age 18 or older.

                      Webb telescope captures 'green monster' inside a young supernova
                  ","
                      The James Webb Space Telescope has spied colorful, never-before-seen details in one of the most well-observed remnants of an exploded star. The glowing gas and dust of Cassiopeia A is all that remains of a star that exploded in a supernova, and its light reached Earth for the first time 340 years ago. It's the youngest known supernova remnant in our galaxy, which is why the celestial object has been studied by a multitude of ground and space-based telescopes.  Cassiopeia A is located 11,000 light-years away in the Cassiopeia constellation, and the remnant stretches for 10 light-years. Insights from Cas A, as the remnant is also known, allow scientists to learn more about how stellar explosions occur.  Astronomers turned the Webb telescope and its instruments in the direction of Cas A to see if the observatory's infrared capabilities could pick up anything other telescopes have missed. Infrared light is invisible to the human eye, allowing Webb to spy otherwise invisible aspects of the universe. ""Cas A represents our best opportunity to look at the debris field of an exploded star and run a kind of stellar autopsy to understand what type of star was there beforehand and how that star exploded,"" said Danny Milisavljevic, assistant professor at Purdue University and principal investigator of the Webb program that captured the new observations, in a statement. ""Compared to previous infrared images, we see incredible detail that we haven't been able to access before,"" said co-investigator Tea Temim, research astronomer at Princeton University, in a statement. Webb's new infrared image of Cas A has been translated into visible light so the human eye can see the remnant's colors. Red and orange light on the remnant's exterior indicates warm dust, where material ejected from the star before it exploded is colliding with surrounding gas and dust. Inside the bubble-like structure of the remnant, bright pink light can be seen, along with features that resemble clumps and knots. This material came from the exploded star and includes glowing heavy elements like argon, neon and oxygen. A bright green loop along the right side of the bubble has also captured the interest of researchers. ""We've nicknamed it the Green Monster in honor of Fenway Park in Boston. If you look closely, you'll notice that it's pockmarked with what look like mini-bubbles,"" said Milisavljevic. ""The shape and complexity are unexpected and challenging to understand."" The team is still trying to understand the sources behind all of the different colors in the image. Studying remnants like Cas A can help scientists understand cosmic dust, a building block for stars and planets, and how exploded stars release elements crucial for life. ""By understanding the process of exploding stars, we're reading our own origin story,"" Milisavljevic said. ""I'm going to spend the rest of my career trying to understand what's in this data set.""

                      The Texas pardons board is investigating after GOP governor's request in case of sergeant convicted of killing protester at 2020 BLM rally
                  ","
                      The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is launching an investigation upon the Republican governor's request for an expedited probe and pardon recommendation for a US Army sergeant convicted Friday of killing a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020. ""The board will be commencing that investigation immediately"" and will report to the governor with recommendations when it's done, board spokesperson Rachel Alderete said Monday. The board didn't immediately say how long the inquiry could take or whether an appeal process is required ahead of a recommendation. Daniel Perry, the White Army sergeant and ride-share driver, was indicted on a charge of murder in 2021 for the fatal shooting of Garrett Foster, who is also White, at a Black Lives Matter protest in Austin, Texas. He was also charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and deadly conduct for his behavior at the protest. A Travis County jury on Friday convicted Perry, 35, of murder. The jury found him not guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and the deadly conduct charge is still pending with the county attorney's office. Gov. Greg Abbott was ""working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry,"" Abbott tweeted Saturday afternoon, explaining Texas law allows the governor to request the state's pardon board to determine if a pardon should be granted, and he'd ""made that request and instructed the Board to expedite its review."" Abbott also referenced Texas' ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which he called ""one of the strongest"" in the country. Such laws generally allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be. Perry's defense has argued he shot Foster in self-defense after Foster approached his car with an assault-style rifle. Perry was an active-duty sergeant working for a ride-share service to make extra money at the time of the killing, his lawyers have said. Perry had dropped off a client near the protest and did not know the event, which followed the in-custody death of Black father George Floyd, was taking place, his defense has said. He carried a handgun in his car for protection as a driver, according to his lawyers. The prosecution argued Perry initiated the encounter by running a red light to turn into the crowd gathered for the protest against police brutality and had previously posted on social media about shooting protesters, according to CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster, 28, died shortly after the shooting. Foster's mother, Sheila Foster, said her son was a Libertarian and had marched for ""50 straight days in the Texas summer heat against systemic racism.""  ""My son was marching because he believed in equality and in our Constitutional rights.  He was fighting the abuse of power. He did not deserve to die, and justice for my son should not be politicized,"" she said in a statement.  Perry's lawyer, Clint Broden, was disappointed with the verdict, he said. ""We are disappointed in the verdict both as it relates to Daniel Perry and as it relates to a citizen's ability to defend themselves,"" Broden told CNN on Saturday. ""Sgt. Perry will, of course, appeal the verdict and we are hopeful that the case will ultimately be overturned on appeal."" A judge on Monday is expected to set a sentencing hearing for Perry. Quentin Brogdon, a civil attorney for the Foster family, criticized Abbott's move for a pardon before the sentencing and the appeals process, saying it ""turns the rule of law on its head."" The 12 jurors in the case heard 40 witnesses and deliberated for 15 hours, and state and federal appeals courts are allowed to overturn the conviction ""if it is contrary to the rule of law,"" Brogdon said in a statement.  ""Nobody, including the Governor of the State of Texas should shut down that process, and any attempt to do so threatens the rule of law for all of us,"" Brogdon said.  Whitney Mitchell, Foster's longtime partner who was with Foster the night he was killed, said she was relieved to learn the verdict, but now feels she's living a ""nightmare"" again after the governor began pushing for a pardon. ""I just thought it was disgusting,"" she told CNN in an interview. ""I don't think that (Abbott) has fully, like, read the case or knows what's going on with it. And I honestly can't understand this decision."" Mitchell has been reliving the moment Foster died for three years, she said.  ""He was the love of my life. He took care of me. I grew up with him,"" she said. ""I don't know what to do. He's been gone for so long and I'm still trying to figure out what to do."" The pardon process ""is outside our control,"" Perry's attorney said in response to Abbott's tweet. Perry's legal team is focused on ""the upcoming sentencing hearing and marshaling evidence related to Sgt. Perry's character and his service to our country,"" he said. Travis County District Attorney José Garza called Abbott's comments that he would intervene in the case ""deeply troubling,"" and on Monday said that just by announcing his intention, Abbott had ""undermined the rule of law in the state of Texas, and he has made our community less safe."" ""Every single day here in Travis County, we hold people accountable who commit acts of gun violence,"" Garza told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. ""We are going to continue to hold people accountable who commit acts of gun violence, and obviously, if the governor wants to continue to pardon people who commit acts of gun violence, that's up to him, but there is no doubt in my mind that it makes our community less safe,"" Garza said.  Garza said he is also thinking about Foster's parents and fiancée, who are ""heartbroken right now."" ""They waited so long to have their moment in court. They waited so long for justice for their son, and justice, I think, feels so elusive to them right know,"" he said.  ""I want them to know that the Travis County District Attorney's Office is going to continue to fight for a criminal justice system where everyone is treated equally, including Garrett Foster,"" the prosecutor said.

                      Italian Coast Guard escorting 1,200 migrants on boats in Mediterranean Sea
                  ","
                      The Italian Coast Guard was on Tuesday escorting two boats carrying 1,200 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, as part of a major operation in a region that has seen migrant arrivals spike in the past year.  Emergency workers were racing to rescue a barge with 400 migrants onboard that had ran out of fuel, according to the volunteer-run service Alarm Phone. The Coast Guard told CNN later Monday that it is also escorting another vessel carrying 800 migrants. ""Due to the prohibitive sea conditions, the Peluso ship, the Diciotti ship and the Coast Guard patrol boats are escorting the two units, in difficulty since yesterday, with migrants on board,"" the Coast Guard said on Twitter. ""The ships, carrying 400 and 800 migrants, got into trouble in rough seas on Monday."" Alarm Phone said in a tweet earlier that it had spoken to passengers at 10.56 a.m. local time (4.56 a.m. ET), describing the situation on board as ""dramatic,"" with the boat starting to leak. ""They report several medical emergencies, water filling the vessel and no fuel left. We have informed the authorities,"" Alarm phone said.  The coast guard is traveling next to the boat en route to Italy because an escort is ""safer"" than attempting to rescue those on board in poor weather, said Felix Weiss, a spokesman for Sea-Watch International, a German organization that runs search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.    The migrants had been stranded along an immigration route between Italy and Malta that NGOs have warned is perilously dangerous. The boat with 400 migrants departed from Tobruk, Libya, and had been at risk of capsizing with water in the hull, according to Alarm Phone. The service also said many on board required medical attention, including a child, a pregnant woman and a disabled person.  The Italian Coast Guard also said Monday that more than 1,700 migrants had arrived on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa in the last 48 hours. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, is a major destination for migrants seeking to enter European Union countries. Every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution and poverty risk the treacherous route in search of safety and better economic prospects. In many cases, their vessels are overcrowded and unfit for the journey, and the need to rescue migrants on board often leads to disputes between countries about who should take them in. More than 28,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, according to the country's Interior Ministry -- a significant surge compared to recent years. The number of migrants arriving in Italy this year are the highest seen in the country since 2017, according to figures by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Most arrivals have journeyed from the Ivory Coast, Guinea, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Pakistan.

                      Two police officers and another person were killed in an exchange of gunfire during a traffic stop in northwestern Wisconsin on Saturday, authorities said. The gunfire erupted after an officer from the Chetek Police Department conducted a traffic stop in Cameron around 3:38 p.m. local time, according to a news release from the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Notified of ""concerning behavior,"" the officers were conducting the stop based on a warrant and to check the welfare of the driver, 50-year-old Glenn Douglas Perry. The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday identified the two officers as Chetek Police Officer Emily Breidenbach, 32, and Cameron Police Officer Hunter Scheel, 23. Perry was taken to a hospital and was later also pronounced dead, the news release said. The Wisconsin Department of Justice earlier said it is investigating the incident.  The department's Division of Criminal Investigation ""is continuing to review evidence and determine the facts of this incident and will turn over investigative reports to the Barron County District Attorney when the investigation concludes,"" the news release said.  The village of Cameron is in the northwestern part of the state, about 51 miles north of the city of Eau Claire.

                      Around 100 people, including women and children, have been killed after Myanmar's military junta bombed the Kant Balu township in the Sagaing region on Tuesday, according to the shadow government of the ousted administration. The attack resulted in the ""loss of scores of innocent civilians and injuring many more, including children and pregnant women,"" the National Unity Government (NUG)'s Ministry of Labour said in a statement, describing it as a ""heinous act"" that constitutes ""a war crime.""  Local news outlet The Irrawaddy reported that a junta aircraft dropped two bombs and fired on the village while people were gathered for the opening of a new town office.  The military junta has not yet commented publicly on the alleged attack. CNN has reached out to a military junta spokesperson, but not yet heard back.  Photos and videos shared by The Irrawaddy and other local media show bodies of victims, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris after the air raid. CNN has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos.  The Union Prime Minister of the NUG Mahn Winn Khine Thann said on Twitter he was ""heartbroken"" by the ""aerial massacre."" Thousands of people have been killed across Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021. The junta ousted democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was later sentenced to 33 years in jail during secretive trials. It has cracked down on anti-coup protests, arrested journalists and political prisoners, and executed several leading pro-democracy activists, drawing condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups. Two years on, the Southeast Asian country is being rocked by violence and instability. The economy has collapsed, with shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The US last month placed a fresh series of sanctions on two people with alleged ties to the military and three businesses owned by them, a statement from the State Department said.

                      See where abortions are banned and legal — and where it's still in limbo
                  ","
                      Following the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, more than a dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to the procedure.  Nine states, including Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri, have banned abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Mississippi's near-total ban has an exception for rape but not incest. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity. Health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced. In South Carolina, the state's Supreme Court overturned a six-week ban in January 2023, concluding in a 3-2 decision that the law violated the state constitution's privacy protections. Georgia's six-week ban was blocked in November by a state court, but days later, Georgia's Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect while an appeal by the state plays out. The state's Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case in March, and a ruling is expected in the next six months. A district judge in Wyoming also temporarily blocked the state's new abortion ban days after it went into effect in March, meaning abortion remains legal until viability for now. As these legal challenges make their way through the courts, patients seeking access to the procedure must navigate a complicated patchwork of legislation, often requiring them to travel hundreds of miles.

                      Did this winter solve the Colorado River crisis? No -- but it took some pressure off, for now
                  ","
                      Across the Southwest, the signs of a phenomenal winter are everywhere. Snow blankets the tops of the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. And in downtown Phoenix, the Salt and Verde rivers are full.  After three years of record-breaking drought and plummeting water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, water officials and experts across the West are now looking at more snow and water than they can handle.   While many are not ready to declare the crisis on the Colorado River solved, they feel the blockbuster winter means basin states should no longer have to cut up to 25% of the basin's water usage that was called for last year by Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, the river's top federal official.  ""We can probably create the protection levels with cuts not as big as what she described,"" Arizona's top water official Tom Buschatzke told CNN. ""I think that might help us get to the place we need to be.""  After more than a year of contentious negotiations between Arizona, California and other Western states on how exactly to distribute those cuts, Buschatzke and other officials say the wet winter has taken some of the pressure off.  On Tuesday, the Interior Department and Bureau of Reclamation are expected to release the first installment of an environmental analysis examining what different volumes of Colorado River cuts will look like for the cities, farmers and tribes who all depend on the water.   The wet winter likely won't be reflected in Reclamation's analysis, according to Bill Hasencamp, the manager of Colorado River Resources for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to Los Angeles.   ""People in the upper basin are dealing with feet and feet and feet of snow. The snowpack is still increasing,"" Hasencamp told CNN. ""It's a completely different trend than we've seen the last three years. This is definitely going to make a huge difference in the short run. But people don't want to go too far because they don't want to go back to complacency.""  Still, others are cautioning that one historic winter will only delay the inevitable pain of water cuts, as years of overuse collide with climate change-fueled droughts.  As welcome as the reprieve this winter is, if water usage isn't cut by up to 25%, ""we will crash that system,"" said Cynthia Campbell, water resources management adviser for the city of Phoenix, told CNN. ""I think we're going to come right back to that conclusion in a year -- in a very short amount of time.""  Biden administration takes water-saving action  Even with the possible short-term reprieve from this winter's snowpack, the Biden administration is readying a flurry of Colorado River announcements as it scrambles to deal with a fast-growing crisis in the Western US.  On Tuesday, the federal government's highly anticipated analysis will compare several scenarios on the Colorado River -- comparing taking no action with other water-cutting scenarios of various degrees. The Biden administration is expected to select a preferred scenario this summer.  But the administration is also hoping to incentivize water cuts by paying cities, tribes and farmers to reduce water use for the next few years.   Last week, administration officials announced the first deal it signed in a series of short-term agreements to fallow farmland and keep more water in Lake Mead. The Gila River Indian Community in Arizona promised to conserve 125,000 acre-feet -- about 40 billion gallons -- of Colorado River water for the next three years. In exchange, the federal government agreed to pay for $233 million worth of water infrastructure and conservation projects for the tribe.  At a news conference at Arizona's state capital on Thursday, Deputy Interior Secretary Tommy Beaudreau told reporters more fallowing agreements would be coming soon.   ""What you're going to see in the coming months are additional announcements of deploying and awarding [federal] funding to communities throughout the basin in order to conserve water,"" Beaudreau said -- adding funding would also go to longer-term projects to cut water use in the West, such as water recycling and drip irrigation. ""You're going to see a steady drumbeat of that.""  Federal and state officials are hoping that the short-term payments to let agricultural fields go dry could add 10 additional feet of elevation in Lake Mead -- the Colorado River's largest reservoir and the largest reservoir in the country overall.   But whether 10 feet is achievable remains to be seen; many of these agreements have yet to be signed and are flexible enough to give farmers and cities the chance to back out if dry conditions return and they need the water, one source familiar with the agreements told CNN.   Tougher water fights to come The 25% cuts Touton called for last year spurred a tough series of state negotiations that yielded little consensus. Sticking points have included whether the senior priority rights that protect California and Arizona farmers and tribes from cuts should remain intact.   Stakeholders around the basin are expecting more tough negotiations to take place in 2026, when the current guidelines that govern how the river is managed are set to expire.  Many state water negotiators are breathing a sigh of relief the wet winter and short-term fallowing agreements are coinciding this year.   ""What we expect that means is that Lake Powell and Lake Mead will balance,"" Brenda Burman, general manager of the Central Arizona Project and former Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, told CNN. ""That helps with what type of shortage we might have next year, that helps as far as where we think the reservoirs might be in two to three years, so it's very good news.""  Still, Burman cautioned that since 2000, the Colorado River hasn't seen two years of good hydrology in a row -- meaning celebrations could be short-lived.  ""Even though this year is looking like a very good year for runoff; one, we haven't seen it yet, and two, we don't know what will happen next year,"" Burman said.  Along the Colorado River, all eyes are on the federal government's forthcoming announcement of what different water cut scenarios could look like. In the meantime, Colorado Basin state negotiators are starting to look more toward 2026, increasingly confident the good year of winter and water will help them avoid dire cuts in the short-term.   ""We don't want to be fighting over the short term and miss the real prize, which is the long term,"" Hasencamp told CNN.   One outside expert watching negotiations told CNN the talk about not having to make hard choices now is concerning, given how close the river has already come to crashing.  ""Perhaps more worrisome is the fact it buys us time,"" said Sarah Porter, the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. ""We have already come very close to minimum power pool and we're now able to say the words dead pool. We need a negotiated agreement or a federal action to get us out of this zone.""

                  ","
                      Three unions representing about 9,000 Rutgers University faculty and staff have gone on strike after nearly a year of gridlocked contract negotiations, marking the first educator strike in the university's nearly 257-year history, according to the unions.  Picket lines are expected to continue Tuesday on Rutgers's three main campuses in New Brunswick, Newark and Camden, New Jersey, to demand salary increases, improved job security for adjunct faculty and guaranteed funding for graduate students, among other requests. After New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy implored the two parties to meet in his office Monday for a ""productive dialogue,"" representatives for the governor's office, university and unions met around noon Monday and were still engaged in negotiations late Monday night, according to Alan Maass, a spokesperson for the union Rutgers AAUP-AFT. In response to a question about raising tuition to support contract demands, Murphy said during a Monday press conference that he would not be a fan of a deal ""that takes it out on the back of the students.""   ""I'm not happy it's gotten to this point. I said this to them -- both sides,"" the governor said, noting he is optimistic that all parties will reach a fair resolution.  Union leaders expected the action to halt instruction and ""non-critical research,"" as clinicians at the university's health facilities ""will continue to perform patient care duties and critical research, while curbing voluntary work,"" the unions' release said.  Still, the university has insisted classes will proceed. ""The university is open and operating, and classes are proceeding on a normal schedule,"" the school's website read late Monday, though another page noted: ""Many classes will continue to meet during the strike."" In guidelines posted in case of a strike, the university advised students to continue to attend classes and complete assignments as normal. It also stressed ""it is the university's expectation that all faculty and staff continue to report to work in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities."" The unions' action comes just weeks after a massive three-day strike by Los Angeles public school workers demanding increased wages and better working conditions and amid a surge of short-term worker strikes nationwide.  It is unclear how long the strike at Rutgers will last.  The university said it may seek a court injunction to end the strike and ""compel a return to normal activities,"" though union leaders have strongly resisted the university's claims that the strike is illegal.   ""To say that this is deeply disappointing would be an understatement,"" Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway said in a letter to the community, noting the two sides agreed to appoint a mediator just two days before the strike was announced.  ""For the past several weeks, negotiations have been constant and continuous,"" the president said. ""Significant and substantial progress has been made, as I have noted, and I believe that there are only a few outstanding issues. We will, of course, negotiate for as long as it takes to reach agreements and will not engage in personal attacks or misinformation."" Union representatives, however, insist the university has refused to meet their central demands.  ""After sitting at the bargaining table for 10 months trying to win what we believe to be fair and reasonable things, like fair pay, job security, and access to affordable health care, and getting virtually nowhere on these core demands, we had no choice but to vote to strike,"" Amy Higer, a part-time lecturer at Rutgers and president of the Adjunct Faculty Union, said in a statement. ""We've heard management say that a strike will harm students,"" she continued. ""But you know what really harms students? The high turnover that results from paying teachers poorly and making them reapply for their jobs every semester."" The striking unions are Rutgers AAUP-AFT, which represents full-time faculty, graduate workers, postdoctoral researchers and counselors; the Rutgers Adjunct Faculty Union, which represents part-time lecturers; and AAUP-BHSNJ, which represents faculty who teach at the university's medical and public health facilities. Nine other unions are seeking new contracts with the university, according to the unions' release.  Where negotiations stand  The unions and university representatives have been negotiating since the prior contracts expired last summer, the unions' release said. But while both sides acknowledged some progress in recent days, union leadership said Sunday that their essential demands were still far from being met.  Rutgers AAUP-AFT and AAUP-BHSNJ have united their bargaining efforts and are jointly negotiating a single contract for all full-time university faculty, while the Adjunct Faculty Union is independently negotiating a new contract for part-time lecturers who must be reappointed to their teaching positions after a set number of semesters or years.  Here are some of the unions' demands: AAUP-AFT and AAUP-BHSNJ • A university-sponsored affordable housing program and freeze of campus housing rates  • Salary increases for full-time faculty, graduate and postdoctoral workers   • Increased protections for immigrant and international workers  • Up to five years of guaranteed funding for graduate workers  • Child care subsidies for graduate and postdoctoral workers  • More paths to teaching tenure for professors and librarians  Adjunct Faculty Union • Health care eligibility for members who teach 50% of the full-time equivalent  • Longer-term contracts and more advance notification of appointments  • Caps on size of writing-intensive classes   • Promotions based on years of service  In response, Holloway said the university has offered, in part: • 12% salary increases for full-time faculty by July 2025 • Approximately 20% increase in per-credit salary rate for part-time lecturers • More than 20% increase in minimum salary for postdoctoral fellows and associates over the contract period • Commitment to ""multi-year university support"" for teaching and graduate assistants ""To say it's just about wages is an understatement,"" O'Malley, the masters student, said Sunday. ""This fight is the fight between our university's mission, between its promises and its reality. This is why this fight is central to students and community."" University threatens legal action  Faced with a possible strike, Holloway said in a letter last week that the action would leave leadership with ""no choice but to make every legal effort to ensure that any job action does not affect our students' academic progress."" In its posted strike guidance for faculty, staff and students, Rutgers said it would consider seeking a court injunction to force a return to instruction and work.  ""The university may go to court to maintain university operations and protect our students, patients, and staff from disruptions to their education, clinical care, and workplace,"" the guidance said.  The university and union leaders are at odds over the legality of the strike, as Rutgers has warned its workers that it would be illegal for them to participate in the action as public employees. In a note advising participants on their ""right to strike,"" the unions pushed back on the university's claim, saying, ""The NJ Constitution and statutes are silent about whether strikes by public-sector workers are legal. In some instances, courts have issued injunctions against striking public employees."" If Rutgers administrators do petition a court for an injunction, the unions said, ""It would signal the start, and not the end, of a legal process.""

                      Sandstorm hits Beijing and northern China for the fourth time in a month
                  ","
                      A severe sandstorm has cloaked Beijing and China's northeastern regions for the fourth time in a month forcing some residents to stay indoors to protect themselves from dense air pollution. Images showed the Chinese capital engulfed in a cloud of orange haze on Monday which hung thick in the air into Tuesday, though conditions have begun to ease. Beijing authorities told children and the elderly to stay indoors, and healthy adults were advised to refrain from outdoor activity. Residents were also reminded to keep their windows shut and wear masks and face shields. On Monday, the air quality index soared to ""severely polluted"" levels, according to Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.  Concentrations of PM10 particles exceeded 1,321 micrograms per cubic meter at 9 p.m. on Monday, according to the center -- almost 30 times the daily average guideline of 45 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.  PM10 are particles of pollution that are less than 10 micrometers in diameter and can irritate your eyes and nose and travel to your lungs.  Even smaller particles referred to as PM2.5 can travel deeper into your lungs and potentially enter your bloodstream. Levels of PM2.5 have been ""hazardous"" in Beijing for some of the past 48 hours, according to the Air Quality Index, which monitors real-time air quality in major cities worldwide. Beijing is regularly hit with sandstorms in the spring with the smog made worse by rising industrial activity and rapid deforestation throughout northern China. The latest sandstorm is the fourth to hit the country since March 10, and the eighth since the start of the year, state media reported. The most severe sandstorm so far this year occurred on March 22, when PM10 particles hit 1,667 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.   This time, the affected areas stretched as far south as Shanghai to parts of Heilongjiang, the country's northernmost province, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. Other areas affected included Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia,  Shanxi, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and Hubei, according to the national observatory.  China's National and Grassland Administration said sand and dust from the southern part of Mongolia and the western part of Inner Mongolia were carried southeast by air currents, triggering the present storm.  One Chinese internet user on Weibo, China's heavily censored equivalent of Twitter, complained about the pungent smell.  ""It smells very earthy,"" she said.  Another user compared the storm to the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner"" and urged others to ""just wear protection"" when going out.

                      5 things to know for April 10: Document leaks, Mosque stabbing, Abortion, EVs, Masters
                  ","
                      Amid many pressing political duties, the Biden administration will make time today for an annual tradition dating to the 1870s: the White House Easter Egg Roll. About 30,000 visitors are expected to converge on the South Lawn for family-friendly activities centered around the theme of ""EGGucation."" Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""CNN's 5 Things"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Document leaks The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the leaks of a trove of apparent US intelligence documents that were posted on social media in recent weeks. The documents have revealed the US' efforts in spying on Russia, while also exposing the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. The documents appeared last month on the social media platform Discord and revealed sensitive and highly classified material, officials said. They also divulged weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry -- reportedly forcing the country's military to alter some plans as fighting continues in the country's eastern region. The Pentagon has initiated an ""interagency effort"" to determine the source of the leaks and assess their impact, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Sunday. 2. Mosque stabbing An imam is in stable condition after being stabbed during a Sunday morning prayer service at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, according to local officials. The suspect, who was unknown to congregants, was performing prayers at Omar Mosque when he lunged forward with a knife at the imam. After stabbing him multiple times, the suspect attempted to flee but the congregants ""were able to bring him down and apprehend him and hold him"" until police arrived and arrested him, a spokesperson for the mosque told CNN. There were more than 200 congregants in the mosque at the time of the stabbing, the spokesperson said, adding he believes that this was an isolated incident. The stabbing occurred during Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2023, it runs from March 22 to April 20. 3. Abortion Two federal court rulings over abortion access are creating a chaotic legal flashpoint that will be closely watched this week. In one case filed by anti-abortion activists in Texas, a judge said the FDA's approval more than 20 years ago of mifepristone -- one of the drugs used to terminate a pregnancy -- should be halted. But the court paused its ruling for a week so that it can be appealed. In the second case, where Democratic-led states had sued in Washington to expand access to abortion pills, a judge ordered the federal government to keep the drug available in the 17 states, plus the District of Columbia. ""Everything is on the table,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told CNN on Sunday, emphasizing the Biden administration is considering all options to protect access to the procedure.  4. Electric vehicles The EPA is preparing to release strict vehicle emissions standards for light-duty vehicles that, if implemented, would move the US car market decisively toward electric vehicles over the next decade. By 2032, the new emissions standards would ensure that 64% to 67% of all new-car sales in the US would be electric vehicles, according to a source familiar with the proposal. The EPA's expected move comes after California air regulators voted last year to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and set interim targets to phase these cars out. Experts say this is a major step toward zero-emissions vehicles as the US tries to keep up with other countries racing toward EV adoption. The new rules could come as soon as Wednesday. 5. Masters Jon Rahm won the 2023 Masters Tournament on Sunday at Augusta National Golf Club, clinching his first green jacket and second career major. The Spaniard's impressive victory saw him leapfrog reigning Masters champion Scottie Scheffler as world No. 1. Rahm put on a clinic in consistency to ease to a four-shot victory ahead of LIV Golf Series duo Brooks Koepka and Phil Mickelson. Fifteen-time major champion Tiger Woods announced his withdrawal due to injury hours before play resumed on Sunday after visibly struggling with movement throughout the weekend. Ultimately, Rahm carded a final round three-under 69 to finish 12-under. He became the fourth Spaniard to win the green jacket and the first European golfer to win both The Masters and the US Open.

                      An Alaska man receives a heart transplant after missing his first opportunity due to severe weather
                  ","
                      More than three months after Patrick Holland's first shot at getting a heart transplant was ruined by winter weather that upended his travel and prevented him from getting to the Washington state hospital in time, the Alaska man has been given a second chance.  The father of seven is among the thousands of people in the Pacific Northwest whose flights were canceled or redirected in December as severe storms swept through the region. But even after his airline jumped through hoops to reschedule Holland on subsequent flights, they were all canceled. The heart transplant was given to somebody else.  Determined to not miss his next opportunity, Holland temporarily relocated from his home near Fairbanks to live near the transplant hospital in Seattle so he could be available at a moment's notice. There, he was staying with a family who heard about his story on the news.  In the passing months, a few hearts became available for Holland, who has congestive heart failure, but none of them was viable.  Finally, a fifth call came last week alerting Holland to a potential transplant, and everything fell into place. ""It really didn't feel real until he told me, 'They told me I have like 20 minutes to say goodbye because we're going in for intubation,' and then a nurse came into the room, and he had to hang up,"" Holland's wife, Haley Holland, told CNN. When her husband called back, the couple had just seconds to speak before he had to go again. ""I barely had time to tell him that I loved him,"" said Holland, who has been documenting the family's transplant journey on Facebook. She and her children flew to Seattle to be with Patrick after the surgery last Friday. Haley Holland has been giving each potential donor, whose names are not typically shared with their organ recipients, an imagined name of her own.  Her husband is now recovering at the University of Washington Medical Center with a heart transplant from the donor she has dubbed ""Andrew.""  ""Number five --  Andrew, as we affectionately call this donor unless we become blessed enough to find out his true name -- was the perfect one,"" Haley Holland wrote in a Facebook post. In the days since the transplant, Haley Holland has felt and listened to her husband's new heartbeat. ""It feels like a miracle,"" she told CNN, adding that with the help of a nurse, she first felt her husband's new heartbeat through a pulse on his foot. On Saturday, she used a stethoscope to hear the beating.  ""It just makes you cry because this isn't the heart that he was born with. It's not the heart that he spent 57 years with. This is someone else's heart. And so it's very touching and it's miraculous that Patrick now has this new heart that he'll be able to enjoy life with."" Though the surgery was successful, Patrick Holland's recovery is just beginning. In a Tuesday Facebook update, his wife said he has been able to stand but still has uncomfortable IV ports and extreme he nausea that is making eating difficult. By Thursday, Holland was progressing in his recovery, according to Dr. Claudius Mahr, his cardiologist at the UW Medicine Heart Institute. ""He's pretty much progressing as one would expect,"" Mahr told CNN. ""There's always a few bumps in the road with surgeries like this, but he's generally trending in the right direction.""   Mahr said Alaska is one of several states without a heart transplant program, and patients often come to Washington for care. Doctors at the UW Medicine perform among the highest volume of heart transplants in the country, according to the hospital's website.  Following the surgery, Haley Holland created a GoFundMe to support the family's expenses. Her thoughts have also been with his heart donor. ""Remembering that this is Andrew's heart and that someone had to pay the ultimate price,"" she said. ""Someone had to wmake an enormous sacrifice in order for this miracle to happen. So, it's a very emotional thing, feeling the pulse or listening to the heart."" Patrick Holland told CNN in December that he had a ""massive heart attack at 29"" followed by a series of heart-related complications. He said he dreamed of keeping up with his children, who then ranged in age from 3 to 36.  Following the transplant, Haley Holland said her husband is thankful. ""Even in the worst times he will look at me and he'll say, 'It was worth it,'"" she said. As of January, 3,365 patients were on the waiting list for a heart nationwide, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. Mahr urged people to become organ donors. ""You can save multiple people's lives.""  Correction: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the volume of heart transplants UW Medicine performs. It is among the highest in the US.

                      New Jersey imam in stable condition after being stabbed during morning prayer service, local officials say
                  ","
                      An imam is in stable condition after being stabbed during a Sunday morning prayer service at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, according to local officials. Imam Sayed Elnakib was stabbed during the first prayer of the day, around 5:30 a.m., at Omar Mosque in south Paterson while the congregation was kneeling for prayer, mosque spokesperson Abdul Hamdan told CNN.  The suspect, who was unknown to congregants prior to Sunday's incident, was performing prayers and ""lunged forward with a knife and stabbed Imam Sayed multiple times -- at least twice,"" Hamdan said. After the incident, the suspect attempted to flee from the mosque but congregants ""were able to bring him down and apprehend him and hold him"" until police arrived and arrested him, he said. There were more than 200 congregants in the mosque at the time of the stabbing, Hamdan said. The spokesperson said he strongly believes that this was an isolated incident and assured all congregants ""that the mosque is safe and to practice their faith, it is open."" Mayor Andre Sayegh said he visited Imam Sayed Elnakib in the hospital soon after the incident. The mayor said the imam is in stable condition at St. Joseph's University Medical Center.  CNN has contacted the medical center and did not receive an immediate response. Sayegh said Elnakib was ""in better spirits than before"" Sunday afternoon and is being treated for a punctured lung. The mayor said a suspect was detained, but their motive is not clear. The stabbing occurred during Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2023, it runs from March 22 to April 20.  In a news conference Sunday, Sayegh commended the efforts of worshipers who apprehended the attacker and announced that there would be increased police presence at Paterson mosques. ""We appreciate the efforts of those here who were able to apprehend the assailant and we also want to reassure the family, the congregation at the mosque, that there will be extra police attention,"" the mayor said.  ""This is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar year and we want to make sure that the safety of those that are just coming to pray is a priority for us and that we take this situation very seriously,"" he continued. ""We want to let anyone who is coming to worship know that they can do this in peace without any fear of being attacked."" The Paterson Police Department was taken over by the state attorney general's office in late March, due to a ""crisis of confidence"" in the city's law enforcement, the office said at the time. The attorney general's office told CNN the stabbing is being investigated by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for further details. Councilman Al Abdel-aziz, who represents the area where the attack happened, said in a Facebook update that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the stabbing. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by this tragic event,"" he said. ""While it is unclear what motivated the attacker, there is no justification for violence of any kind, especially in a sacred space."" ""I am relieved to hear that Imam Sayed Elnakib is in stable condition, and wish him a full and speedy recovery,"" the councilman added. ""Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time. As a community, it is important that we come together to support one another and denounce all forms of hate and violence."" A day earlier, the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for a hate crime investigation after a separate incident in Paterson. The chapter said a sign at the Dr. Hani Awadallah public school in Paterson was defaced. In a statement Saturday, the chapter's executive director. Selaedin Maksut, said, ""While the circumstances surrounding the incident remain unknown, the smearing of the word 'Allah' in Dr. Awadallah's name is apparently intentional, with the remainder of the sign left untouched, making an immediate hate crime investigation into this incident necessary."" ""In 2022, we've recorded the highest number of complaints of anti-Muslim prejudices, at 152,"" Maksut said. ""Over the years, our records have shown that complaints increase around and during Ramadan, in part because Muslims are more visible and take up more space -- physically and metaphorically.""  During the month of Ramadan, worshipers eat and hydrate before sunrise and fast until sunset. Worshipers also engage in other forms of practice including increased prayer, giving more to charity, volunteering and participating in communal meals. Paterson is a city with a population of more than 150,000, according to the US Census Bureau, about 15 miles north of Newark.  The city is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the state of New Jersey and that New Jersey has more Muslims per capita than any other state in the nation, according to Maksut. Later Sunday, Hamdan performed the second prayer of the day at Omar Mosque, he said, along with 300 to 400 other worshipers. Prayers will continue throughout Sunday and moving forward, the spokesperson added. ""We urge everyone to allow this incident to even get them closer to their religion, to God, to visit the congregation more often and not allow this to bring them away,"" Hamdan said. ""This is a time of unity and peace, and this incident should not in any way take that away from us. We feel safe here at the mosque.""

                      OPEC's surprise production cut complicates the Fed's fight against inflation
                  ","
                      A surprise production cut announcement this week from Saudi Arabia and several other OPEC+ oil producers complicates the Federal Reserve's mission to cool the economy and could worsen inflation in the United States, economists say.  Energy prices across the globe surged last year when Russia invaded Ukraine, fueling global inflation just as the world's major economies were beginning to rebalance after the pandemic. Since then, a drop in energy prices has helped cool US inflation, which has fallen from a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June to 6% in February, year over year, according to the Consumer Price Index.  Energy prices, which make up around 7.5% of the overall index, were up 5% in February from the same month a year ago, well below the 41.3% rise last June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Now, with oil prices surging once again, headline inflation could remain elevated for longer or even rise. And Americans are already paying more at the pump — the national per-gallon average stood at $3.55 on Thursday, according to AAA, up from $3.40 a month ago. Even core inflation could be affected While Fed officials consider multiple economic metrics in order to inform their decision making, one of their main points of focus is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. However, higher oil prices can eventually push up core prices if they remain elevated for long enough. ""The Fed sees OPEC decisions as mostly geopolitical, but they can impact production of goods and the transportation of other items, so those higher oil prices can bleed into that core component, which the Fed does tend to focus on a little bit more in terms of setting policy,"" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN. Plastic resin, for example, is a derivative of crude oil used to create everyday items such as bottles, wires, and clothes. The cost of jet fuel closely influences airfare prices. Consumer spending plays a key role Higher energy costs soften overall demand by weighing on consumer sentiment and consumer spending, both of which were surprisingly robust at the beginning of the year but have recently started to cool.  Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan fell to its lowest point on record last June when gas prices reached $5 a gallon. It has since improved with the decline of gasoline prices. ""Energy prices are a very powerful factor in people's expectations of inflation, but right now, they're not having that hold on consumer psychology yet,"" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corporation. ""If the price of a gallon of regular gasoline goes above $4, then that's a different story,"" he said. But weaker consumer spending could be a mixed bag in terms of inflation, said John Leer, chief economist at data analytics firm Morning Consult. While it can reduce inflationary pressure for service-providing businesses, it can also increase the odds of the United States going into a recession. ""If consumers are allocating a greater share of their wallet to energy expenses, that's going to limit their ability to spend money elsewhere, so on a real basis, you would see demand contract that way,"" Leer said. Ultimately, the volatility of oil prices mean they are just too difficult to track, said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in an interview with Bloomberg. However, he acknowledged the eventual impact of higher prices. ""Some of that might feed into inflation and make our job a little bit more difficult,"" he said.

                      Snoop Dogg, his ape and a question of celebrity hype
                  ","
                      The question of whether Snoop Dogg deeply and sincerely liked some cartoon apes has become key in a federal lawsuit between the crypto empire Yuga Labs and the trollish artist Ryder Ripps.   Yuga Labs v. Ripps is a fight over trademarks, but legal filings in the case are pulling back the curtain on the year of mania around the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of cartoon apes.  The Bored Apes became some of the most famous NFTs after a series of celebrities said they got one. Snoop — not a plaintiff or defendant in the case — was one of the most famous and vocal owners of an ape. But Ripps' team says Snoop's love of the apes was not genuine, but bought and paid for by Yuga Labs — and federal regulations require celebs to disclose paid endorsements. Court documents filed by Ripps' lawyers claim Snoop was paid ""around $1 million"" to perform as a Bored Ape at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2022. The rapper did not disclose the payment in conjunction with his performance. Representatives for MTV did not respond to CNN's questions about Snoop's compensation for the appearance.  Celebrity-paid promos were part of the success of the broader crypto industry too, as revealed in the fallout from the collapse of FTX in November. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged eight celebrities for not disclosing they were paid to promote cryptocurrencies. Further, Snoop — along with several other celebrities and crypto firms — is facing a class action lawsuit filed in December that alleges he was part of a scheme to artificially inflate the price of Bored Apes with inauthentic celebrity hype.   The rapper's representatives did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  He told CNBC in an interview published in June last year that his interest in crypto focused on the intellectual property rights (IP) that came with it. ""Being able to own and control the whole IP and not be used as a face or marketing tool or, you know, someone as an ambassador, but to actually be the owner, the CEO,"" he replied when asked why he got into crypto.   The Bored Ape craze Bored Apes were already a craze — with many sports and entertainment stars using them for social media profile pics and more — when Ripps copied them last year. He sold his versions as RR/BAYC with an accompanying website that detailed claims the Bored Apes contained references to racist memes on 4chan, a troll website.  Yuga Labs sued Ripps not for defamation, but for trademark infringement.  Yuga didn't have registered trademarks, so it had to argue in court that consumers associate the company with its logos and apes. It did that, in part, by pointing to the many celebrities who publicly talked about Bored Apes.   Ripps' lawyers counter that the celebrities were paid to promote the apes without disclosing it, and therefore Yuga has ""unclean hands"" — a legal principle meaning that if the apes got their fame improperly, it can't be used to assert trademark rights.  Court documents recently filed by Ripps' lawyers state, ""Snoop Dogg created a music video featuring a BAYC image and performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in a performance using a BAYC image."" The filing further alleges: ""Yuga did not disclose its cash payment to Snoop Dogg for the endorsements, nor did it disclose that Snoop Dogg was a Yuga investor"" in connection with the performance. Yuga Labs previously told CNN that the celebrities were not paid to promote the Bored Apes.  Guy Oseary, a Hollywood agent who sits on Yuga's board and invested in the company, also told CNN the celebrities were not paid. But the Ripps filings say Oseary stated in a deposition ""he believes Snoop Dogg was paid around $1 million for 'financial support to do the video and performance...'""  Oseary did not respond to a request for comment on this subject. Oseary's deposition in the Ripps case has been sealed, at the request of Yuga Labs. A few hours after the filings were posted, Ripps' lawyers said they'd made an error in failing to redact the documents. A lawyer for Ripps told CNN he could not comment on the issue.   Yuga Labs initially declined to comment to CNN. After publication, a spokesperson sent the following statement: ""Defendants Ripps and [Jeremy] Cahen included verifiably false information in their court documents based on a twisted interpretation of the facts. Yuga Labs is proud of the investors and partners who share our vision for web3. The fact is that Yuga has never paid anyone to join or promote the club, and despite all the false allegations, Yuga has never given Apes to celebrities. When our seed round took place, we publicly and proudly announced our investors — including Snoop Dogg. Our involvement in his and Eminem's performance at the MTV VMA was well known and publicized before, during and after the show."" In a court filing posted Monday, Yuga said the description of Oseary's statements was ""incomplete and misleading,"" though it did not offer contradictory statements from his deposition. Yuga also said the Snoop information poses a danger of ""unfair prejudice and confusing the issues.""  John Jasnoch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the separate class action lawsuit, has been watching the Ripps case closely. ""The recent filings in the Ripps case provide a unique insight into the web of interconnected financial interests between the entertainment industry and predatory crypto venture capital,"" Jasnoch said.  Jasnoch pointed out that the sum Snoop allegedly received — around $1 million — is much more than the money paid to other celebrities who got busted for undisclosed crypto promo. Kim Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax; the SEC fined her $1.26 million for not disclosing it last October. Lindsay Lohan was allegedly paid $10,000 to tweet about Tronix crypto tokens; the SEC charged her with illegally touting it without disclosure in March and ordered her to pay more than $40,000. Former NBA player Paul Pierce was paid $244,000 to promote EthereumMax; in February he agreed to pay $1.4 million for not disclosing it.  Failure to disclose In the press release about the Pierce fine, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, ""This case is yet another reminder to celebrities: The law requires you to disclose to the public from whom and how much you are getting paid to promote investment in securities, and you can't lie to investors when you tout a security.""  There is no indication that Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, is the target of any investigation or facing any federal accusation of wrongdoing. When CNN asked if Snoop Dogg was being investigated, the SEC issued its usual response that it would not comment on any specific case. The FTC also would not comment on a specific case. In general, an FTC spokesperson said, ""if there's a connection between an endorser and a marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed.""  The government views shilling for makeup or shoes as different from shilling for crypto. The SEC says cryptocurrency is a security -— an investment product that requires more extensive disclosures from an endorser. The SEC has not yet said whether NFTs — unique digital files bought and sold in crypto — are securities. Ripps' team says they are, and at least one federal court has recently agreed that NFTs can be securities, depending on how they're traded. Yuga says they're not.   Whether NFT issuers must make SEC-required disclosures can also have serious implications for regular people trying to make a quick buck on the internet. Molly White, a Harvard fellow and a critic of the crypto industry, told CNN some firms operated under a ""greater fools"" strategy — that to profit from their crypto products, they needed to bring in a wider and wider audience to offload them onto. Iconic celebrities brought in the widest audience possible.  Snoop's potential liability In their live/video hybrid performance at the VMAs, Snoop and Eminem morph into their Bored Apes as they rap about smoking weed and being rich. Snoop did not say he was paid, though Yuga asserted in court documents that Yuga's name appeared in the end credits of the awards show broadcast.  When looking at whether Snoop could be in regulatory trouble, there are a few questions to keep in mind, according to Charles Whitehead, a professor of business law at Cornell Law School. ""If Snoop is getting paid to promote the NFTs, then the first thing you'd have to decide is as a securities law matter, is it a security? If the answer is yes — and the SEC position has been in most of these cases, yes — then the question is, is he somehow conditioning interest in investing in securities?""   If Snoop were paid to say he'd invested in Bored Apes and they're really cool, ""That looks like it crosses the line at both the federal and the state level. ... He's got to disclose that this is a paid sponsorship and the amount that he's getting paid,"" Whitehead said.   Only dancing around as a Bored Ape, and not talking about it, ""looks a lot less like an endorsement, and looks a lot less like you are promoting an investment in the security,"" Whitehead said. That would be unlikely to raise SEC or FTC issues, he said. You are allowed to get paid to perform in a logo. You could ride around MTV's stage in a little wooden wagon for Wells Fargo.   But, there's another complicating layer. What if you've promoted an investment on social media — as Snoop did throughout 2022 — but you only get paid to dance around in the investment's logo in a video? ""Paid for the video but not paid for the tweets? Well, I mean, nudge nudge wink wink,"" Whitehead said. ""If the substance is that I'm in fact getting paid to tout the security, even if the contract says I'm only getting paid for the video — too bad, so sad. You cannot get around the law that easily.""  The overlapping lawsuits provide a window into the overlapping interests of the people involved. When Snoop got his Bored Ape in December 2021, he tweeted the image and thanked MoonPay, a crypto payments firm that says its ""concierge service"" allows wealthy people to buy NFTs without setting up a crypto wallet. In March 2022, Snoop invested in Yuga Labs, and the month after, he invested in MoonPay. Court documents filed by Ripps' lawyers say Snoop also invested in Yuga as ""an indirect investor through the investment fund Sound Ventures,"" which is run by Guy Oseary, the Hollywood agent on Yuga's board. Sound Ventures invested in Yuga and MoonPay. MoonPay also invested in Yuga. One of MoonPay's crypto wallets spent $15 million on Bored Apes.  In the VMAs video, Eminem turns into a white ape wearing ""hip hop clothes,"" while Snoop becomes a cheetah-fur ape wearing a ""pimp coat,"" according to Yuga Labs' description. Eminem rapped, ""I was penniless, now I'm plenty rich. And the sh*t don't make any sens

                      Predictions about the decline of Christianity in America may be premature
                  ","
                      The cross, and the empty tomb. Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story. One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrection, and the claim that death does not have the final word on him or his followers.  As millions of Americans celebrate the holiest day in the Christian calendar on Sunday, most will hear some variation of this Easter message — finding new life in unforeseen places. But that message could also describe a surprising prediction about the future of Christianity in the US. For years, church leaders and commentators have warned that Christianity is dying in America. They say the American church is poised to follow the path of churches in Western Europe: soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews, shuttered church buildings converted into skate parts and nightclubs, and a secularized society where one theologian said Christianity as a norm is ""probably gone for good — or at least for the next 100 years."" Yet when CNN asked some of the nation's top religion scholars and historians recently about the future of Christianity in the US, they had a different message.  They said the American church is poised to find new life for one major reason: Waves of Christians are migrating to the US.  And they said the biggest challenge to Christianity's future in America is not declining numbers, but the church's ability to adapt to this migration. Joseph P. Slaughter, a historian and assistant professor of religion at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, says people have been predicting the extinction of Christianity in the US for over two centuries, and it hasn't happened yet. He pointed to Thomas Jefferson, one of the nation's founding fathers, who predicted in the 1820s that Christianity would be replaced in the US by a more enlightened form of religion that rejected Jesus' divinity and belief in miracles. Instead, Jefferson's prophecy was followed by a series of revivals, including the Second Great Awakening, which swept across America and reasserted Christianity as a dominant force in American life. ""I'd never bet against American Christianity — particularly evangelicalism,"" Slaughter says, ""and its ability to adapt and remain a significant shaper of the American society.""  What's happening in Europe is the church's nightmare scenario If one only looks at the numbers, Slaughter's optimism seems misguided. Virtually every recent poll about Christianity in America has been brutal for its followers.  About 64% of Americans call themselves Christian today. That might sound like a lot, but 50 years ago that number was 90%, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. That same survey said the Christian majority in the US may disappear by 2070. The Covid-19 pandemic also hurt the church in America. Church attendance has rebounded recently but remains slightly below pre-pandemic levels.  A  2021 Gallup poll revealed another grim number for Christians: church membership in the US has fallen below 50% for the first time.  In addition, a cascade of headlines in recent years have stained the church's reputation, including sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention; the spread of White Christian nationalism; and the perception that the church oppresses marginalized groups such as LGBTQ people. Church leaders in the US also have fretted about the rise of ""nones."" These are people who describe themselves as atheists, agnostics or ""nothing in particular"" when asked their religious identity. The ascent of nones will transform the country's religious and political landscape, says Tina Wray, a professor of religious and theological studies at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. About 30% of Americans now call themselves nones. ""The interest of the nones will soon outweigh those of the religious right in just a matter of years,"" Wray says. ""Nones are going to vote as a bloc and they're going to be pretty powerful. White evangelicals will eventually be eclipsed by the unaffiliated.""  Wray says those who are optimistic about the future of the American church underestimate how quickly Christianity can lose its influence even in a place where it once thrived. She cites what's happened in the Republic of Ireland, an overwhelmingly Catholic country. The Catholic Church prohibits divorce and was once so powerful in Ireland that the country wouldn't legally grant its citizens the legal right to a divorce until 1995, says Wray, author of ""What the Bible Really Tells Us: The Essential Guide to Biblical Literacy."" But Wray adds that she recently traveled to Ireland and discovered many of its citizens have left the religion. Churches are being closed and turned into apartment buildings, she says. ""People who went to mass everyday stopped going,"" she says. ""There's this cultural Catholic identity, but as far as practicing their faith, it's just disappearing. So within a generation, that's all it took. It's just shocking."" Why the American church's future may be different than Europe's Most of the religious scholars CNN spoke to said the American church may find salvation in another demographic trend: the booming of Christianity in what is called the ""Global South,"" the regions encompassing Latin America, Africa and Asia. The world's largest megachurch, for example, is not in the US. It's in South Korea. The Yoido Full Gospel Church has a weekly attendance of about 600,000 members.  Perry Hamalis spent time as a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, where he personally witnessed the vitality of the Christian church in the Global South. He says the church is not perceived in South Korea as an instrument of oppression, but one of liberation. When South Korea was colonized by the Japanese in the early 20th century, the church aligned with Koreans to protest. ""Christianity was looked at not as a religion of empire and of the colonizers, but as the religion of the anti-colonial movement and of pro-democracy,"" says Hamalis, a religion professor at North Central College in Illinois. The US has more immigrants than any other country. People from Latin America and Asia now make up the overwhelming majority of immigrants to the US, and many are bringing their religious fervor with them. This migration is known as the ""Browning of America,"" a phrase describing a demographic shift that is expected to make White people the minority in the US by 2045.  Those who predict that the church in America will collapse often overlook how the migration of Global South Christians to America will revitalize the country's religious landscape, scholars say. Christianity could rebound in America if White Christians embrace this one change, they say. Tish Harrison Warren, a New York Times columnist, pointed out recently that Latino evangelicals are now the fastest-growing group of evangelicals in the US. ""We cannot assume that America will become more secular so long as the future of America is less white,"" Warren wrote. The influx of Black and brown Christians from places like Latin America and Asia collides with another trend: a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement that insists, incorrectly, that the US was founded as a White, Christian nation. It is hostile to non-White immigrants. Some churches may discover that Jesus' command to welcome the stranger collides with their definition of patriotism, Hamalis says. ""Many congregations don't realize how much of their Christian identity is wrapped up with a kind of (Christian) nationalist narrative,"" Hamalis says. ""There's nothing wrong with loving one's country, but from a Christian perspective that ought to always be secondary to the mission of building the body of Christ and witnessing to the Gospel in the world."" How Christianity could re-establish its dominance There are other factors hiding in plain sight that point to the continued vitality of Christianity, others say. For one, declining church membership doesn't automatically translate into declining influence. Consider some recent landmark events. White evangelicals played a critical role in getting former President Trump elected. Conservative Christian groups played a crucial role in the recent passage of state laws limiting LGBTQ rights. And the Supreme Court's decision last year to overturn Roe vs. Wade was a massive victory for many conservative Christians. And atheism remains a taboo in American politics. American voters still prefer candidates -- including presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden -- who profess or evoke Christian beliefs. ""Christianity still holds a lot of capital in this country,"" says Lee M. Jefferson, an associate professor of religion at Centre College in Kentucky. ""There has always been a popular notion that a religious community's strength or influence is connected to numbers and attendance,"" Jefferson says. ""Even if there is ample space in cathedrals, Christianity will still hold some strong relevance in different landscapes in the US."" Even the rise of the ""nones,"" the growing number of Americans who say they don't care about religion, is not as much of a threat to the church as initial reports suggest, scholars say. A growing number of Americans may no longer identify as Christian, but many still care about spirituality, says Hans Gustafson, author of ""Everyday Wisdom: Interreligious Studies for a Pluralistic World.""  ""Just because more Americans are disaffiliating with institutionalized religion — most notably Christian traditions — this does not always mean that people are becoming less religious,"" says Gustafson, director of the Jay Phillips Center for Interreligious Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. ""Many still practice spirituality: prayer, meditation... and sometimes even regularly attend religious houses of worship,"" he says. Among Americans with no religious affiliation, some still pray daily and say religion is very important in their lives, Gustafson says. He cites a surprising finding from a 2018 Pew Research Center study of religion in Western Europe. The study found that nones in the US are ""much more likely"" to pray and believe in God than their European counterparts, said Neha Sahgal, a vice president of research at Pew. ""In fact, by some of these standard measures of religious commitment, American 'nones' are as religious as — or even more religious than — Christians in several European countries, including France, Germany and the UK,"" Sahgal wrote. Why the Easter message offers a note of hope  Despite the optimism of many religious scholars, the future of Christianity in America still seems uncertain. Poll numbers about the decline of religiousness in the US cannot be ignored, along with something more intangible: the frailties of human nature. What if the US enters another xenophobic period and limits migration from non-White Christians?  What if progressive Ch

                      Los Angeles school workers' union votes to approve new contract with school district

                      The union representing thousands of Los Angeles school workers has voted ""overwhelmingly"" to approve a new contract with the Los Angeles Unified School District after last month's three-day strike, union officials said in a news release Saturday.  More than 99% of Service Employees International Union Local 99 members voted to approve the new agreement in voting held between April 3 and 7, per the union, which represents about 30,000 Los Angeles school custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers and other student services staff.  The board of the Los Angeles Unified School District also has to vote on the agreement, which the union said includes: • A 30% wage increase, bringing the average salary from $25,000 to $33,000  • A $1,000 bonus for those who worked during the Covid-19 pandemic  • Fully paid family health care benefits that will be expanded to teachers' assistants and after-school program workers, among others • Increased hours for workers like special education assistants ""This contract recognizes the essential work of those who work hard to ensure students can learn in a clean, safe, and supportive environment,"" Max Arias, SEIU Local 99 executive director, said in the release.  ""It is a major step forward with significant improvements to wages, work hours, and benefits for dedicated education workers who have been left behind for far too long."" Feeling undervalued by what the union said were low wages, minimal staffing and inadequate hours, members went on strike for three days last month, between March 21 and 23, halting classes for the more than half a million students served by the nation's second-largest school district.  The United Teachers Los Angeles union supported the school workers' strike, urging its members to join picket lines and rallies in solidarity. The strike followed nearly a year of unsuccessful negotiations with the LAUSD.

                      Six people were injured in a shooting after fights broke out on a South Carolina beach Friday while high school seniors were skipping school before spring break was set to start, police said. Hundreds of people were at the beach in the coastal city of Isle of Palms, about 15 miles east of Charleston, when gunfire erupted around 5:20 p.m. ET Friday, Police Chief Kevin Cornett said during a news conference. The chief said the shooting began amid several fights among people who were participating in senior skip day. Cornett said five of those injured were around the age of 18. One adult woman in her mid-30s or early 40s was also wounded, Cornett added. Some of the injured were taken to a hospital while others went on their own. All injuries were non-life-threatening, according to city officials. Five of those injured were released from hospital by Saturday, Isle of Palms City said in a news release. The other remains in stable condition. Two individuals were charged in the incident: a 16-year-old for unlawful carry of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm, and an 18-year-old for unlawful carry of a firearm, the release said.

The program provides funding for up to three years of tuition and fees at six partner institutions, according to the news release. The funding also covers up to $250 per semester in related costs, like textbooks and transportation, and debt up to $2,500 for ""students with an outstanding balance at a partner college that is preventing a student from re-enrolling at that college."" Bostonians will be eligible for free tuition at Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology, Bunker Hill Community College, Massasoit Community College, MassBay Community College, Roxbury Community College and Urban College of Boston, according to the release. Potential students won't need to fill out a separate application for the program, just the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, according to the release. Undocumented immigrants and students who have DACA status or Temporary Protected Status will not need to complete the FAFSA to be eligible for the program. Any associate's degree or ""short-term certificate program"" at a partner institution will be eligible for the funding, according to a fact sheet published by the Boston government. Students who are already enrolled at a participating school are not eligible for the plan. ""Costs should not be a barrier to higher education,"" said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a tweet Wednesday. The program ""will continue to help more residents afford, attend & complete college."" Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley also voiced excitement for the expansion on Twitter. ""Expanding Boston's free community college program will help remove economic barriers to higher education,"" she said.

                      Israeli forces shot and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in the Aqbat Jaber refugee camp near the occupied West Bank city of Jericho, Palestinian officials said, as violence in the region continued to simmer on Monday.  Mohammad Fayez Balhan was ""killed by live occupation bullets in the head, chest and abdomen,"" the ministry said, adding that two other people were injured by live ammunition and sent to a hospital in Jericho for treatment. The Israeli military said they raided the camp to arrest a ""terror suspect.""  ""During the activity, violent riots were instigated in a number of locations,"" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""As the soldiers left the area, suspects opened fire toward them, hurled explosive devices and Molotov cocktails. The soldiers responded with live fire and .22 caliber ammunition. Hits were identified.""  Tensions in Israel and the occupied West Bank have spiraled in the aftermath of recent Israeli police raids on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.  Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh warned that images of Israeli forces storming the mosque had ""created an incredible mood of anger among every Palestinian, wherever they are -- in Gaza, in Ramallah, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Syria,"" and called on Israel to deescalate the situation. ""There is a mood of anger that is there in the heart and mind of every Palestinian,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.    Over the last week, dozens of rockets were launched from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria into Israeli territory, followed by Israeli retaliatory strikes.  On Friday, a vehicle hit a group of tourists in Tel Aviv, killing one Italian national, in what Israeli authorities described as a terror attack. Two sisters, aged 15 and 20, with dual British-Israeli citizenship were also killed Friday in a shooting attack in the West Bank. On Monday, the mother of the women, Lucy Dee, succumbed to wounds sustained during the shooting.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the shooting as a ""severe terrorist attack.""  ""On behalf of all citizens of Israel, I convey heartfelt condolences to the Dee family on the passing of the mother of the family, Leah (Lucy), who was murdered in the severe terrorist attack in the Jordan Valley last Friday, together with her two daughters Maia and Rina,"" Netanyahu said in a statement Monday.     Netanyahu on Friday instructed Israeli police ""to mobilize all border police units in reserve and the IDF to mobilize additional forces in face of terrorist attacks,"" according to his office. The Israeli military said it was on high alert, calling up an unspecified number of reservists amid what it described as ""very volatile times."" Also on Monday, thousands of Israeli settlers staged a march to Evyatar, an illegal settler outpost in the occupied West Bank that has been a flashpoint for Israel's settler movement. Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Givr, among those who have spearheaded a campaign to legalize the outpost, was among the protesters. Evyatar sits on a hilltop, along a corridor linking Tel Aviv to the Jordan Valley, known locally as Jabal Subeih. Palestinians who say they own land in the site have been holding counter-protests.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians close to the nearby town of Beita led to nearly hundreds of injuries, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.  The Palestinian Red Crescent said 216 people were injured in the clashes, including 22 people hit by rubber bullets which, they say, were fired by Israeli forces. Three people were transferred to hospital, it also said. In a statement, the IDF said ""a violent riot"" had been instigated near Beita, adding that ""rocks were hurled at the soldiers, lightly injuring two IDF soldiers"" and ""security forces at the scene responded with riot dispersal means."" Asked about video shared on social media that appeared to show Israeli forces throwing tear gas canisters at journalists in the area, the Israel Police released a statement saying it ""appears that the security forces failed to adhere to the established rules and guidelines"" in ensuring freedom of the press. Palestinians in Beita, which is just south of Nablus, say they own the land at Evyatar.  Israeli settlers left Evyatar in 2021 after a deal with the government of then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The buildings remained as part of the government's deal with the settlers. ""The land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel, belongs to us,"" Knesset member Ariel Kallner, of Netanyahu's Likud party, told CNN. ""I think that those who live here, the Arabs and so on, they can live here. But it's our land.""  Under international law, both the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered occupied territory and settlements there illegal, which Israel disputes.  Nabil Abu Radina, a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the march as an ""invasion of settler militias, led by ministers from the Israeli occupation government."" Abu Radina also demanded than ""immediate and quick intervention"" by the US government to ""stop this madness for which the entire region will pay the price.""

                      The suicide rate in the United States returned to a near-record high in 2021, reversing two years of decline, according to a report released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Final data for the year shows that suicide was the 11th leading cause of death nationwide, with more than 14 deaths for every 100,000 people. The death rate has increased 32% over the past two decades, and the 4% jump between 2020 and 2021 was the sharpest annual increase in that timeframe. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 34 and fifth for people ages 35 to 54. The suicide death rate was four times higher among men than women in 2021, CDC data shows, as it has been in many years prior. Rates increased significantly for men of most ages between 2020 and 2021 but were relatively unchanged for women of most ages, except for a significant rise among those 75 and older. Rates were highest among American Indian people -- about twice as high as average for men and three times as high for women -- and rates spiked about 17% between 2020 and 2021. Rates also increased significantly for Black and White men and women. Another report published Thursday by the CDC shows that adolescents were the age group most likely to visit the emergency department for suicidal thoughts in recent years. Children are facing increasing mental health challenges, with significant shares of both teen girls (57%) and boys (29%) saying they felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021. Nearly 1 in 3 teen girls said they seriously considered attempting suicide, a recent CDC survey found. But growing demand for services is matched with a nationwide shortage of beds for children who need mental health help, leaving many children waiting in emergency department beds and crowding hospitals.

                      Concerned about the courts, some states and universities are stockpiling abortion drugs
                  ","
                      With an eye on the courts, a growing number of Democratic-led states are stockpiling the pills that can be used for a medication abortion, the most common form of the procedure in the US. The officials want to be prepared, in case US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone goes through, so medication abortions would still be available in their states for some period of time. But they're taking different approaches to the idea. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday that her state's Department of Health would buy 150,000 doses of misoprostol, the other of the two drugs typically used in a medication abortion. Misoprostol can be used off-label for an abortion, without mifepristone, but patients often have to use more of it. It would not be covered by the court case, and if Kacsmaryk's decision stands, the New York City's Health Department tweeted, it will change to using this medication only. ""Medication abortion continues to be available at our Sexual Health Clinics and NYC Health + Hospitals locations. Should mifepristone become unavailable, we will continue to make medication abortion accessible to all in NYC by shifting to a misoprostol-only treatment regimen,"" the tweet said.  The state says the 150,000 doses should represent a five-year supply of pills. ""Anti-choice extremists have shown that they are not stopping at overturning Roe, and they are working to entirely dismantle our country's reproductive health care system, including medication abortion and contraception,"" Hochul said. ""New York will always be a safe harbor for abortion care, and I am taking action to protect abortion access in our State and continue to lead the nation in defending the right to reproductive autonomy."" California is also stocking up on misoprostol. ""While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday's ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a release Monday. California plans to purchase up to 2 million pills through CalRx, a state initiative set up to make drugs more affordable.  The governor's office said the state now has more than 250,000 pills on hand, which it purchased for about $100,000.  California said it shared the terms of its purchase agreement with other members of the Reproductive Freedom Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition of 21 governors who are committed to protecting reproductive rights, and who might also be interested in taking such action. Another member of that alliance, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, announced last week that his state bought a three year-supply of mifepristone, the drug at the center of Kacsmaryk's ruling.  Inslee directed the state Department of Corrections -- which has a pharmacy license and is legally able to buy medications -- to buy the drug last month, he said, and the shipment was delivered March 31. The University of Washington also purchased 10,000 doses.  Lawmakers are introducing a bill to authorize officials to distribute or sell the medication to licensed providers throughout the state. ""This Texas lawsuit is a clear and present danger to patients and providers all across the country. Washington will not sit by idly and risk the devastating consequences of inaction,"" Inslee said. ""Washington is a pro-choice state, and no Texas judge will order us otherwise."" In the meantime, its attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is helping lead a multistate lawsuit to protect access to mifepristone.  On Friday, the same day Kacsmaryk's ruling came down, a federal judge in Washington ordered the US not to make any changes that would restrict access to mifepristone in the territories that brought the lawsuit: 17 states and the District of Columbia.  On Monday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura T. Healey announced that at her request, the University of Massachusetts and health care providers have also taken action to stockpile doses of mifepristone. The governor's office said last week that the university bought about 15,000 doses of mifepristone, enough to cover the commonwealth for about a year, and the pills are expected to arrive this week. Local health care providers have agreed to buy more, and the government agreed to set aside $1 million to pay for those doses. The Massachusetts governor also signed an executive order confirming protections for medication abortion under existing law.  ""Here in Massachusetts, we are not going to let one extremist judge in Texas turn back the clock on this proven medication and restrict access to care in our state,""  Healey said. ""The action we are taking today protects access to mifepristone in Massachusetts and protects patients and providers from liability. In Massachusetts, we stand for civil rights and freedom. We will always protect access to reproductive health care, including medication abortion.""  Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of the brand-name version of mifepristone, says that orders for the drug have increased substantially in recent months and are significantly higher than they were at this time last year.  Demand for mifepristone is up across all types of customers, including clinics, pharmacies and individual providers, said Abby Long, Danco's director of public affairs. But Massachusetts is the only state that has requested an especially large number of pills from the company. Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who called the Texas decision ""reckless"" and a ""fundamental assault on women's rights,"" said Monday that her administration is evaluating its options, ""including procuring mifepristone if needed, to protect access to medication abortion for Maine women.""  The Connecticut governor's office said Wednesday that it is also monitoring the situation.  Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's office said in an email Wednesday that she has directed the Oregon Health Authority to ""explore all available avenues for ensuring Oregon is prepared should Mifepristone become less available. That includes evaluating the supply of Mifepristone and Misoprostol and consulting with providers to better understand the potential impact on the provision of abortion and reproductive health care and what additional support might be necessary.""

                      Biden administration declares fentanyl laced with xylazine 'an emerging threat' in the US
                  ","
                      The White House has declared that the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl combined with xylazine -- an animal tranquilizer that's increasingly being used in illicit drugs -- is an ""emerging threat"" facing the United States due to its role in the ongoing opioid crisis.  Administration officials call the threat FAAX, for fentanyl-adulterated or -associated xylazine.  The move, announced Wednesday, marks the first time in history that any administration has declared a substance to be an emerging threat to the country, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 established that the office has authority to declare such ""emerging threats,"" and no administration has used it until now. Last year, Congress declared methamphetamine an emerging drug threat but none have been declared by an administration previously. Under other agencies or in separate circumstances, concerns such as bioterrorism, infectious diseases or climate change may be identified as ""emerging threats."" ""This drug, which is an animal sedative, is being mixed with fentanyl and is being found in almost all 50 states now,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""It's become an important part for us to make sure that we're declaring it an emerging threat."" Now that the administration has declared fentanyl combined with xylazine an emerging threat, it has 90 days to coordinate a national response. ""We are working quickly to develop and implement a whole of government nationwide plan, with real deliverable action, that will save lives and will be published within 90 days of this designation,"" Gupta said. Xylazine, also known as tranq or tranq dope, has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths in the United States due to its rising illicit use. Between 2020 and 2021, overdose deaths involving xylazine increased more than 1,000% in the South, 750% in the West and about 500% in the Midwest, according to an intelligence report released last year by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. And in some cases, people might not even know that xylazine was in the drug they used. Just last month, authorities at the DEA issued a public safety alert about the ""widespread threat"" of fentanyl mixed with xylazine, reporting that in 2022 approximately 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine. Fentanyl, which has been driving the opioid crisis, is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high the drug provides.  Xylazine is not an opioid. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine, typically in horses, but it is not approved for use in humans. And xylazine can do major damage to the human body, including leaving drug users with severe skin ulcers, soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. ""Xylazine is one of the contaminants in fentanyl, but there could be others,"" Gupta said. ""So, I think with the declaration of an emerging threat, we're sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit xylazine and illicit fentanyl that we're going to respond quicker, we're going to match the challenge of evolution of these drugs supply, and that we're going to protect lives first and foremost.""  'There is a shift that is occurring' Now that xylazine has been declared an emerging threat, some of President Biden's $46 billion drug budget request to Congress can be used to respond.  This year, the Biden administration announced that the President has called on Congress to invest $46.1 billion for agencies overseen by the Office of National Drug Control Policy to tackle the nation's illicit drug crisis. If the budget request is not approved, there could be the option to reallocate money within the Office of National Drug Control Policy, but ""we don't want to be in a position where moneys that are being utilized for some other important aspect of saving lives has to be moved away for this purpose,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""That is the reason we are asking Congress to act."" Such funds could be used to test drugs on the street for xylazine, collect data on FAAX, invest in care for people exposed to FAAX and develop potential treatments for a xylazine-related overdose.  The medication naloxone, also known as Narcan, is an antidote for an opioid overdose, but people who have overdosed on a combination of opioids and xylazine may not immediately wake up after taking naloxone, as it may not reverse the effects of xylazine in the same way it does opioids. ""We need to recognize, first of all, that there is a shift that is occurring from organic compounds and substances like heroin and cocaine to more synthetics,"" Gupta said of the state of the nation's illicit drug crisis.  ""Both the types of drugs have changed -- from predominantly organic to predominantly synthetics -- but the way drugs are bought and sold have also changed,"" he said. ""Now, all you need is a phone in the palm of your hand and a social media app to order and buy some of the most dangerous substances on planet Earth."" Rise of synthetic drugs Xylazine is just one of the many adulterants -- or substances that are typically added to others -- found in the nation's illicit drug supply. ""All of a sudden, you can synthesize hundreds of compounds and kind of mix them together and see what does the best in the market,"" Joseph Friedman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in March. ""People are synthesizing new benzodiazepines, new stimulants, new cannabinoids constantly and adding them into the drug supply. So people have no idea what they're buying and what they're consuming."" Some of these adulterants may be as simple as sugar or artificial sweeteners added for taste or additives or fillers that bulk up the drug. Sometimes, they may be contaminants left over from the manufacturing process.  But all of these things can carry real-life health harms, says Naburan Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and senior scientist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Like an opioid, xylazine can depress the respiratory system, so the risk of overdose multiplies when it's combined with heroin or fentanyl. Also, ""in the veterinary literature, we know that it causes a really bad severe form of anemia. And so when people are injecting heroin that's contaminated with xylazine, they can end up with a near-fatal form of blood iron deficiency,"" Dasgupta said in March. ""We had one person here who ended up going to the hospital needing multiple blood transfusions. And it was all because of the xylazine."" Move to make xylazine a controlled substance US lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine as a controlled substance. In March, bipartisan legislation -- the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act -- was introduced in the House and Senate. It describes illicit xylazine as an ""urgent threat to public health and safety"" and calls for it to be a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl. ""Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said in a statement in March. The bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that the product is not being diverted to the black market. ""This bill recognizes the dangers posed by the increasing abuse of animal tranquilizers by drug traffickers, and provides new tools to combat this deadly trend,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the statement.  ""It also ensures that folks like veterinarians, ranchers and cattlemen can continue to access these drugs for bona fide animal treatment.""

                      'It just didn't enter my mind to initiate sex;' Low sex drive in men linked to chemical imbalance
                  ","
                      While hanging out with his college roommates, Peter (not his real name) realized he felt differently about sex than other heterosexual men. ""I've never been somebody who was interested in pornography, but I'd laugh along with their jokes,"" said Peter, now 44, who is British. ""Of course I never mentioned that ... as a man, you'd be kicked out of the herd."" As he developed ""proper, serious relationships"" with women, Peter discovered he didn't have the sexual drive many of his partners did. ""I would make excuses around getting tired or feeling stressed, that kind of thing,"" he said. ""It wasn't an issue with attraction to my partner. It just didn't enter my mind to initiate sex."" In 2021, Peter saw an ad recruiting male volunteers for a new study on hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Researchers planned to inject the study's participants with kisspeptin —a naturally occurring sexual hormone — to see if it increased their sex drive. Kisspeptin plays a key role in reproduction; without adequate levels of the hormone children do not go through puberty, for example. In a long-term, committed relationship with a woman he says has a higher sexual appetite, Peter signed up, intrigued by the thought that a biological imbalance might help explain his behavior. In the week after the final session, Peter said, something amazing occurred. ""All of a sudden, I wanted to initiate intimacy. I can only presume it was driven not by my mind remembering something, but my body wanting something,"" he said. ""I did initiate sex more and it improved things with my partner incredibly.""  Wiring in the brain Experts believe HSDD affects at least 10% of women and up to 8% of men, although those numbers may be low, said Stanley Althof, a professor emeritus of psychology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio and executive director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Health of South Florida. ""Men are embarrassed to go to the doctor to begin with, and you're supposed to be a macho guy,"" said Althof, who was not involved in the kisspeptin study.  ""So it's difficult for men to say, 'Hey, I've got a problem with my sex drive.' That's why the majority of male patients I see with HSDD are sent in by their partners.""   To be diagnosed with the disorder, a person must have no other issues that might cause a change in libido, such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.   ""Losing interest due to performance issues is common, but HSDD is its own thing,"" Althof said. ""It's an absence of erotic thoughts and a lack of desire for sex that has to be present for six months. It also cannot be better explained by another disorder or other stressors: It can't be due to depression. It can't be due to a bad relationship. It can't be due to taking an antidepressant."" One more key point: A man or woman must have clinically significant distress to have HSDD, said clinical psychologist Dr. Sheryl Kingsberg, a professor in reproductive biology and psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, who was also not involved in the kisspeptin study. ""Some people aren't bothered by their lack of interest in sex, so we wouldn't treat them for HSDD,"" said Kingsberg, who is also chief of behavioral medicine at MacDonald Women's Hospital and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. ""The women coming into my office are deeply distressed,"" she said. ""They tell me 'I used to have desire but it's gone. I could be on a desert island with no pressures, but I just don't have the appetite. I want it back.' Those women have HSDD."" 'Surreal' experience Dr. Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial College London, has been studying the relationship between low sexual desire and the hormone kisspeptin for years, first in animals, then in people. Prior studies by Dhillo of healthy men with no libido problems found giving them kisspeptin boosted levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, which is important for gonad function.  His newest study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open in February, enrolled 32 men with verified HSDD. Peter was one of them. ""So many people say to themselves, 'It's just me. I've got a problem.' But actually, HSDD may be how your brain is wired,"" said Dhillo, who is a dean at the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research Academy in Newcastle upon Tyne. ""The biology is telling us there's increased activation of inhibitory areas in the brain — the same areas that tell us it's not OK to walk around in public naked — and those areas are switching off sexual desire. How can we tackle that? We give a hormone that would naturally give you increased sexual desire, essentially hijacking the normal system."" The men participating in the new study visited Dhillo's lab twice. On each occasion, they were fitted with a device to objectively measure arousal, given an injection and asked to watch pornography while their brains were scanned via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neither the subjects or the researchers knew if that day's injection was kisspeptin or a placebo. ""It was extraordinarily surreal, lying there with something resembling a hangman's noose around your bits and watching a mixture of '70s to modern-day pornographic images and videos,"" Peter said. ""You'd get about five or six seconds of one type of image or video, rate your arousal for the researchers, and then move on to the next.""  Brain scans showed a significant dual effect after the kisspeptin injection, Dhillo said. Activity in the areas of the brain that inhibit behavior slowed, while areas of the brain connected to sexual interest lit up. ""As a group, the men had a 56% higher sexual response to sexual images after the kisspeptin than the placebo,"" Dhillo said. ""And we found no side effects at the very, very small dose that we are using.""  Peter noticed a difference immediately after finishing the treatments. His sex life was so robust, in fact, that it wasn't long before his partner was pregnant with their first child. As published, the study did not follow the men long-term to see if the effects of kisspeptin lasted. For Peter, however, its impact has been life-changing. ""I have found there's been a lasting effect for me,"" he said. ""I do find I have a much better sexual appetite even now some years after the treatment."" Even the arrival of a baby boy didn't deter his new interest in sex. ""The cliche is when you have kids, your sex life takes a bit of a hit,"" he told CNN. ""But that hasn't been the case for us. In fact, we're pregnant with our second child, due in July."" More research is needed While Peter had a positive long-term result, it's too soon to say kisspeptin injections were the reason, Althof said.  ""When you hear dramatic results like Peter's, I would be cautious in saying that is the typical outcome. While it's wonderful that it happened for him, these fMRI studies are difficult to interpret and not conclusive,"" he said. ""Sexual desire is very complicated — I say it's a combination of brain function, hormones and love, wine and roses,"" Althof added. ""This study is promising, but it needs replication in larger groups."" And even if future research does confirm kisspeptin's benefits, medical treatment is not a substitution for healthy communication about sex between partners and with health care providers, Dhillo said.  ""These are society's taboos, but actually, the more we talk about real (sexual) issues that affect real people, the more we find it's actually quite common,"" he said.""If you're not troubled by low libido, it's not an issue at all, but if you are troubled by it, this can lead to marital breakdown, unhappiness and reduced quality of life.""

                      EPA proposes new regulations on toxic gas used to sterilize spices and medical equipment
                  ","
                      The US Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed a set of new restrictions on facilities that use the cancer-causing chemical ethylene oxide, a colorless, odorless gas that is used to sterilize medical devices and spices. The agency said the new rules, which have not been finalized, would help to reduce ethylene oxide gas that these facilities release by 80%, bringing emissions below a Clean Air Act standard for elevated cancer risk. Communities exposed to ethylene oxide gas have been pushing the EPA to put tighter controls on plants that use ethylene oxide gas. In 2018, an EPA report found that dozens of communities across the nation faced elevated cancer risks because of trace of amounts of ethylene oxide released into air as part of the sterilization process. The EPA issued the report on the new risks without issuing a news release, as it had done for the same report in years past. Some affected communities learned of the risk through a health assessment conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and media reports. A report from the EPA's Office of the Inspector General found that some communities weren't alerted to their risk by EPA at all. The elevated risk became apparent after a two-decade long review of the toxicity of ethylene oxide by scientists in EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. While the EPA acknowledged that ethylene oxide was more dangerous that had been previously understood, it continued to use an older set of rules to regulate facilities that released ethylene oxide as well as companies that manufacture it. The proposed rules aim to better align regulations on the producers and users of ethylene oxide with the cancer risk posed by the chemical. They follow a set of proposed rules issued by EPA last week that would put new controls on facilities that manufacture ethylene oxide. Taken together, the two sets of rules would remove 77 tons of ethylene oxide emissions a year, an 84% reduction compared with 2020 levels, EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. Environmental watchdog groups applauded the proposed restrictions, but noted that they don't go far enough to protect vulnerable communities, where residents are often low-income and disproportionately people of color. ""These regulations are long overdue, by almost a decade. I'm relieved and pleased that the EPA has finally issued proposed standards that are based on their own scientists' recommendations on an updated, higher cancer risk value. If enacted, these updated regulations would reduce emissions in fenceline communities,"" said Darya Minovi, a senior researcher scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""When the EPA issues the final rule, they should throw the net wider. The standard should cover a larger range of facilities to include off-site warehouses that often store recently sterilized equipment that continue to release ethylene oxide, but aren't regulated for their air emissions."" Minovi also said the EPA should require fenceline monitors -- devices that constantly read the air outside of facilities to make sure that toxic gas isn't drifting into neighborhoods. Jaime Rukstales, a member of the Illinois grassroots advocacy group Stop EtO in Lake County -- one of the communities impacted by ethylene oxide pollution -- says the EPA needs to impose tougher restrictions on ""all types of facilities that impact the health of our communities ... including sterilizers, manufacturers and warehouses near our homes, schools and businesses.""   Some off-site warehouses used to store newly sterilized products have registered high levels of ethylene oxide due to off-gassing of the products.   Meanwhile, chemical manufacturers sued the EPA in February over its updated hazard assessment for ethylene oxide. The industry wants the agency to use a less protective standard developed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. AdvaMed, a group that lobbies for the interests of medical device manufacturers, warned that more regulations could pose problems for patients. ""If new EPA regulations force sterilization facilities to close, patients could face treatment delays as sterile technology supplies, such as pacemakers and surgical equipment, fall short,"" Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of AdvaMed, said in a comment posted on the group's website. The EPA said some commercial sterilizers have already made the planned changes. ""Many sterilization and health care facilities are already taking the steps outlined in the proposal and have seen emissions drop significantly,"" McCabe said. Most facilities have taken action to control ethylene oxide blown out of sterilization chambers through exhaust vents known as ""back vents"" but only 25% to 33% of sterilizers are controlling so-called fugitive emissions, ethylene oxide that escapes or leaks into room air, said Jonathan Witt, an environmental engineer and technical lead on EPA's review of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. ""So we think it's a good sizable chunk of the industry, but still a little ways to go,"" Witt said on a call with reporters. If the rules go into effect, sterilizers would have 18 months to make the changes, which the EPA said is an accelerated time frame under the Clean Air Act. AdvaMed's Whitaker says that's not enough time. ""It could take many months for abatement equipment to arrive. Supply chains and manufacturing are still recovering from the pandemic,"" he noted in the statement. In issuing the proposed rules, the EPA said it aimed to strike a balance between lowing cancer risks for impacted communities and workers who use ethylene oxide while preserving ""critical sterilization capabilities."" The proposed rules would apply to 86 commercial sterilization facilities in the United States that use ethylene oxide gas to fumigate spices and medical devices.   The EPA says 20 billion medical devices -- mostly single-use, disposable items used in health care such as catheters, gloves and surgical gowns -- are sterilized using ethylene oxide. The US Food and Drug Administration is actively exploring alternatives to the use of the gas, the EPA said on Tuesday, but some devices still can't be sterilized any other way. In proposing the new rules, EPA said its new analysis found that exposure to ethylene oxide, or EtO, on the job significantly increased cancer risks for workers in sterilization facilities and those who apply ethylene oxide in health care facilities.   ""Now, a new EPA analysis shows that there may also be significant risks to workers who handle [ethylene oxide] and people who live, work or go to school near places where EtO is used in sterilization. And failing to take action to address these risks is simply unacceptable,"" EPA Administrator Janet McCabe said on a call with reporters. The additional lifetime cancer risk for a worker exposed to ethylene oxide for eight hours a day, 240 days a year for 35 years was between 1 in 10 and 1 in 36 for workers in sterilization facilities; and between 1 in 12 and 1 in 25 for workers exposed to ethylene oxide in health care facilities. To help lower those risks, the proposed rules require greater use of personal protective equipment for workers and new controls to decrease the amount of ethylene oxide in indoor air. Whitaker from AdvaMed, the medical device industry group, said the cancer risk for employees exposed to ethylene oxide on the job is overstated and disregards ""the strong employee protections already in practice."" Companies will also be required to use new real-time monitoring methods to confirm that these pollution controls are working inside facilities. These controls can measure ethylene oxide in indoor air down to 10 parts per billion.  If ethylene oxide levels climb above this threshold, everyone in the workplace would be required to wear protective equipment. They will also lower the amount of ethylene oxide that can be used for each sterilization cycle. The EPA is proposing to limit the application rate for ethylene oxide to no more than 500 milligrams per liter of air.   The rules would eliminate some niche uses of ethylene oxide where alternatives exist, including its use in museums, archival settings, beekeeping, some cosmetics, and in musical instruments. The EPA will take public comment on the new rules for 60 days. The agency will also host a virtual public webinar on May 1 to discuss its proposed rules and new risk assessment.

                      Sexually transmitted infections jumped by 7% in 2021, according to the CDC
                  ","
                      More than 2.5 million cases of sexually transmitted infections were reported in 2021, jumping by 7% in one year, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""The US STI epidemic shows no signs of slowing,"" said Dr. Leandro Mena, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention.  Chlamydia accounted for more than half of the reported cases, with rates increasing about 4% in 2021. Cases of gonorrhea rose nearly 5%. Cases of syphilis surged 32% in one year, including an alarming rise in infections passed from pregnant mothers to babies developing in the womb. In 2021, congenital syphilis caused 220 stillbirths and infant deaths.  ""The most important thing to remember is that congenital syphilis is 100% preventable,"" Mena said. ""In many ways, it is the result of our failure to prevent syphilis among women of reproductive age and their partners."" Lacking prenatal care and adequate maternal treatment are among the most common missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis, he said.  But a recent report found that it's become harder for women to access reproductive health care services — such as routine screenings and birth control — in recent years. Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access — and more of them — in 2021 than they were in 2017.  A combination of factors has contributed to the overall rise in STI cases, and the pandemic exacerbated many of them, Mena said.  ""The lack of access to health care, including testing and treatment for STI, can make it difficult for people to receive the care they need,"" Mena said. ""Decreased funding for public health and an eroding infrastructure in public health really have limited access to testing driven services."" Persistent stigma associated with STIs and lingering effects of pandemic-related disruptions challenge the scope of screening services. The number of reported STIs is likely a vast underrepresentation of a ""staggering"" number of actual cases, he says.   STIs affect every population, but the 2021 data from the CDC shows that case rates are disproportionately high among gay and bisexual men, younger people, and Black and American Indian people.   ""To make progress towards ending this STI epidemic, we must really meet people where they are by developing tailored and localized interventions to have the greatest impact,"" Mena said. ""We want to make sure that we're addressing the social and economic conditions that make it more difficult for some of these populations to stay healthy.""

                      Suspension of mifepristone approval wouldn't be the end of medication abortion
                  ","
                      Even if US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone goes through, there still will be a nonsurgical option for people to manage abortions at home.  In the United States, the so-called abortion pill is actually two medications, mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym, or known as RU-486, and misoprostol, which is taken about 24 to 48 hours later.  The federal judge's ruling in Texas last week applies only to mifepristone. He delayed his ruling for a week to allow for appeals, but even if the ruling is put in place, it does not involve misoprostol.  Misoprostol alone is considered a safe and effective way to have an abortion, studies show. It has been used that way for decades. The two drugs work differently. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus, and without it, the uterus will expel its contents. Misoprostol is approved by the FDA to prevent and treat gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It also is used off-label for other kinds of ulcers, and it has several gynecological uses, including to induce contractions, to decrease blood loss after delivery and to treat miscarriages.  When used for an abortion, misoprostol works to help empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions. ""It's a little old-school, but we could do it,"" said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in New Jersey and a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  It's what people did before the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, Brandi said. ""Many places around the country that don't have access to mifepristone, often due to politics, have been using misoprostol-only regimens for a long time,"" she said. California said Monday that it is stockpiling misoprostol. ""While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday's ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a release.  Some health organizations such as Carafem, a national provider of reproductive health services, offer the one drug alone. It is endorsed as a medically acceptable approach by the World Health Organization. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says a misoprostol-only regimen is an ""acceptable alternative"" if mifepristone is unavailable. Misoprostol is safe and effective The two-drug approach to medicine abortion is preferable because it is slightly more effective, Brandi said. Also, abortion with misoprostol alone can come with more side effects. A person who uses this method is instructed to use it sublingually, putting four pills under their tongue and leaving them there for 30 minutes, then swallowing what's left with water. They can also be used vaginally.  Typically, bleeding will begin within one to four hours after the first dose. Heavy bleeding usually lasts about three to five hours, but bleeding can last two weeks or longer, studies show.  Without mifepristone, a person most likely has to take more misoprostol than they would with the two-drug regimen. One study suggested that a person should be prescribed three or four doses as well as an additional dose in case it is needed. ""The more we give, the more side effects people will have. And that's not the goal. We want to make sure people not only have an effective response to the medicine, we also want to make sure that people aren't as uncomfortable as they could be,"" Brandi said. ""Like I tell my patients, you do not need to suffer to have an abortion. That is not the purpose of this process.""  Other side effects can include fever, chills, nausea and diarrhea.  Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all US abortions, studies show. Even if mifepristone is no longer available and misoprostol becomes the only option, it will still be the most popular choice, according to Dr. Jamila Perritt, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in Washington, D.C.  ""Again, it is safe. It is effective. It requires a different dosing, and you experience the symptoms a little bit longer,"" Perritt said. ""There are some other some additional side effects, like a longer duration of bleeding or more intense nausea or vomiting or gastrointestinal side effects, but when you look at that against the barriers that are put in place, both at the state and now the federal level for accessing abortion, many individuals still choose the second medication alone, because it is more convenient and easier, and it means you're not walking through hundreds of protesters when you go to get care at your health care provider's office."" Dr. Iffath A. Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says that although the one-drug option is safe, people shouldn't have to make that choice because a lot of research shows that the two drugs in combination are highly safe and effective. ""We do use off label medications when clinically appropriate; however, that should not happen here because we have over two decades worth of clinically sound evidence based information that this is valid option,"" Hoskins said.

                      Gun violence has affected most families in the US, new survey finds
                  ","
                      Worry and fear about gun violence are widespread in the United States, where most families have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation.   Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found.  The new report comes less than a day after a shooting that claimed at least four lives in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured.  About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels.  These tragic trends are part of a gun epidemic that has become deadlier than ever in the US. There were nearly 49,000 gun-related deaths in 2021, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- an unprecedented surge of about 23% over two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily.  Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to another recent KFF analysis. There are vast disparities in who's dying from guns, too. A recent study found that the homicide rate among young Black men was nearly 10 times higher than the overall firearm death rate in the US in 2021.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot.  The weight of that disparity is felt heavily in the Black community. One in 6 Black adults say that they don't feel at all safe in their neighborhoods, far higher than the share of White or Hispanic adults, according to the new KFF survey. About a third of both Black and Hispanic adults say they worry daily or almost daily that a family member will become a victim of gun violence, and about 1 in 5 say that gun-related crimes, injuries and deaths are a constant threat to their local community.  Still, prevention measures are lacking.  About three-quarters of adults who have a gun in their home say it is stored in a way that bucks common gun-safety practices, such as in an unlocked location or already loaded, the new survey found. And only 5% of adults say that a health care professional has talked to them about gun safety.  The latest KFF survey is based on responses from a representative sample of about 1,300 adults that were collected in mid-March.

                      Almost 100 confirmed or probable cases of rare fungal infection linked to Michigan paper mill, health officials say
                  ","
                      Ninety-three confirmed or probable cases of blastomycosis have been identified in Michigan's Delta and Menominee counties, according to the local health department, and they are believed to be associated with a paper mill in the town of Escanaba. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is predominantly found in the Midwest and the South, particularly around the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes. There are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, according to the CDC. One analysis found 1,216 deaths related to the illness from 1990 to 2010. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won't get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Other symptoms may include chest pain, trouble breathing, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and muscle or joint pain, according to Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties. In rare cases, the infection can spread outside the lungs to places like the skin, bones, brain and spinal cord. Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person. It's treated with antifungal medication that must be taken for a period ranging from six months to a year, depending on the severity of the illness and the person's overall health.   Nineteen of the cases linked with Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill have been confirmed by culture or microscope, and the other 74 are probable, meaning the person has symptoms of blastomycosis and a positive antigen or antibody test, the health department says. ""Although the source of the infection has not been established, we continue to take this matter very seriously and are following recommendations from health and government officials and implementing numerous, proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and visitors,"" Billerud Escanaba Mill Operations Vice President Brian Peterson said in a statement from the health department.

                      Some ready-to-eat salads with chicken or ham may contain potentially deadly listeria
                  ","
                      Certain brands of fresh ready-to-eat salads that include chicken or ham may also contain lettuce contaminated with listeria, a potentially deadly bacteria, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Revolution Farms of Caledonia, Michigan, voluntarily recalled lettuce produced and sold under the brand Revolution Farms on April 5, 2023, due to the potential for listeria contamination.  However, lettuce from that recall was used to create ready-to-eat salads under the brand names ""Fruit Ridge Farms"" and ""Bell's Bistro,"" according to a FSIS public health alert issued Monday.  The salads were shipped to retail locations in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. As yet, no confirmed reports of adverse reactions have been reported, however the FSIS is ""concerned some products may be in consumers' refrigerators,"" according to the alert.  ""Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,"" the alert advised. The potentially contaminated products are ""Fruit Ridge Farms White Chicken Caesar Salad""; ""Fruit Ridge Farms Chef Salad with Ham""; ""Bell's Bistro White Chicken Caesar Salad""; and ""Bell's Bistro Chef Salad with Ham."" Consumers can also identify the salads by looking for the numbers ""EST. 17050"" or ""P-17050,"" which should appear inside the USDA mark of inspection on the item, the alert said. Listeria is a hardy germ, so determined to stick around that it can continue to grow while refrigerated, which even its fellow foodborne bacterial threats salmonella and E. coli cannot do. Listeria contamination can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects pregnant people and newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. In the United States, listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness, killing about 260 people a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Even with adequate antibiotic treatment, the disease has a high mortality rate"" of 20% to 30%, the US Food and Drug Administration said. Pregnant people are about 10 times more likely to become sick from listeria, and the illness can be fatal to a fetus. Pregnant Hispanics are at highest risk, likely due to eating traditional soft cheeses such as queso fresco and other foods made with milk that is unpasteurized, the FDA said. Foods made with raw milk are 50 to 160 times more likely to contain listeria, the agency said. Adults and healthy children with listeria infections may simply develop a mild or unpleasant illness that will not require hospitalization or antibiotics. However, anyone immunocompromised — including older adults, organ transplant patients, and those with cancer, kidney disease, diabetes or HIV/AIDS — can become seriously ill and die.

                      Many people don't know their blood type. Here's how to find out yours
                  ","
                      Is your blood type A, B, a combination of the two, or something else? You don't know, you say? Many people are in the same boat. In fact, only 62% of Americans reported knowing their blood type, according to a 2020 CBS News poll.  Those letters (and pluses and minuses) can be crucial information in an emergency, and there are simple but accurate ways to find out. Most blood types are only compatible with a handful of others, according to Dr. Dayand Borge, Divisional Chief Medical Officer at the American Red Cross.  Accidental incompatible blood transfusions, while rare, can be dangerous, Borge said. Luckily, there are easy ways to find out your blood type.  Ask your parents or doctor Before you go out of your way to try any of the other methods, check with your parents first. They may know or have old health records that include your blood type. You can also reach out to your health care provider, who may have that information on file. Blood draw Next time you go in to get your blood drawn, ask to know your blood type. If you've had blood drawn in the past, you can call the lab to see if they have the information. To request a blood test, visit your healthcare provider or a local health clinic. At-home blood test You can also purchase an at-home blood test online and have it shipped to your door. The kit comes with a needle and a testing card to drop your blood on. For many at-home tests, results take only minutes. Blood donation When you donate blood, the blood goes through multiple tests, including blood type. After you've donated with the Red Cross, you're given a blood donor card which will give you access to your blood type when they test it. This takes a few days and is free. If you've donated in the past, you may be able to check your blood type on their website. Saliva test For those squeamish of needles, a saliva test can help you determine your blood type without having to draw blood.  About 80% of people secrete the same antigens that are in their blood in their saliva, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research.  This means that the test is effective for most, but not everyone. These tests can be found online and cost more than traditional, at-home blood tests.

                      How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs
                  ","
                      A federal judge in Texas ruled on Friday to suspend the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process, nationwide by the end of this week.  The judge sided with the coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations that filed the lawsuit. He argued that the FDA failed to adequately consider risks associated with the drug, including ""the intense psychological trauma and post-traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion.""  However, data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That's a death rate of 0.0005%. Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.  ""[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,"" said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Its safety is very well established."" The Justice Department, the FDA, and Danco — a manufacturer of mifepristone that intervened in the case — have already appealed the ruling. Within hours of the decision in Texas, a federal judge in Washington state issued a conflicting ruling that the federal government must keep mifepristone available in the 17 Democrat-led states and the District of Columbia that had sued in a separate lawsuit. If the Texas ruling is allowed to take effect this week, 40 million more women of reproductive age would lose access to medication abortion care around the country, according to data from abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. That's in addition to the 24.5 million women of reproductive age living in states with abortion bans. ""The court's disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation,"" said Dr. Jack Resneck, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, in a statement. ""By rejecting medical facts, the court has intruded into the exam room and has intervened in decisions that belong to patients and physicians."" Weighing medication abortion against the alternatives Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.   The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion.  ""It reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,"" she said.  It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications. The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%. If access to mifepristone is cut off, abortion clinics and telehealth organizations could pivot to misoprostol-only abortions, Aiken told CNN. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said. In the latest study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol.  Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen. ""It's clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,"" said Aiken. Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it's readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN.  However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions. ""It's possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,"" said Upadhyay. ""Then by the time they get back to the clinic, they're seeking abortion later in pregnancy."" Before the ruling, 19 states already restricted telehealth abortion care, limiting access to medication abortion. Nearly half of US adults were unsure whether medication abortion was currently legal in their state as of late-January, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Experts say that confusion will only be exacerbated. ""People are not going to be sure mifepristone or misoprostol in fact, is available. I think it's going to be confusing,"" said Aiken. ""As people look around for options or feel unsure about their options, they may end up delaying [care].""

                      Why you keep having the same dream
                  ","
                      For years, dreams of my teeth cracking, loosening or falling out plagued my sleep. Loved ones of mine have repeatedly dreamed of flying, rolling away in a self-operating car, or running late for school or work. These aren't typical nightmares, which usually happen once. They're some of the most common recurring dreams, which tend to lean negative and can take some work to overcome.  ""Recurring dreams are likelier to be about very profound life experiences or just very character logic issues that are kind of guaranteed to recur in waking life because they're part of you rather than a one-time event,"" said dream researcher Deirdre Barrett, a lecturer of psychology in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.  Since our dreams typically don't repeat themselves, all it takes is dreaming the same dream twice or more for it to be considered recurring, Barrett said. They're more common in childhood, Barrett said, but can last into adulthood. And recurring dreams don't always happen in close proximity to each other — they can pop up multiple times per month or years apart, Barrett said.  Recurring dreams might be the same every time, or they might just recycle the same types of scenarios or worries, experts said.  ""It is difficult to assess the prevalence of recurrent dreams because it is not something that happens on a regular basis for most people,"" said clinical psychologist Dr. Nirit Soffer-Dudek, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, via email. ""And when people are asked about past dreams in their life, they may be influenced by memory distortions, interest in dreams (or lack thereof), or other factors.""  Regardless, anything that comes up repeatedly is worth investigating, said sleep medicine specialist Dr. Alex Dimitriu, founder of Silicon Psych, a psychiatry and sleep medicine practice in Menlo Park, California.  ""People have this kind of touch-and-go approach with things that are uncomfortable or fear-inducing, and I think dreams are, in some way, the same way,"" Dimitriu said. ""As a psychiatrist, I'm inclined to say that there is some message that might be trying to be conveyed to you. And the answer, then, might be to figure out what that is. And I think when you do, you might be able to put the thing to rest.""  Here's how to figure out what's triggering your recurring dreams.  What's in a dream?  For some recurring dreams, the message is straightforward — if you repeatedly dream about running late for school or work, you're probably just often nervous about being unprepared for those things. But others, despite their commonness, might not have a universal meaning, requiring you do some soul-searching to learn more.  ""In interpretation, we really don't believe there are universal symbols, but that (it's) what an individual's own sort of personal symbol system is and their associations to something are,"" Barrett said.  In addition to unpreparedness, other common themes of recurring dreams include social embarrassment, feeling inadequate compared with others, and danger in the form of car crashes or natural disasters, Barrett and Dimitriu said.  Some people have dreams revolving around test anxiety even if they haven't been in school in years, Barrett said. This can reflect a general fear of failure or a sense of being judged by authority figures. Dreams of tooth loss or damage might have to do with loss of something else in your life, feelings of hopelessness or defenselessness, or health concerns.  When faced with a recurring dream, ask yourself what the message could be, Dimitriu said. What is your relationship to the things or people in the dream? What are your fears and belief systems about those things? What are the top five things in your life that might be triggering it or related to it? What are you really worried about?  ""I definitely think it's fine to do informal dream interpretation, either on your own or with a close, trusted person who may just sort of see things to question in it that you don't,"" Barrett said.  People with post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety are more likely to have recurring dreams, especially ones with anxious natures, Dimitriu said. A PTSD dream stems from a trauma so severe it keeps returning as a nightmare.  ""The brain is trying to resolve something and lay it to rest,"" he added. But ""in people with PTSD, their dreams are so vivid that they wake them up from sleep. And that becomes the problem because the dream never gets processed. ... And that's why it recurs — it's unfinished work.""  Sometimes recurring dreams can point to biological sources, too. ""People with sleep apnea will report dreams of, like, drowning, suffocating, giant waves, gasping for air, being underwater or being choked,"" Dimitriu said, when they're actually experiencing breathing interruptions because of their condition.   There can be environmental triggers as well, such as a car alarm down the street or a dripping faucet, he added, which can set off dreams with imagery of those things. How to cope  Once you have a better sense of what your worries are, writing about them before bed can be helpful for alleviating negative recurring dreams and stress in general.  ""For my patients and myself, journaling is such a powerful tool,"" Dimitriu said. Meditating could also help.  When you know what fear is behind your dream, Dimitriu recommended processing it via a three-column method used in cognitive behavioral therapy: What is your automatic thought? What's your automatic feeling? Lastly, what's the more reality-based alternative thought?  Dream rehearsal therapy, also known as imagery rehearsal therapy, can be effective for both recurring dreams and nightmares. This approach involves writing down in detail the narrative elements of the dream, then rewriting it so it ends positively. Right before falling asleep, you'd set the intention to re-dream by saying aloud, ""If or when I have the beginnings of the same bad dream, I will be able to instead have this much better dream with a positive outcome.""  If your recurring dreams are making you stressed or unhappy, causing other symptoms, or starting to impair your ability to function on a regular basis, it's time to seek professional help, experts said.  There could be another reason Recurring dreams could also stem from poor sleep hygiene, Soffer-Dudek said.  ""A lot of awkward things happen in the night when people are sleep deprived, drink caffeine too late, drink alcohol too late, worked too late or slept four hours last night because they stayed up too late,"" he said. ""The fundamental core and foundation of healthy dream life starts with healthy sleep.""  Dimitriu also recommended limiting distractions that interfere with your time to reflect and process, such as spending unnecessary time on your phone or always filling the silence.  When your mind is always occupied, ""what happens is all that processing has to happen somewhere,"" he said. ""So now there's more pressure for that to happen in your dream life.""

Her 15-year-old son, Noah, was born on the way to the hospital.  ""My fifth child was born on the side of the highway,"" Wright said. ""It was wintertime, and my hospital at the time in California was about 40 minutes away, and the roads were icy, so we didn't make it in time.""   By the time she and Noah got to the hospital, about 15 minutes after he was born, his body temperature was lower than normal.  ""It worries me not to have a doctor there and worries me to have to go through that,"" Wright said.  Residents of Bonner County aren't the only ones dealing with unexpected maternity unit closures.   Since 2011, 217 hospitals in the United States have closed their labor and delivery departments, according to a report by the health care consulting firm Chartis. A CNN tally shows that at least 13 such closures have been announced in the past year alone.   Closures nationwide Services provided at maternity units vary from hospital to hospital. Most  offer obstetrics care in which an obstetrician will deliver a baby, either vaginally or via cesarean section. These units also provide perinatal care, which is medical and supportive care before and after delivery.  Other services provided may include lactation specialists and private delivery rooms.  After May 19, Bonner General Health will no longer offer obstetrical services, meaning there will be zero obstetricians practicing there. Consequently, the hospital will no longer deliver babies. Additionally, the unit will no longer provide 24-hour anesthesia support or post-resuscitation or pre-transportation stabilization care for critically ill newborns.  Some hospitals that have recently closed their maternity units still offer perinatal care, along with routine gynecological care.  Bonner General is planning to establish a clinic where perinatal care will be offered. Gynecological services -- such as surgical services, preventative care, wellness exams and family planning -- will still be provided at a nearby women's health clinic.  The Chartis report says that the states with the highest loss of access to obstetrical care are Minnesota, Texas, Iowa, Kansas and Wisconsin, with each losing more than 10 facilities.  Data released last fall by the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes also shows that more than 2.2 million women of childbearing age across 1,119 US counties are living in ""maternity care deserts,"" meaning their counties have no hospitals offering obstetric care, no birth centers and no obstetric providers.   Maternity care deserts have been linked to a lack of adequate prenatal care or treatment for pregnancy complications and even an increased risk of maternal death for a year after giving birth.  Money is one reason why maternity units are being shuttered.   According to the American Hospital Association, 42% of births in the US are paid for by Medicaid, which has low reimbursement rates. Employer-sponsored insurance pays about $15,000 for a delivery, and Medicaid pays about $6,500, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care cost and utilization data.  ""Medicaid funds about half of all births nationally and more than half of births in rural areas,"" said Dr. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health researcher at the University of Minnesota who has conducted research on the growing number of maternity care deserts.  Kozhimannil says communities that are most likely to be affected by maternity unit closures tend to be remote towns in rural counties in states with ""less generous Medicaid programs.""  Hospitals in larger cities are often able to offset low reimbursement rates from Medicaid births with births covered by employer-sponsored insurance, according to Dr. Sina Haeri, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and CEO of Ouma Health, a company that provides virtual prenatal and perinatal care to mothers living in maternity care deserts.   Many large hospitals also have neonatal intensive care units.   ""If you have a NICU, that's a substantial revenue generator for a hospital,"" Haeri said.   Most rural hospitals do not have a NICU, only a nursery where they care for full-term, healthy babies, he said. Due to that financial burden, it does not make financial sense for many rural hospitals to keep labor and delivery units open.   A low volume of births is another reason for the closures.   In announcing the closure, Bonner General noted that in 2022, it delivered just 265 babies, which the hospital characterized as a significant decrease.   Rural hospital administrators providing obstetric care say it takes at least 200 births annually for a unit to remain safe and financially viable, according to a study led by Kozhimannil for the University of Minnesota's Rural Health Research Center.   Many administrators surveyed said they are working to keep units open despite low birth rates.   ""Of all the folks that we surveyed, about a third of them were still operating, even though they had fewer than 200 births a year,"" Kozhimannil said. ""We asked why, and they said, 'because our community needs it.' ""     Another issue for hospital administrators is staffing and recruitment.     The decision to close Bonner General's labor and delivery unit was also directly affected by a lack of experienced, qualified doctors and nurses in the state, said Erin Binnall, a Bonner General Health spokesperson.   ""After May 19th, Bonner General Health will no longer have reliable, consistent pediatric coverage to manage neonatal resuscitations and perinatal care. Bonner General's number one priority is patient safety. Not having board-certified providers certified in neonatal resuscitation willing to provide call and be present during deliveries makes it unsafe and unethical for BGH to provide these services,"" Binnall told CNN by email.   The American Hospital Association acknowledges the staffing challenges some hospitals face.    ""Simply put, if a hospital cannot recruit and retain the providers, nurses, and other appropriately trained caregivers to sustainably support a service then it cannot provide that care,"" the association said in a statement. ""Such challenges are only magnified in rural America, where workforce strain is compounded by aging demographics that in some communities has dramatically decreased demand for services like Labor and Delivery.""  More stringent abortion laws may be playing a role in the closures, too.   Bonner General said in a news release last month that due to Idaho's ""legal and political climate, highly respected, talented physicians are leaving. In addition, the Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care.""   According to the Guttmacher Institute, Idaho has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country: a complete ban that has only a few exceptions.   Idaho requires an ""affirmative defense,"" Guttmacher says, meaning a provider ""has to prove in court that an abortion met the criteria for a legal exception.""  No matter the reason, Kozhimannil said, closures in rural communities aren't just a nuisance. They also put families at risk.   ""That long drive isn't just an inconvenience. It actually is associated with health risks,"" she said. ""The consequence that we saw is an increase in preterm births. Preterm birth is the largest risk factor for infant mortality. It is a huge risk factor for developmental and cognitive delays for kids.""   Haeri says the decline in maternal care also has a clear effect on maternal mortality rates.   The maternal death rate for 2021 -- the year for which the most recent data is available -- was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in the US, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020, according to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics. In raw numbers, 1,205 women died of maternal causes in the US in 2021.   Conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes may raise a person's risk of complications, as can being pregnant with multiples, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pregnant women over the age of 35 are at a higher risk of pre-eclampsia.  Searching for solutions   As labor and delivery units continue to shut their doors, possible solutions to the growing problem are complex, Haeri says.   ""I think anyone that comes to you and says the current system is working is lying to you,"" he said. ""We all know that the current maternity system is not good.""    Kozhimannil's research has found that many women who live in maternity care deserts are members of minority communities.   ""When we conducted that research, we found the communities that were raising the alarm about this ... tended to be Black and indigenous, or tribal communities in rural places,"" she said. ""Black communities in the South and East and tribal communities throughout the country, but especially in the West, Mountain West and Midwest.""   Haeri says one possible solution is at a woman's fingertips.    ""I always say if a woman's got a cell phone, she should have access,"" he said.    A 2021 study found that women who live in remote areas of the US could benefit from telehealth visits, which would decrease the number of ""in-person prenatal care visits and increase access to care.""   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 12 to 14 prenatal care appointments for women with low-risk pregnancies, and the study suggests that expansion of prenatal telehealth appointments could help women living in remote areas better adhere to those guidelines.    Ouma works with mothers who are typically remote and high-risk, Haeri says.     He also believes that promoting midwifery and doula services would help bolster maternity care in the US.    Certified nurse midwives often assist remote mothers who are high-risk or who decide to give birth at home, he says.    Midwives not only deliver babies, they often work with medical equipment and can administer at-home physical exams, prescribe medications, order lab and diagnostic tests, and assess risk management, according to the American College of Nurse Midwives. Doulas -- who guide mothers through the birthing process -- are often present at home births and even hospital births.   ""That midwifery model shines when it comes to maternal care. [And] doula advocacy involvement leads to better outcomes and maternity care, and I think as a system,

                      What is mifepristone, the drug at the heart of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit?
                  ","
                      A federal judge in Texas has said he will suspend the approval of mifepristone, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades, although he is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal.  The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claims that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn't study it enough to approve it. Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.  Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it's sometimes known as RU 486. How mifepristone works Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.  This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.  How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country's most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone's safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.  Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra -- used to treat erectile dysfunction -- is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn't have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.  Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are ""exceedingly rare,"" happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations' amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US.  Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own.  The only use of misoprostol that's approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it ""off-label"" by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor.  Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a ""reasonable"" option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective.  This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization.  People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, said Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Massachusetts and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. ""Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,"" Wong said. ""Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.""

                      Popular Easter candy Peeps contains additive linked to cancer, Consumer Reports says
                  ","
                      Most convenient store shelves are well stocked with sugary marshmallow chicks and bunnies in time for Easter.  The original yellow-colored chick is still the best-selling product sold under the Peeps brand, but the popular springtime candy brand is being criticized for containing red dye No. 3 in its pink- and purple-colored candies. Consumer Reports called out several Peeps candies as containing the dye that it said is ""a known carcinogen,"" according to a Monday news release from the nonprofit.  Consumer Reports sent a letter on March 17 to Just Born Quality Confections, which makes the candy, asking for a response by the end of the month. Consumer Reports said the company did not announce ""any plans to change its manufacturing process."" In a statement to CNN via email, Just Born said, ""FD&C Red #3 is currently an approved colorant for use in candy by the (US Food and Drug Administration). We manufacture all our candies in compliance with FDA regulations, sourcing our ingredients and packaging exclusively from reputable suppliers who adhere to high quality and safety standards.""   The company noted that the ingredients are listed on packaging and websites.  Just Born added that its product development team is ""continually exploring opportunities to provide expanded options for our consumers, including colors derived from natural sources that can deliver the same visual impact and stability as their certified counterparts."" Consumer Reports has started a petition for the removal of the colorant in Peeps. ""The widespread use of Red Dye 3 is particularly concerning since it is found in many products marketed to children who are especially at risk of developing health problems from exposure,"" said Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist for Consumer Reports, in a statement. ""Just Born Quality Confections should stop making its iconic marshmallow treats with this dangerous food chemical since other less risky alternatives are readily available,"" Hansen added. This move is not the first push to ban red dye No. 3. In October, Consumer Reports joined more than 20 other organizations to urge the FDA to remove the color additive from its approved list of ingredients.  Recently, a California State Assembly bill was introduced that would ban the sale of food products containing red dye No. 3 and other food additives thought to be harmful by January 2025. The confectionery industry's trade group, of which Just Born is a member, said US companies follow government standards.  ""Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy, as they have been for centuries. Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we do not use any ingredients in our products that do not comply with the FDA's strictest safety standards,"" said Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president of public affairs and communications at the National Confectioners Association, via email.  ""Chocolate and candy companies will continue to innovate as new information becomes available and consumer preferences change,"" Gindlesperger added. What is known about red dye No. 3 Nearly 3,000 food products contain the red colorant, according to the Food Scores database created by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization. Red dye No. 3 is approved for use in food and oral drug forms but has been banned in cosmetics since 1990 due to a carcinogenic response in rats. A 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment found that the consumption of red dye No. 3 can cause hyperactivity and other behavioral difficulties in children, concluding that some may be more sensitive than others. And a study published in 2012 suggested that the common food dye can cause cancer in animals, although there is no evidence that it is the same case for humans. While the yellow Peeps do not contain the red dye, concerned consumers should check food labels of other candies when putting together this year's Easter baskets. Any food products containing red dye No. 3 will have the additive listed as FD&C Red #3, as required by the FDA.

                      Life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth risks can vary depending on where you live, study finds
                  ","
                      The risks of severe complications during pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum can vary drastically depending on where the person lives, a new study suggests. Among people with Medicaid insurance in the United States, rates of severe maternal morbidity -- life-threatening complications during pregnancy, delivery or after childbirth -- range dramatically from about 80 cases for every 10,000 live births in Utah to more than 200 per 10,000 in the District of Columbia, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.  That means rates of severe complications were about 2.5 times higher in DC than in Utah.  ""We expected some variation at the state level. We didn't necessarily think it was going to be a three-fold difference. So that was a pretty striking finding,"" said lead study author Dr. Lindsay Admon, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School and obstetrician-gynecologist at U-M Health Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital. In the United States, attention is growing on maternal death rates and the fact that the nation has the highest rate of mothers dying in pregnancy or childbirth than other high-income countries. Just last month, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that the rising US maternal death rate climbed significantly yet again in 2021, reaching 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 23.8 in 2020. But maternal morbidity remains a public health issue too, Admon said. ""Maternal morbidity is 70 times more common than mortality,"" she said. ""These are severe adverse events as well, and I think these are the first time we've really had broad scale data at the state level about what the leading factors are in individual states."" Where severe maternal morbidity is highest The study authors -- from the University of Michigan, Boston University, Columbia University and the University of Minnesota -- analyzed Medicaid data on 4.8 million live births across 49 states and Washington, DC, from 2016 to 2018. They examined overall and state-level rates of severe maternal morbidity, occurring within 42 days before or after delivery.  ""The data that we were able to put together reflects nearly half of all births occurring during the study period,"" Admon said. Medicaid finances 41% of births in the United States. The data showed that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity among pregnant Medicaid patients, that did not involve blood transfusions, was 146.2 cases for every 10,000 deliveries -- and those rates ranged depending on where the person lived. The five states with the lowest rates of severe maternal morbidity, according to the data, were Utah, with a rate of 80.3 per 10,000; Maryland at 81.3; Rhode Island at 84.4; Nebraska at 88; and New Hampshire at 91.1. The jurisdictions with the highest rates were Washington, DC, at 210.4 per 10,000; California at 190.5; Nevada at 187.1; New Jersey at 180.6; and New York at 174.6. The most frequently identified cause of complications for patients was eclampsia, a serious condition involving high blood pressure during pregnancy, which can lead to seizures. Other leading causes of complications were acute respiratory distress in which fluid collects in the lungs, abnormal blood clotting and sepsis, a serious complication of an infection. ""For states where sepsis or severe infection is a leading indicator of maternal morbidity, an intervention might be to really focus their resources on early treatment of sepsis, on patient and community awareness of what sepsis is, and what the signs and symptoms are to look out for to seek care,"" Admon said. ""In many states, eclampsia, which is a severe complication of hypertension in pregnancy resulting in a seizure, was a leading cause of morbidity, and in those states, I would hope that folks would think 'OK, we really need to educate our population, our clinicians about hypertension in pregnancy,' "" she said. ""We know that complications from chronic conditions are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, and individuals in the US have been giving birth at older ages -- with more chronic conditions, with more severe chronic conditions -- for the last couple of decades."" 'There's a huge racial disparity' The types of complications that can happen during pregnancy or childbirth also appeared to vary when the data was analyzed by race.  ""When we looked at the leading causes of morbidity among the Black and White populations among Medicaid beneficiaries, basically, eclampsia was leading among the non-Hispanic Black population and sepsis among the non-Hispanic White,"" Admon said. However, Black patients still had a higher rate of sepsis than White patients.  ""There are six things that occur at higher rates among the non-Hispanic Black population,"" Admon said: eclampsia, heart failure, acute kidney failure, respiratory distress, sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which causes blood clotting. In states where race and ethnicity data were available, the researchers found that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity was 2.1 per 100 live births among Black patients with Medicaid, compared with 1.3 per 100 live births among White patients. ""The research really highlights that we have a long way to go still towards achieving maternal health equity in the US,"" Admon said. ""I think it's structural racism and that there's a great deal of implicit and explicit bias that happens with health care, and those are really important issues that we need to tackle."" The findings came as no surprise to Dr. Zsakeba Henderson, senior health adviser for the nonprofit National Institute for Children's Health Quality in Boston, an expert on maternal and infant health inequities. ""The main reason why I'm not surprised is that we already know that there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality in our country, with Black women three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes,"" said Henderson, who was not involved with the new research. ""And the main disparities that we see in mortality, we also see in morbidity."" In other words, the factors behind racial disparities seen in maternal mortality could be some of the same factors driving state-by-state differences in severe maternal morbidity rates.  For example, the area with the highest morbidity rates in the new study was Washington, DC. According to a report released last year by the DC Maternal Mortality Review Committee, nearly all of the pregnancy-related deaths in DC -- 90% -- were among Black mothers, even though they constitute roughly half of all births there. ""So to see that DC had the highest morbidity was not surprising to me at all,"" Henderson said.  ""We can't deny the fact that there's a huge racial disparity, and so I suspect that states that have higher populations of Black pregnant moms, who tend to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, are likely to have higher numbers of severe morbidity,"" she said.  The new findings can help guide discussions around what needs to be done to reduce rates of maternal morbidity in the United States, as well as the disparities by state and race, said Dr. Sarosh Rana, section chief of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine, who was not involved in the new study. ""It's nice to have this data for people who are policymakers at the level of the state but also physicians and institutional leaders like myself. This data will help guide implementation of quality improvement initiatives and provide equitable care,"" Rana said.   The new study is ""eye-opening"" and ""can begin to inform clinical care, quality improvement, and policy change with regard to maternal morbidity and mortality,"" Dr. Doee Kitessa, a general obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center and an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said in an email Thursday. ""This study can help hospitals and states target quality improvement initiatives toward the leading indicator of severe maternal morbidity,"" said Kitessa, who was not involved with the research. ""While the data is based on billing codes and not patient charts, it's an excellent start to understanding the causes of maternal morbidity by state and the disparities that exist,"" she said. ""This can help states and healthcare institutions begin to address and work to decrease the rates of severe maternal morbidity that are affecting the patients they care for."" 'It is important to listen to patients' Some policies have been introduced to tackle the United States' maternal health crisis. At the federal level, the Black Maternal ""Momnibus"" Act of 2021, a sweeping bipartisan package of bills, aims to provide pre- and post-natal support for Black mothers, such as by extending eligibility for certain benefits postpartum.  Yet within individual health care systems, it's important for physicians and leaders to pay attention to disparities in obstetrical care, Rana said, and among other factors that can lead to disparities, a key component is implicit bias in the care of Black women.  ""I think it is important to listen to patients when they raise concerns and for expecting mothers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy or childbirth complications. There are actually lots of signs that doctors should be talking about and that patients should be aware of,"" Rana said, adding that common warning signs of preeclampsia and eclampsia, for instance, are headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and swelling of the hands or face.  ""What I feel is, sometimes there's a gap between a patient complaining and the doctor listening. There is so much data showing that patients, especially African American Black patients, are not always listened to,"" she said. ""That's another barrier that a lot of our patients face, and it contributes to racial disparities.""

                      FDA takes only drug for premature birth off the market
                  ","
                      On Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration announced its final decision to withdraw its approval of Makena, a drug approved more than a decade ago to reduce the risk of preterm birth that had been the only medication approved for the condition.  The FDA says that the drug is not effective and that the benefits of taking it do not outweigh the risks.  ""It is tragic that the scientific research and medical communities have not yet found a treatment shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes -- particularly in light of the fact that this serious condition has a disparate impact on communities of color, especially Black women,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. ""Fundamentally, however, the touchstone of FDA drug approval is a favorable benefit-risk assessment; without that favorable assessment, the drug should not have the status of being FDA-approved."" About 1 in 10 infants born in the US are preterm, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. The lungs and brain finish developing in the last few months of pregnancy, and preterm birth places the baby and the mother at higher risk of death and disability.  The condition disproportionately affects Black women, for whom the rate is about 50% higher than the rate for White or Hispanic women, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Preterm birth has also been a growing problem in the US. The CDC says the rate rose 4% from 10.1% in 2020 to 10.5% in 2021. Before Makena, there were no reliable medication options for these patients, so it went through the FDA's accelerated approval process. That process is used when there's no reliable treatment for a condition and a drug shows promise in clinical trials. The FDA created it in the height of the AIDS epidemic, when people were dying in record numbers with no options. Accelerated approval means a drug doesn't have to go through all the levels of testing in humans that are required for the standard approval process.  Makena was approved in 2011 for women who have a history of spontaneous preterm delivery after a clinical trial showed a reduction in the rate of preterm births but no direct clinical benefit.  One condition of accelerated approval is that, even after the drug hits the market, the company must continue to test it in people to make sure it works.  In the years since Makena was approved, drugmaker Covis says, about 350,000 women have been treated with it. But a large 2019 study failed to show that it actually prevented preterm birth.  In October 2020, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research met to take a closer look at the research, and it recommended that the FDA withdraw approval for the drug.  The drug and its generic equivalents were allowed to remain on the market until the manufacturer removed them or the FDA commissioner mandated removal.  In October, the FDA's Obstetrics, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted that Makena should not remain on the market. It also voted that a postmarket trial didn't show any benefit to babies and that the evidence didn't show that Makena reduced the risk of preterm birth in women who had had one before. Last month, Covis said it was moving to withdraw the medication from the market. Covis said that soon after the committee hearing, it outlined a plan for withdrawal that included a wind-down period allowing patients to finish the 21-week course of treatment. However, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research rejected the plan. ""While we stand by Makena's favorable risk-benefit profile, including its efficacy in women at highest risk of preterm birth, we are seeking to voluntarily withdraw the product and work with the FDA to effectuate an orderly wind-down,"" Covis Pharma Chief Innovation Officer Dr. Raghav Chari said in a news release at the time. Effective Thursday, the FDA says, Makena and its generics are no longer approved and cannot lawfully be distributed in interstate commerce. The FDA said that although the approvals of Makena and its generics have been withdrawn, it recognizes that a supply of product has been distributed. It said patients who have questions should talk to their health care provider.  Dr. Sean Blackwell, chair of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences with UTHealth Houston, said he understands that the FDA does not want to expose people to risk or to unnecessary cost, but he disagrees with the interpretation of the research and the decision to withdraw the drug from the market.  ""I certainly have had some women that had a prior preterm birth, and then I put them on Makena and had good outcomes. So for those patients, they're going to be  distressed that they used a medication and it worked for them, and now it's no longer available,"" he said.  There are no good options, he said. ""Doctors are going to want to do something. They're not going to just be OK with saying, 'there's nothing we can do. We'll just sit on our hands,' "" Blackwell said. The other medication alternative is vaginal progesterone, he said, but trials have shown that it is not necessarily effective, either.  Doctors may have to rely on surgical approaches to prevent preterm birth, ""but it's surgery. It has side effects. It has risks,"" Blackwell said. ""I do think that going forward, it's going to be really hard.""

                      WHO official criticizes China's 'inexcusable' lack of transparency on pandemic's origins
                  ","
                      The World Health Organization still does not have key data from China about the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak, putting the world in jeopardy, says Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the group's Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging diseases. ""The lack of data disclosure is simply inexcusable,"" Van Kerkhove wrote in an editorial in the journal Science on Thursday. ""The longer it takes to understand the origins of the pandemic, the harder it becomes to answer the question, and the more unsafe the world becomes."" Understanding how the disease emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 would help prevent future outbreaks, Van Kerkhove said. It was only this year, three years after the start of the pandemic, that WHO got access to certain data that Chinese scientists had gathered in early 2020 at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. The raw genetic sequences from the samples had recently been uploaded to the data-sharing site GISAID. They were soon removed, but quick-thinking researchers had already noticed them and downloaded them for further study. An analysis of that material uncovered animal DNA in samples already known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. A significant amount of that DNA seemed to belong to animals known as raccoon dogs, which had been on sale at the market, WHO officials said in March. Although the sequences showed that the animal could have been an intermediate host and that the market amplified the spread of the virus, the data did not show that people who interacted with those animals got sick through that exposure. In other words, the findings did not settle the question of how the pandemic started. To do so, scientists would need to trace the animals to the source of the virus. WHO also needs access to test results from workers at the market.  Three years later, Van Kerkhove said, WHO still does not have access to the raw data China collected from early Covid-19 cases.  With China's advanced technical capabilities, she firmly believes, it has more essential information that it is not sharing.  Van Kerkhove says China could have more unshared information about things like the wild and farmed animal trade, the testing of humans and animals in Wuhan and across China, the operations of labs in Wuhan that worked with coronaviruses, and the first cases. The failure to share information, she said, only fuels politicization of the origin of the virus.  ""The world needs to move away from the politics of blame and, instead, exploit all diplomatic and scientific approaches so that the global scientific community can do what it does best -- collaborate, focus on this health crisis, and find evidence-based solutions to thwart future pandemics,"" Van Kerkhove wrote. It's still not clear whether the Covid-19 pandemic began with a lab leak or with spillover from animals. Many scientists believe that the virus naturally moved from animals to humans. Intelligence agencies like the US Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and the FBI endorse the theory that that virus spread out of a Chinese lab. Without more data from China from early in the pandemic, it may never be proved. This is not the first time Van Kerkhove has been vocal about China's lack of transparency about Covid, nor is she the only world leader to call on China to be forthcoming about the beginnings of the pandemic.  In March, Van Kerkhove described to Science WHO's late discovery of the Chinese data about the market as ""beyond infuriating,"" calling the lack of collaboration  ""scary as hell."" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of President Joe Biden's Covid task force during the presidential transition, said Van Kerkhove's editorial puts WHO on the record on the issue.  ""Will that be a compelling incentive for China to share more? No. They're going to do what they're going to do,"" Osterholm said.  ""I am not optimistic,"" he added. It will never be fruitful to spend time and attention on getting data from China to pinpoint what happened with Covid, Osterholm said.  ""My whole message is that we've got to prepare for lab leaks or spillover events,"" he said. WHO plans to publish a status report about what it knows about the origins of Covid-19 this year.  In the meantime, it's encouraging all countries, not just China, to share what they know to help solve the mystery and fight future pandemics. Collaboration is key, as is finding evidence-based solutions, Van Kerkhove believes.  ""Time is running out,"" she wrote.

                      CDC warns doctors to watch for Marburg virus amid outbreaks in two African nations
                  ","
                      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory Thursday about the Marburg virus outbreak in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania.  Marburg is a rare but highly fatal viral fever that causes uncontrolled bleeding, similar to Ebola. The CDC's warning says that although there are no cases in the United States and the current risk is low, health care providers should be on the lookout for any imported cases.  Providers who suspect that someone is sick with Marburg virus should take a detailed travel history, the CDC said. The patient should be managed under isolation until there is a negative test, and the local health department should be contacted immediately.  Marburg virus is not contagious until symptoms appear. These can include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms and unexplained bleeding.  It can spread through contact with an infected person's blood and other body fluids or through fluids from infected animals. It does not spread through the air like the virus that causes Covid-19.  There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the disease. Early intensive supportive care, the CDC said, may keep people from getting seriously ill or dying.  In March, the CDC warned travelers to Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania to avoid contact with sick people and to monitor their health for three weeks after visiting those countries. The agency posted notices in international airports reminding people to watch for symptoms and to see a doctor immediately if they feel sick. It's also sending text messages to travelers who have been in those countries.  The CDC has sent staff to Africa to help fight the outbreaks, which are the first reported in either Equatorial Guinea or Tanzania. Authorities were made aware of the outbreak in Equatorial Guinea in early February. On February 7, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for Equatorial Guinea announced that there had been a cluster of deaths in early January.  In late March, the Ministry of Health of Tanzania announced an outbreak in the northwest part of the country. As of April 5, there have been eight lab-confirmed cases, and five of those people have died. The CDC said there is no evidence to suggest that the two outbreaks are related. Most experts agree that these cases represent two independent animal-to-human spillover events.  In addition to avoiding areas where there are known outbreaks, there are ways to keep yourself safe from Marburg virus, the CDC said. Avoid contact with blood and bodily fluids from people who are sick. If attending a funeral for someone who has died from the disease, take care not to touch the body. Also avoid contact with fruit bats and primates in areas where there are outbreaks, since both animals are known to be carriers for the virus.

                      Late-stage RSV vaccine trials show 'exciting promise,' some scientists say
                  ","
                      A Pfizer vaccine to protect older adults and infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has shown what some scientists are calling ""exciting"" promise in late-stage trials. In one company-funded trial in adults 60 and older, the results of which were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the vaccine prevented RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness -- which includes acute bronchitis and pneumonia -- and prevented RSV-associated acute respiratory illness, with no apparent safety concerns. In another company trial, whose interim results were also published in the journal on Wednesday, the RSV vaccine was given during late-stage pregnancy and was found to be effective against severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, or inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs, in infants. There were no safety concerns identified. Pfizer is seeking the US Food and Drug Administration's approval for its RSV vaccine for older adults.  In a separate request, Pfizer has asked the FDA to approve its RSV vaccine with pregnant people to protect infants. The company says it expects that decision by August. The FDA is also considering a monoclonal antibody treatment that's designed to protect children up to 2 years old.  In March, vaccine advisers to the FDA voted in favor of approving RSV vaccine candidates from Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for adults over 60.  The vaccines could become the world's first if the FDA commissioner agrees with the advisory committee. Why an RSV vaccine is needed RSV is ubiquitous. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says most kids will catch this highly contagious respiratory virus at some point before they turn 2.  Although RSV is a mild infection for most, for some groups like infants and the elderly, it can be serious enough to cause hospitalization or death. ""When I started my residency 30 years ago, RSV season was literally a horrifying event for us in pediatrics,"" said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, who was not involved in the new studies.  Providers would work hard to save babies who were in the NICU for other reasons, she said, but when RSV season would come around, they'd lose many of those babies. ""It was just ... heartbreaking,"" Hoyen said.  The introduction of monoclonal antibodies for these most vulnerable infants made RSV survivable for many, but still some are lost to the virus.  Globally, about 64 million people get sick with RSV each year, and 160,000 die, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.  During last year's especially bad RSV season, some children's hospitals had to set up tents in their parking lots to deal with the overflow of patients. But even in a typical RSV season, hospitals stay busy. In a single year, there are about 34 million episodes of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections in children under the age of 5, and about 10% need to go to the hospital for treatment, studies show. In fact, the virus is the No. 1 reason infants in the US have to go to the hospital.  Tens of thousands of older adults are also hospitalized every year, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. RSV is costly, too. Every year, the US spends more than $709.6 million on hospitalization for infants with RSV alone, studies show. An inauspicious start There is no specific treatment for RSV. Some babies who are more vulnerable to severe disease can get a monoclonal antibody, but it's been difficult to administer and requires parents to come into the clinic at least once a month during RSV season. A vaccine would be incredibly helpful, doctors say, but trials have been stalled until recently. In the 1960s, a disastrous RSV vaccine effort using an inactivated virus saw the hospitalizations of 80% of vaccinated children who later caught RSV. Only 5% of the young participants who got a placebo were hospitalized.  Further trials were put on hold for years as scientists worked to determine what went wrong. In the meantime, the US government created more guardrails to make clinical trials safer going forward. A decade agom a research team at the National Institutes of Health figured out a key mechanism of the virus. Scientists could build on that knowledge to create safe vaccines that would recognize the virus when it invaded the body and trigger the body to develop strong protection against it.  The RSV vaccine race Until recently, four companies had RSV vaccines for seniors in the final phases of trials.  Johnson & Johnson's vaccine division, Janssen, was far along. But at the end of March, the company announced that it was abandoning its candidate.  J&J said the vaccine was lost in the company's ""broader effort to make strategic choices for its pipeline and research and development (R&D) investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients.""  That leaves Bavarian Nordic as the other company focused on a vaccine for the elderly. Results from its trial are expected in the middle of this year. The vaccines by the numbers When the FDA's independent vaccine advisers voted to recommend that the agency approve Pfizer and GSK's vaccines for seniors, the companies showed promising data. GSK's RSV vaccine candidate for older adults was 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease, according to a company-funded study published in NEJM in February. The shot was 94.1% effective at preventing severe disease. For Pfizer's vaccine for people 60 and older, Wednesday's studies showed 66.7% efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with two or more signs or symptoms and 85.7% vaccine efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with three or more signs or symptoms.  The study says there were not enough cases of severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, meaning hospitalization or a need for ventilation or extra oxygen, to derive that effectiveness. One reason may be that the trials were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, when there weren't as many RSV cases as usual, Dr. Ann Falsey said.  ""Event rates were low. So, for that reason, they just could not say that it decreased hospitalization, but in my mind, anything that prevents ARI, respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract infection will clearly lead to less hospitalizations. This makes immense sense, but they didn't prove it,"" said Falsey, who was involved in the new research and cares for elderly RSV patients. She is a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.  The Pfizer vaccine was considered safe, according to the study.  Among the 20,000 recipients in the trial, there was one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves, a week after vaccination. Company documents show that the case was considered life-threatening, but there may have been a compounding factor, because the person had a heart attack the day before doctors noted the Guillain-Barre. There was also a case of Miller-Fisher syndrome, another rare nerve disease that's considered a variant of Guillain-Barré. The person developed the disease eight days after vaccination but recovered after about a month and a half.  During the independent FDA advisers' discussion about the vaccine, Dr. Hana El Sahly, chair of the committee and a professor of virology at the Baylor College of Medicine, said that the two cases put the rate of the condition at about 1 in 9,000, which is much higher than what is seen in the general population.  A person in the GSK trial also developed Guillain-Barré nine days after getting the vaccine and spent six months in rehabilitation. The FDA considers the case possibly vaccine-related.  If the vaccines are approved, doctors say, it will be important to monitor their safety.  RSV vaccine for young children The interim results of Pfizer's vaccine for infants show that the candidate didn't meet the company's criteria, again most likely because the trial took place during the pandemic, when RSV cases were lower. But research is ongoing.  An editorial published alongside the study Wednesday from Dr. Ruth Karron says ""it is notable that the efficacy against severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness was 81.8% within 90 days after birth and 69.4% within 180 days after birth."" In other words, it didn't necessarily prevent infections, but it kept them from getting worse. Karron -- a professor in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Immunization Research and of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative, who was not involved in the new research -- wondered in the editorial whether this age of RSV vaccine development could be the ""beginning of the end"" of huge RSV outbreaks.  Another study published Wednesday in NEJM focused on nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody to prevent RSV made by AstraZeneca and Sanofi, which has been approved by the European Commission and the UK to prevent infants from getting sick with RSV. The companies have asked the FDA for approval to use the treatment to protect children up to age 2. This study found that through 150 days after injection, efficacy against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 76.8%, and efficacy against very severe medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 78.6%. Ultimately, in babies carried to term and in late-preterm infants, a single dose provided protection against hospitalization with RSV.  Hoyen thinks it will take a monoclonal antibody treatment as well as a vaccine to protect infants. Many pregnant women don't get vaccinated; at most, only 57% to 61% of pregnant people get shots to protect against the flu and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, according to a 2020 study from the CDC.  ""We try, but overall, we do not do a great job of vaccinating mothers when they're pregnant,"" Hoyen said. Now, it will be up to the government to decide how these vaccines and treatment should be used. Scientists will also be watching to see how long the vaccine provides protection in the next RSV season. Even with all those caveats, health care providers who treat people with RSV say, it's incredible news. ""I'm just unbelievably happy with all of these results. You know, for somebody who's been laboring in the field for more than 30 years, it's immensely satisfying to see both a vaccine for babies who need it and a vaccine for older adults. It's terrific,"" Falsey said.

                      Eating too much 'free sugar' has 45 negative health effects, study finds
                  ","
                      There are at least 45 good reasons to cut back on added sugar, according to a new study.  Copious research has shown the negative effects of excessive sugar intake on health, which has informed recommendations to limit consumption of ""free"" or added sugar to less than 10% of a person's daily caloric intake.  Still, researchers in China and the United States felt that before developing detailed policies for sugar restriction, the ""quality of existing evidence needs to be comprehensively evaluated,"" according to the study published Wednesday in the journal The BMJ.  In a large review of 73 meta-analyses — which included 8,601 studies — high consumption of added sugar was associated with significantly higher risks of 45 negative health outcomes, including diabetes, gout, obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, cancer, asthma, tooth decay, depression and early death. Free sugars — the type of sugar the authors focused on — are those added during the processing of foods; packaged as table sugar and other sweeteners; and naturally occurring in syrups, honey, fruit juice, vegetable juice, purees, pastes and similar products in which the cellular structure of the food has been broken down, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This category does not include sugars naturally occurring in dairy or structurally whole fruits and vegetables.  The study ""provides a useful overview of the current state of the science on sugar consumption and our health ... and confirms that eating too much sugar is likely to cause problems,"" said Dr. Maya Adam, director of Health Media Innovation and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. Adam wasn't involved in the study.   ""Studies like this are helpful in advising patients that seemingly small changes, such as cutting out excess sugar like sugar-sweetened beverages, can have a marked and positive improvement to health,"" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, who wasn't involved in the study. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that participants with the highest consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages had higher body weight than those with the lowest intake.  ""As a nutrition researcher who served on both the 2010 and 2020 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees, I can confirm that intake of dietary sugar in the US is more than twice the recommended amount (less than 10% of total daily caloric intake) and while the direct impact of sugar itself offers minimal, if any, nutritional benefits, it further replaces foods that do,"" said Linda Van Horn, professor emeritus of preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, via email. Van Horn wasn't involved in the study.  The connection between sugar and disease Evidence of a link between free sugar and cancer has been limited and controversial, and needs more research, the study's authors said. But the finding, according to the study, could be explained by the known effects of sugar on weight: High sugar consumption has been associated with obesity, which is a strong risk factor for various cancers. The same goes for cardiovascular disease. ""Added sugar intake can promote inflammation in the body, and this can cause stress on the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to increased blood pressure,"" behavioral scientist Brooke Aggarwal told CNN in February. Aggarwal, an assistant professor of medical sciences in the cardiology division at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, wasn't involved in the study.  Highly processed foods, which can have lots of free sugar, have been found to increase inflammation, a risk factor for depression.  ""Whole food carbohydrates take longer to break down into simple sugars, and a part of them — the fiber — can't be broken down at all,"" Adam told CNN in February. ""This means that whole, intact grains don't cause the same spikes in blood sugar that we experience when we eat simple sugars. Blood sugar spikes trigger insulin spikes, which can destabilize our blood glucose and ... be the underlying cause of health problems in the long run.""  Reducing your intake  The findings — in combination with existing guidance from the World Health Organization, World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research — suggest people should limit free sugar intake to less than 25 grams, or about 6 teaspoons, per day. There's that much sugar in 2 ½ chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch and about 1 ½ tablespoons of honey. A doughnut has around 15 to 30 grams of sugar, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  The authors also recommend reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to less than one serving (about 200 to 355 milliliters) per week. That's the equivalent of an up to 12-ounce soda, Aggarwal said via email.    To change sugar consumption patterns, the authors think ""a combination of widespread public health education and policies worldwide is urgently needed.""  But there are some changes you can begin making on your own.  Be aware of what you're putting in your body by reading nutrition labels when shopping — even the ones on foods you might not think of as sweet, such as bread, breakfast cereals, yogurts or condiments. These foods usually have lots of added sugar, and it adds up, Adam said.  Opt for water sweetened with fruit slices instead of sugary drinks and have fresh or frozen fruit for dessert instead of cakes, cookies or ice cream. Cooking and baking at home more often is one of the best ways to reduce sugar intake, Aggarwal said.  Getting enough good-quality sleep on a regular basis would also help ""as we tend to choose foods higher in sugar when we're tired,"" Aggarwal said. Cutting back gradually can help you train your taste buds to crave less sugar.  ""Our lives will probably end up being sweeter with less sugar in our diets,"" Adam said.

                      Biden administration finalizes rule to target 'misleading' Medicare Advantage ads
                  ","
                      US health officials have issued a final rule that not only makes some changes to Medicare -- including expanding access to behavioral health care and clarifying criteria guidelines -- it cracks down on ""misleading"" advertisements.  On Wednesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services, through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, finalized the rule that, among other things, prohibits advertisements that do not mention a specific plan name and use Medicare logos or language in a way that could mislead and confuse enrollees into believing that the ads come from the government. The measures are the latest in the Biden administration's efforts to rein in Medicare Advantage plans, which have been soaring in popularity. About half of Medicare participants are enrolled in these plans, which are run by insurers that contract with the federal government.  According to CMS, the ""proliferation of certain television advertisements"" promoting enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans -- which are offered by Medicare-approved private companies -- has been concerning.    ""Today, we're announcing a rule that will crack down on misleading marketing schemes by the health insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage plans, those that offer Part D prescription drug plans and their downstream entities. Among other provisions, the rule would prohibit overly general ads about the Medicare Advantage program that often tends to confuse and mislead those individuals who are eligible to apply for some of these insurance plans,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said Wednesday.  In general, about 65 million Americans are within the Medicare program, according to Becerra. ""Any marketing that does not specifically name a health plan, that misrepresents what a plan might offer within these commercials, is something that would now be prohibited,"" he said. ""That's going to be important because the confusion that often arises, and the changes that some enrollees often will make to their detriment in getting health care, are things that we want to try to avoid."" Last year, the Senate Finance Committee released a report highlighting an increase in such deceptive marketing practices that target seniors with Medicare Advantage plans and recommending that CMS take action to reduce the prevalence of such marketing tactics.   ""We've heard from many seniors and people with disabilities about misleading and confusing advertising for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. Today's final rule includes changes to protect people exploring Medicare Advantage and Part D coverage from confusing and potentially misleading marketing practices,"" Dr. Meena Seshamani, CMS deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicare, said Wednesday. ""We are finalizing 21 marketing provisions to protect beneficiaries."" Beyond marketing requirements, the final rule clarifies criteria guidelines to help ensure that people with Medicare Advantage receive access to the same ""medically necessary"" care they would receive with traditional Medicare.  The rule also expands the list of populations to which Medicare Advantage organizations must provide ""culturally competent"" services, such as people with limited English proficiency or those in the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the rule requires that a prior authorization approval for care remain valid for as long as ""medically necessary"" to avoid disruptions in care for beneficiaries. ""We are also finalizing new minimum wait time standards for behavioral health,"" Seshamani said, as well as requiring that most types of Medicare Advantage plans include behavioral health services. The American Hospital Association said in a statement Wednesday that it applauds the increased attention on Advantage plans. ""Hospitals and health systems have raised the alarm that beneficiaries enrolled in some Medicare Advantage plans are routinely experiencing inappropriate delays and denials for coverage of medically necessary care,"" said Ashley Thompson, the group's senior vice president for public policy analysis and development. ""This rule will go a long way in protecting patients and ensuring timely access to care, as well as reducing inappropriate administrative burden on an already strained health care workforce."" Protecting and strengthening Medicare is one of the administration's top priorities, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a news release Wednesday. ""With this final rule, CMS is putting in place new safeguards that make it easier for people with Medicare to access the benefits and services they are entitled to, while also strengthening the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs."" On Friday, CMS issued controversial final payment policies for 2024 that seek to limit overbilling by Medicare Advantage plans. The changes include updating the risk adjustment model to better ensure that payments are in line with patients' medical conditions and that insurers don't add diagnoses to inflate their billing.  Insurers protested the proposed rule vehemently, leading CMS to phase in the changes over three years, instead of one.

                      Sleep problems linked to fivefold rise in stroke risk, study says
                  ","
                      Snoring, snorting, tossing and turning, napping for a long time during the day, waking up during the night, and sleeping too little or even too much all contribute to poor-quality sleep and may raise your risk for stroke, according to a new study. In fact, researchers found the more sleep problems you have, the greater the risk of stroke. ""Having more than five of these symptoms may lead to five times the risk of stroke compared to those who do not have any sleep problems,"" said study author Christine McCarthy of the University of Galway in Ireland in a statement.  ""The findings are consistent with prior research linking unhealthy sleep to high blood pressure and to impairments to blood vessels, which are risk factors for stroke,"" said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the study. One reason may be the impact of short, fragmented sleep and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea on the body's ability to regulate metabolism, blood pressure and inflammation, which are all risk factors for stroke, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern's medical school, who was not involved in the study.  ""Poor sleep can impair the natural blood pressure dipping that occurs during night time sleep and contribute to hypertension — an important risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease,"" Zee said via email. ""In other population based research, similar relationships have been reported between poor sleep health and disorders such as diabetes, heart disease and dementia."" Sleep problems and stroke risk The study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, analyzed data from more than 4,500 people participating in INTERSTROKE, a large international case-control study of patients who have experienced a stroke.  Nearly 1,800 participants in the study had an ischemic stroke, the most common kind, in which a blood clot blocks an artery leading to the brain. Another 439 people had an intracerebral hemorrhage in which arteries or veins in the brain rupture, causing bleeding into brain tissue. Participants in the study were then matched by age and sex to people who had no history of stroke. Both groups answered questions about their sleep quality and behavior, and the two groups were compared. Results showed people who slept less than five hours a night on average were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who got seven hours of sleep — the recommended minimum for adults.  On the flip side, sleeping more than nine hours a night on average was associated with a twofold increase in stroke risk, according to a statement on the study. The results held true even after adjustments to eliminate other issues that can lead to stroke, including depression, alcohol abuse, smoking and a lack of physical activity, according to the study. Having sleep apnea — a condition in which people stop breathing multiple times per hour — was associated with a threefold increase in stroke risk, the statement said.  ""Sleep apnea can alter the pathways involved in the regulation of coagulation factors that can increase the risk of strokes,"" Zee said. Snoring or snorting, which can both be signs of untreated sleep apnea, were also risky. People who snored were 91% more likely to have suffered a stroke, while those who snorted were almost three times as likely to have had a stroke than those who did not.  Napping was also a risk factor, the statement said. People who on average napped more than an hour were 88% more likely to suffer a stroke than those who did not. However, taking a planned nap of less than an hour was not associated with an increased stroke risk, the study said. It's important to note that the research could only show an association between sleep problems and stroke, not causation, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""The question remains: Is poor quality sleep causative? Or is it simply associated with a cluster of bad health habits that would lead somebody to have a higher stroke risk?"" asked Freeman, who was not involved in the research. ""Are they under a lot of stress? Are they drinking huge amounts of caffeine and then not sleeping?  Maybe they're not exercising very much, and we know that exercise promotes good quality sleep,"" Freeman said. ""It's hard to tease out all the factors that might contribute."" What to do Practicing good sleep hygiene, eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise are all key ways to reduce the negative impact of sleep disorders and reduce stroke and cardiovascular risk, Freeman said. ""What I always tell people is, you know, getting about seven hours a night of uninterrupted sleep is associated with the least amount of cardiovascular disease,"" he said. It's important to prioritize getting those seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night on a regular basis, Zee said. Doing so means going to bed and waking at the same time every day, even on weekends. ""Regular exposure to light in the morning and afternoon can also improve sleep quality,"" she said, adding that anyone suffering from snoring, insomnia or excessive sleepiness during the day should talk to a sleep specialist. The bedroom should be used for sleeping and intimacy only, Freeman added.  ""Don't hang out in there and watch TV or read books or do work in there,"" he said. ""Keep a notebook next to the bed so if you wake up in the middle of the night you can write down what comes to mind. Diffuse any worries you have by meditating on it and do your best to let things go."" Don't drink alcohol or eat at least three hours before bed to avoid gastric distress that might wake you up, Zee suggested.  ""It's also important to exercise, preferably in the morning,"" Freeman added. ""The one true medicine that works always is improving one's lifestyle to include healthy behaviors.""

                      Gun violence in the US has become more lethal, research suggests
                  ","
                      A record number of people are dying from firearm injuries in the US, and new research suggests that shootings are becoming more lethal, too. Most victims of fatal firearm injuries die at the scene of the shooting, before they can be treated in a health care setting. But that has become increasingly common over the past two decades.  About 57% of firearm fatalities in 2021 occurred at the scene of the shooting, up 9% since 1999, according to a research letter published Wednesday in the JAMA Surgery journal. For this analysis, researchers used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and excluded suicides and other self-inflicted firearm injuries.  Nearly 49,000 people died from firearm injuries in the US in 2021, CDC data shows -- an unprecedented surge of about 23% over two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. And a shift in the type of firearms that are being bought and used is a key factor making shootings more lethal, experts say. ""It's leaning more and more towards military-grade, higher velocity, higher lethality type of weapons,"" said Dr. Eric Fleegler, an emergency physician at Boston Children's Hospital.  ""That includes larger magazine capacity so they can shoot more bullets, the ability to fire them at faster rates, and quite frankly, just bigger, faster bullets which cause more damage to a human body.""  Federal data shows that handguns are the most common murder weapon, used in more than half of all homicides that involve firearms. But rifles, such as the AR-15, are becoming more frequently used.  Nearly 4% of firearm homicides in 2021 involved a rifle, killing 447 people, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That's more than twice as many deaths and nearly twice as common compared to firearm homicides in 2015. Other external factors could also play a role in the location where a victim dies, such as increasing demand for ambulances that could affect emergency transportation options. Still, experts say that more -- and better -- data on gun violence is needed.  In the CDC data, for example, definitions to help differentiate location of death were lacking and many were coded as ""other"" or ""unknown."" And the true scope of America's gun epidemic is far broader than the deaths it causes, experts say.  ""Deaths from firearm injuries are horrible tragedies, but they are unfortunately just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Fleegler, who has studied gun violence but was not involved in this research. There are many others who suffer physically from gunshot wounds and a deep emotional toll on families and communities, he said, and more robust data is needed to understand that.  While there are more questions to be answered, experts say that this new research adds to evidence that an important step to reducing gun violence will involve addressing the types of guns that are available. ""It reiterates that maybe there should be a look at solutions which limit the magazine capacity and access to high-caliber weapons, as well,"" said Ari Davis, a policy advisor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

                      How to tell when stress is a problem Our medical expert explains
                  ","
                      As we mark Stress Awareness Month in April, I know there's so much to be stressed out—mass shootings, wars around the world, the pandemic's long-term effects and the daily stresses of living and working in the 21st century. I'm sure you've got your list. Everyone experiences stress at different points in their life. But when is stress a problem that requires our attention? What symptoms should people be on the lookout for? What are the health impacts of long-term stress? What are healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms? And what techniques can help in addressing—and preventing—stress? Fresh from dropping off my kid at school late (sorry, kid, my fault), I was looking forward to this advice from CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore's Health Commissioner and as Chair of Behavioral Health Systems Baltimore.   CNN: Let's start with the basics. What exactly is stress? Dr. Leana Wen: There is no single definition of stress. The World Health Organization's definition refers to a state of worry or tension caused by a difficult situation. Many people experience stress as mental or emotional strain. Others also have physical manifestations of stress. Stress is a natural reaction. It's a human response that prompts us to respond to challenges and perceived threats. Some stress can be healthy and can prompt us to fulfill obligations. Perceived stress can spur us to study for a test or complete a project by a certain deadline. Virtually everyone experiences that kind of stress to some extent.   CNN: Why can stress be a problem? Wen: The same human response that motivates us to work hard and finish a project can also lead to other emotions, like not being able to relax and becoming irritable and anxious. Some people develop physical reactions, like headaches, upset stomach and trouble sleeping. Longer-term stress can lead to anxiety and depression, and it can worsen symptoms for people with pre-existing behavioral health conditions, including substance use.   CNN: What are symptoms of stress that people should be on the lookout for?  Wen: In addition to feeling irritable and anxious, people experiencing stress can also feel nervous, uncertain and angry. They often express other symptoms, including feeling a lack of motivation; having trouble concentrating; and being tired, overwhelmed and burnt out. Many times, people in stressful situations will report being sad or depressed.   It's important to note that depression and anxiety are separate medical diagnoses. Someone with depression and/or anxiety could have their symptoms exacerbated when they are undergoing times in their life with added stress. Long-term stress can also lead to depression and anxiety.   One way to think about the difference between stress versus anxiety and depression is that stress is generally a response to an external issue. The external cause could be good and motivating, like the need to finish a project. It could also be a negative emotional stress, like an argument with a romantic partner, concerns about financial stability or a challenging situation at work. Stress should go away when the situation is resolved.   Anxiety and depression, on the other hand, are generally persistent. Even after a stressful external event has passed, these internal feelings of apprehension, unworthiness and sadness are still there and interfere with your ability to live and enjoy your life.   CNN: What are the health impacts of long-term stress? Wen: Chronic stress can have long-term consequences. Studies have shown that it can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke. It's associated with worse immune response and decreased cognitive function.   Individuals experiencing stress are also more likely to endorse unhealthy behaviors, like smoking, excessive drinking, substance use, lack of sleep and physical inactivity. These lifestyle factors in turn can lead to worse health outcomes.   CNN: What techniques can help in addressing stress? Wen: First, awareness is important. Know your own body and your reaction to stress. Sometimes, anticipating that a situation may be stressful and being prepared to deal with it can reduce stress and anxiety.   Second, identifying symptoms can help. For example, if you know that your stress reaction includes feeling your heart rate increase and getting agitated, then you can detect the symptoms as they occur and become aware of the stressful situation as it's occurring. Third, know what stress relief techniques work for you. Some people are big fans of mindfulness meditation. Those, and deep breathing exercises, are good for everyone to try.   For me, nothing beats stress relief like exercise. For me, what helps is exercising, in particular swimming. Aerobic exercise is associated with stress relief, and mixing it up with high-intensity regimens can help, too.   A lot of people have other specific techniques that help them. Some people clean their house, organize their closets or work in their gardens. Others spend time walking in nature, writing in a journal, knitting, playing with their pets or cycling.   I'd advise that you experiment with what works, take stock of existing techniques that help you and incorporate some of those practices into your regular routine. Then, in times of stress, they are good tools to turn to that you know will help you.    CNN: What unhealthy copings strategies should people avoid? Wen: Definitely. There are things people turn to in an effort to make themselves feel better in the short-term that can actually make things worse. Excessive alcohol intake, using drugs and smoking aren't healthy coping strategies. It's the same with staying up all night, binge-eating and taking out your frustration on loved ones. These have wide-ranging consequences, and you should reconsider them if they have been your go-to coping mechanisms in the past.   CNN: When is it time to seek help? Wen: If the stress you are feeling is consistently interfering with your work, social or personal life or if you are experiencing signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, it's time to seek help. Consider speaking with your primary care physician to get a referral to a therapist. Your workplace may have an Employee Assistance Program that you can turn to, too. And the federal mental health crisis hotline number, 988, is another resource.  This April, for Stress Awareness Month, I hope we can all assess our own stress levels as well as our reaction to stress. We should recognize what helps us to reduce and alleviate stress as we aim to improve our physical and emotional well-being.

                      FDA inspection finds sterilization issues at recalled eye drop manufacturer's facility
                  ","
                      The manufacturer of eye drops that have been linked to an outbreak of serious bacterial infections in the US, including at least three deaths, did not follow proper protocol to prevent contamination of its products, according to an inspection report published Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA visited a Global Pharma Healthcare facility in India for an inspection that started in mid-February, 2½ weeks after the company recalled EzriCare Artificial Tears due to possible contamination.  At the time of the recall, there were 55 reports of adverse events including eye infections, permanent loss of vision and at least one death with a bloodstream infection. As of late last month, 68 infections had been identified in 16 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been three deaths, eight cases of vision loss and four surgical eye removals reported. An 11-day inspection of the Global Pharma facility resulted in 11 observations by the FDA, including a ""manufacturing process that lacked assurance of product sterility,"" specifically for batches of product that were manufactured between December 2020 and April 2022 and shipped to the US. The EzriCare Artificial Tears product, which is manufactured by Global Pharma, is part of an outbreak of infections from bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa.   This rare drug-resistant bacteria can spread among people who don't have symptoms -- and to people who haven't used the eye drops, according to the CDC. This type of spread is particularly common in health care settings.  ""The bacteria can spread when one patient carrying the bacteria exposes another patient, or when patients touch common items or when healthcare workers transmit the germs which is why infection control, like hand hygiene, is so important,"" the agency told CNN in an email Monday. Several cases in the current outbreak have been identified in people who were carrying the bacteria without signs or symptoms of clinical infections, the CDC said. These cases were discovered through screenings at inpatient health care facilities that had clusters of infections. The particular strain of the bacteria associated with this outbreak had never before been reported in the US, and related infections have been identified at acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, emergency departments, urgent care clinics and other outpatient facilities. People affected by the outbreak reported using different brands of artificial tears, but EzriCare Artificial Tears was most commonly reported. The FDA inspection of the Global Pharma facility is part of an ongoing compliance matter. ""The FDA's highest priority is protecting public health -- this includes working with manufacturers to quickly remove unsafe drugs from shelves when they are identified,"" the agency said in an email Monday. ""The FDA continues to monitor this issue and is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the companies recalling these affected products. We urge consumers to stop using these products which may be harmful to their health.""

                      These 5 rules for good sleep may also impact development of asthma, experts say
                  ","
                      Bad sleep quality and quantity may put you at greater risk for developing asthma, according to a new study. Previous research has already shown that asthma tends to lead to sleep issues, but researchers wanted to know if the association worked the other way — that is, whether how someone slept impacted their likelihood of developing asthma, said the study, which published Monday in the journal BMJ Open Respiratory Research.  ""We've always known that there is some association between asthma and sleep but most of the work had been done on the presence of obstructive sleep apnea,"" said pediatric allergist Dr. Amal Assa'ad, associate director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. She was not involved in the latest study. To investigate, researchers looked at the data of a cohort from 2006 to 2010 with more than 450,000 people in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that is following residents long-term. The people studied ranged in age from 38 to 73 years old, the report said.  At a 10-year follow-up, nearly 18,000 people in the research were diagnosed with asthma, according to the study. Analysis of the data showed that people with both a genetic predisposition and poor sleep habits were twice as likely to develop asthma than people in a low-risk group. Typically, having a genetic predisposition puts you at a 25% to 30% greater risk of developing asthma, said Dr. Juanita Mora, a Chicago-based allergist/immunologist and national spokesperson for the American Lung Association. She was not involved in the research. There is good news: Healthy sleep patterns were shown to be associated with lower risk of asthma no matter the genetic susceptibility, the study said.  People with high-risk genes and good sleep patterns had slightly lower risk of developing asthma than people who had a low genetic risk and bad sleep patterns, the authors added.  By monitoring and treating sleep conditions, health professionals might also be mitigating the development of asthma, the study authors wrote. If sleep traits were improved, 19% of asthma cases could be prevented, according to the research.  This finding also points to a greater need for doctors and nurses to talk to their patients with asthma about their sleep habits to see if their behavior is worsening symptoms, Mora added.  Better sleep is good for everyone The key to understanding this study is understanding the interplay between genetics and behavior, Assa'ad said.  The researchers looked at all the small changes in DNA that can put someone at greater risk for developing asthma, she added. Those markers and the risk in the genetics become what's called a person's polygenic risk score. But most people don't know their genetic score for how susceptible they are to developing asthma and instead are only aware of how severe their symptoms are, Assa'ad said.  What people can do is track their trigger and exacerbating factors — of which sleep seems to be one of many — to get optimal control over their asthma, Mora said.  The results may underscore the importance of good sleep hygiene for everyone, regardless of their asthma genetics, she added. Inflammation may be behind why sleep is so important to managing or preventing asthma, according to the study.  Asthma is generally considered a chronic inflammatory disease, the study said. Previous research has shown that problems with sleep duration and insomnia are associated with chronic inflammation. Sleep disorders are also associated with chronic activation of the stress response, parts of which are key in the development of asthma, the study said.  Good sleep hygiene Adults need at least seven hours of sleep a night, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For many people, that isn't happening — 1 in 3 Americans have a sleep deficit, according to the CDC.  But it's not just quantity that you should focus on — quality matters, too.  ""Signs of poor sleep quality include not feeling rested even after getting enough sleep, repeatedly waking up during the night, and experiencing symptoms of sleep disorders (such as snoring or gasping for air),"" the CDC said.  That is where good sleep hygiene (or habits) come into play. The CDC recommends going to bed and waking up at the same time consistently, keeping the bedroom comfortable and dark, and avoiding electronics before bed.  A comfortable room typically means one that is cool — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius), according to a 2021 CNN story. A routine to get you ready for sleep isn't just for kids who need a bath and book before bed. Winding down with familiar activities is a great way to signal to brains of all ages that it is time to rest, pediatric sleep expert Ariel Williamson, a psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN earlier this year. You should also avoid large meals, caffeine and alcohol too close to bedtime and get active during the day for better sleep.  If none of those changes improves your sleep, it may be time to see a doctor, experts say.

                      Infertility affects a 'staggering' 1 in 6 people worldwide, WHO says
                  ","
                      An estimated 1 in 6 people globally are affected by infertility, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, which emphasizes that the condition is common. Rates of infertility -- defined as not being able to conceive after a year of having unprotected sex -- are similar across all countries and regions, Monday's WHO report says. ""In our analysis, the global prevalence of lifetime infertility was 17.5%, translating into 1 out of every 6 people experiencing it in their lifetime,"" Dr. Gitau Mburu, a scientist of fertility research at WHO, said Monday.  ""Lifetime prevalence of infertility does not differ by income classification of countries,"" he said. ""Lifetime prevalence was 17.8% in high-income countries and 16.5% in low- and middle-income countries, which, again, was not a substantial or significant difference."" Yet there are differences in how much people are spending on fertility treatments and how accessible such treatments are, according to the report. ""People in the poorest countries were found to spend a significantly larger proportion of their income on a single cycle of IVF or on fertility care compared with wealthier countries,"" Mburu said, ""exemplifying that this is an area with high-level risk of inequality in access to health care."" Global public health groups typically call attention to overpopulation as a major public health concern, so the spotlight that the WHO report turns on infertility not only is surprising but is welcome, said Dr. David Keefe, reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist at the NYU Langone Fertility Center in New York. ""That report did not surprise me in terms of the content, because it's been known for some time that infertility is much more prevalent than anyone wants to think about: Having a child and having a family is kind of a universal dream or aspiration for people from every country, from every region. What surprised me was the World Health Organization coming out in support of it,"" said Keefe, who was not involved with the WHO research. ""It was a welcome acknowledgment of the other foot dropping on the population front,"" he said. ""The acknowledgment that this is a worldwide problem and that additional attention must be devoted to it in terms of policy and strategy is welcome."" 'This is a worldwide problem' The WHO report -- described as the ""first of its kind in a decade"" -- includes an analysis of infertility data from 1990 through 2021. The data came from 133 previously published studies on infertility prevalence. ""The purpose of this analysis was to generate updated data on the global and regional estimates of infertility prevalence by analyzing all available data from different countries, making sure that we take into account different study approaches,"" Mburu said. Based on that data, the researchers estimate that lifetime prevalence of infertility -- representing the proportion of people who have ever experienced infertility in their reproductive life -- was 17.5% in 2022.  The period prevalence of infertility, meaning the proportion of people with infertility at any given point currently or in the past, was found to be 12.6% in 2022. Although the data showed some variation in infertility prevalence across regions -- with the highest lifetime prevalence at 23.2% in the Western Pacific, compared with the lowest at 10.7% in the Eastern Mediterranean -- those regional differences were not either substantial or conclusive based on the data, according to WHO's report.  The researchers also did not determine whether global infertility rates have been increasing or decreasing over time. ""The data which we analyzed for this report was from 1990 to 2021, and during that period, we did not see evidence of increasing rates of infertility. However, the way the data was arranged, it was not really organized to answer that question,"" Dr. James Kiarie, head of contraception and fertility care at WHO, said Monday. ""We cannot, based on the data we have, say that infertility is increasing or constant -- so we must say that probably the jury is still out on that question."" Over time, various factors can affect a person's fertility, and age is one of the most important, said Dr. Emre Seli, chief scientific officer for the maternal and infant health nonprofit March of Dimes. Seli, who is also a professor at Yale School of Medicine and medical director of Yale Fertility Center, was not involved in the new report.  ""Fertility decreases as the age of the female partner increases,"" he said. ""Fertility is really an emotionally taxing issue for those who are affected by it. It is a major source of stress to want to have a child and not be able to,"" Seli said. ""Most of my patients are women, and they do become affected by this at many levels, and they do suffer from lack of adequate research as well as lack of adequate insurance coverage to undergo the treatments that they need."" 'An important public health concern' Infertility, affecting the male or female reproductive system, can be treated with medicine, surgery or assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization or IVF, during which an egg and sperm are joined in a lab dish and put into a womb once the fertilized egg becomes an embryo.   ""Infertility is a major and a widespread health issue affecting a staggering 1 in 6 people globally over the duration of their reproductive lives,"" Dr. Pascale Allotey, director of the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department at WHO, said Monday. Despite that, solutions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility remain ""underfunded"" and ""inaccessible"" to many patients due to high costs, Allotey said. ""Infertility is an important public health concern because it can have wide-reaching negative impacts on the lives of the people affected,"" she said. ""WHO is calling for universal access to affordable high-quality fertility care, improved data to enable infertility to be meaningfully addressed in health policy and programs, and greater efforts to ensure this issue is no longer sidelined in health research and policy."" Mburu added that infertility can also have effects on mental health, raising risks of anxiety, depression and intimate partner violence. ""Our message is that infertility needs to be included as a priority in responding to the needs of populations in different countries,"" Mburu said. ""This is because people have a right to expect to obtain the highest possible standard of mental, social and physical health as defined by WHO."" The new data from WHO reinforces that more people need fertility coverage and access to high-quality care than was previously thought, said Dr. Asima Ahmad, an endocrinologist and fertility expert who serves as chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a company that helps employers set up fertility benefits. She added that inequities emerge in who has such access to care, such as Black women who tend to experience inequities in access. ""These inequities, I'm not surprised that they exist on a global level, because we already see the inequities in the United States domestically, with how infertility impacts different populations and how some populations have limited access. And even with the access that they finally get, they, for example, will have a lower rate of success or even a higher rate of miscarriage,"" said Ahmad, who was not involved in the new WHO report. ""A lot of people don't have access to clinically vetted evidence-based information around what causes infertility, how to recognize it, and then when you do find out that you have it, how to treat it,"" she said. ""The other, which is one of the biggest barriers that we see, is financial access to fertility. In the United States, a lot of that access comes through the employer providing, for example, fertility benefits, but on a global level, that's not necessarily the case, and finances tends to be the biggest barrier.""

                      Study finds slightly higher risk of autism diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed
                  ","
                      A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two. About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists still don't know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too. Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition. Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It's used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.  A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems. The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation. As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure. The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe. Experts say it's important to note that the research can't show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis. Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. ""Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,"" Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection. The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide. ""If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,"" wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. ""Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies -- which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water -- do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder. ""It's an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,"" said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. ""We have to see if there's a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD."" Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder. A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it's just the populations who live in more polluted areas. ""There's a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?"" Wiznitzer said. ""We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that's high on our list.""

                      How to make your community livable for you now and in the years ahead
                  ","
                      There is something exciting about a walk with my dog down my street — even though everything we see and do along the way is entirely predictable. I know we will wave hello to my retired neighbor tending his garden. We will pass teens at the basketball courts and younger kids on the playground. I know members of the church congregation are going to have their Saturday cookout. I know my dog Milo will start pulling when he sees the grocer at the end of the street and realizes a treat is coming any minute.  Predictable as they are, these environments and interactions that make up my neighborhood help make my community livable.  A livable community is one that is set up so that residents of any age can thrive, said Mike Watson, the director of livable communities at AARP. That way, a family can build a life with young children and then continue to feel invested in their community after retirement.  But those types of communities are not accessible to everyone everywhere, he added.  That is why the nonprofit Trust for America's Health and the AARP are working with communities all over the United States. The goal is to make them more ""safe and accessible and equitable to all racial ethnic groups and backgrounds,"" said Karon Phillips, policy development manager at the trust. Previous research has shown that social connections and community are key to a long life span and good health outcomes, while lack of social connections and unhappiness can reduce life expectancy. A livable community might be an important piece of living longer and better lives, Watson said.  What makes a livable community What makes a place livable depends on the needs of that particular neighborhood, but there are some common factors.  The four basic pillars of health are nutrition, physical activity, sleep and behavior (meaning stress, coping, connection and support), according to Johns Hopkins Children's Hospital. And many of the things needed in a livable community support those pillars. It's important that communities have various methods of transportation, Watson said. Safe roads are important, but so are navigable sidewalks and public transportation for residents who don't drive. Similarly, various forms of affordable housing help keep people living in the communities they love. In addition to single family homes, apartments and accessory dwelling units (an additional apartment or small home on the same lot as a single-family home) provide options for people with constraints or who need access to care from their loved ones, Phillips said.  Ways to access nutritious food and quality health care easily — with or without a car — also ensures that people can live well in their community, she added. And another critical factor is how effectively a place promotes social connection, Phillips said. Are there parks that various generations can frequent? Are there community centers or libraries? Are faith communities available? Are there systems or a culture in place so that people check up on one another?  Many resources are primarily available online, so high-speed internet broadband is also a resource that makes a neighborhood more accessible, Watson said. Though there may be retirement communities that aim to provide those needs to older residents, not everyone wants to leave their community when their needs change, he said.   ""What I've heard from my patients and what we see in terms of people's outcomes, the more that you can be integrated in the community where you live and work the better for your mood,"" said Dr. Mirnova Ceïde, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York.  ""People who are isolated or put into a different community, they can get really depressed,"" she added. How everyone benefits Whatever stage of life you are in, investing in a community that works for everyone is always a good idea, Phillips said.  If all goes well, today's 20-year-old will one day become a 60-year-old, so planning for a neighborhood that works long into the future benefits everyone, Watson said. ""Millennials are a larger generation and so are projected to live longer lives,"" he added. ""This country is aging."" But younger generations don't have to wait long to see the investment pay off, Watson said.  The same parks and libraries that bring social connection to older adults are also important resources for kids and young families, he said. A safe sidewalk and crosswalks are important for people using wheelchairs, people on crutches and families with strollers, too. And everyone has a lot to gain from living with multiple generations, whether that is learning about iPads or the roots of a community, said Dr. Joyce Balls-Berry, an associate professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""There's so much wealth that can be learned from our elders,"" Balls-Berry said. ""And there's even things that our seniors are learning from the generations that would be considered their grandchildren and great grandchildren."" How to make it happen Because many of the things that make communities livable rely on the built environment — such as parks, housing and grocery availability — much of the progress is going to have to come from local governments and organizations, Phillips said. ""Look at who needs to partner,"" Phillips said. ""There has to be a champion at the table that's going to push for this."" But that doesn't mean there is nothing you as an individual can do to invest in making your community more livable today, Watson said. In addition to pressing local government to make the changes you care about, you can do what other volunteer groups have had success doing: going around their neighborhoods and documenting parts that may be unsafe or inaccessible, he added. Pictures of cracks in sidewalks or curbs that might not be clear to someone with vision impairment can motivate lawmakers to distribute funding at levels that meet the community's needs, Watson said.  And the relationships you build in your community can make strides toward it being more livable, Ceïde said.  You don't have to assume your older neighbors are unable to do things on their own and just offer them your help. Ask your neighbors about themselves and their stories to form real connections, Ceïde added.  ""People like being able to engage with somebody at a human level, and letting them know that they are meaningful and they have something to provide can make a big difference in the quality of life of people,"" she said.

                      Laughter is therapy for the mind and body
                  ","
                      Amusement and pleasant surprises — and the laughter they can trigger — add texture to the fabric of daily life. Those giggles and guffaws can seem like just silly throwaways. But laughter, in response to funny events, actually takes a lot of work, because it activates many areas of the brain: ones that control motor, emotional, cognitive and social processing. As I found when writing ""An Introduction to the Psychology of Humor,"" researchers now appreciate laughter's power to enhance physical and mental well-being. Laughter's physical power People begin laughing in infancy, when it helps develop muscles and upper body strength. Laughter is not just breathing. It relies on complex combinations of facial muscles, often involving movement of the eyes, head and shoulders. Laughter — doing it or observing it — activates multiple regions of the brain: the motor cortex, which controls muscles; the frontal lobe, which helps you understand context; and the limbic system, which modulates positive emotions. Turning all these circuits on strengthens neural connections and helps a healthy brain coordinate its activity. By activating the neural pathways of emotions such as joy and mirth, laughter can improve your mood and make your physical and emotional response to stress less intense. For example, laughing may help control brain levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, similar to what antidepressants do. By minimizing your brain's responses to threats, it limits the release of neurotransmitters and hormones such as cortisol that can wear down your cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems over time. Laughter's kind of like an antidote to stress, which weakens these systems and increases vulnerability to diseases. READ MORE: Was that joke funny or offensive? Who's telling it matters Laughter's cognitive power A good sense of humor and the laughter that follows depend on an ample measure of social intelligence and working memory resources. Laughter, like humor, typically sparks from recognizing the incongruities or absurdities of a situation. You need to mentally resolve the surprising behavior or event — otherwise you won't laugh; you might just be confused instead. Inferring the intentions of others and taking their perspective can enhance the intensity of the laughter and amusement you feel. To ""get"" a joke or humorous situation, you need to be able to see the lighter side of things. You must believe that other possibilities besides the literal exist — think about being amused by comic strips with talking animals, such as those found in ""The Far Side."" READ MORE: Joy is good for your body and your mind — three ways to feel it more often  Laughter's social power Many cognitive and social skills work together to help you monitor when and why laughter occurs during conversations. You don't even need to hear a laugh to be able to laugh. Deaf signers punctuate their signed sentences with laughter, much like emoticons in written text. Laughter creates bonds and increases intimacy with others. Linguist Don Nilsen points out that chuckles and belly laughs seldom happen when alone, supporting their strong social role. Beginning early in life, infants' laughter is an external sign of pleasure that helps strengthen bonds with caregivers. Later, it's an external sign of sharing an appreciation of the situation. For example, public speakers and comedians try to get a laugh to make audiences feel psychologically closer to them, to create intimacy. By practicing a little laughter each day, you can enhance social skills that may not come naturally to you. When you laugh in response to humor, you share your feelings with others and learn from risks that your response will be accepted/shared/enjoyed by others and not be rejected/ignored/disliked. In studies, psychologists have found that men with Type A personality characteristics, including competitiveness and time urgency, tend to laugh more, while women with those traits laugh less. Both sexes laugh more with others than when alone. READ MORE: Lucky girl syndrome: the potential dark side of TikTok's extreme positive thinking trend Laughter's mental power Positive psychology researchers study how people can live meaningful lives and thrive. Laughter produces positive emotions that lead to this kind of flourishing. These feelings — such as amusement, happiness, mirth and joy — build resiliency and increase creative thinking. They increase subjective well-being and life satisfaction. Researchers find that these positive emotions experienced with humor and laughter correlate with appreciating the meaning of life and help older adults hold a benign view of difficulties they've faced over a lifetime. Laughter in response to amusement is a healthy coping mechanism. When you laugh, you take yourself or the situation less seriously and may feel empowered to problem-solve. For example, psychologists measured the frequency and intensity of 41 people's laughter over two weeks, along with their ratings of physical and mental stress. They found that the more laughter experienced, the lower the reported stress. Whether the instances of laughter were strong, medium or weak in intensity didn't matter. Maybe you want to grab some of these benefits for yourself — can you force laughter to work for you? A growing number of therapists advocate using humor and laughter to help clients build trust and improve work environments; a review of five different studies found that measures of well-being did increase after laughter interventions. Sometimes called homeplay instead of homework, these interventions take the form of daily humor activities — surrounding yourself with funny people, watching a comedy that makes you laugh or writing down three funny things that happened today. You can practice laughing even when alone. Intentionally take a perspective that appreciates the funny side of events. Laughing yoga is a technique of using breathing muscles to achieve the positive physical responses of natural laughing with forced laughter (ha ha hee hee ho ho). Researchers today certainly aren't laughing off its value, but a good deal of the research on laughter's influence on mental and physical health is based on self-report measures. More psychological experimentation around laughter or the contexts in which it occurs will likely support the importance of laughing throughout your day, and maybe even suggest more ways to intentionally harness its benefits.

                      Chronic stress can affect your health. One activity can help
                  ","
                      These days, many people find it hard to unplug. Inflation, global warming and gun violence are on the rise. Bullies proliferate on social media. The 24/7 news cycle constantly blares distressing news, and people often face difficult personal or professional situations.  About half of Americans said they experienced stress within the past day, according to a Gallup Poll survey from last October, a finding that was consistent for most of 2022. Personal finances and current and political events were major sources of stress for one-third or more of adults, a survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found in October.  Stress isn't inherently bad, said Richard Scrivener, a personal trainer and product development manager at London's Trainfitness, an education technology company. Stressing your muscles through weight training, for example, leads to beneficial changes. In addition, short-term stress in healthy people typically isn't a hazard. ""But if stress is continuous, especially in older or unhealthy individuals, the long-term effects of the response to stress may lead to significant health issues,"" Scrivener said. Can stress make you sick? Stress occurs when you face a new, unpredictable or threatening situation, and you don't know whether you can manage it successfully, said clinical psychologist Dr. Karmel Choi, an assistant professor in the Center for Precision Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  When you're physically or emotionally stressed, your body snaps into fight-or-flight mode. Cortisol rushes through your system, signaling your body to release glucose. Glucose, in turn, provides energy to your muscles so you are better prepared to fight off a threat or run away. During this cortisol rush, your heart rate may rise, your breathing may become rapid, and you may feel dizzy or nauseated.  If you truly needed to fight or flee a predator, your cortisol levels would drop back down once the conflict was over. When you're chronically stressed, however, those levels stay elevated.  Remaining in that heightened state is no good since high levels of cortisol can exacerbate health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic gastrointestinal problems, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Stress can also cause or contribute to anxiety, irritability, poor sleep, substance abuse, chronic distrust or worry, and more.  How to relieve stress Luckily, there are many ways to combat stress. Keep a daily routine, get plenty of sleep, eat healthy foods, and limit your time following the news or engaging in social media, recommends the World Health Organization. It also helps to stay connected with others and to employ calming practices such as meditation and deep breathing. One of the most successful tools, though, is physical activity. ""Exercise is remarkably effective for managing psychological stress,"" Choi said. ""Exercise doesn't remove what's causing the stress, but it can boost mood, reduce tension and improve sleep — all of which are impacted by stress — and ultimately this can support people to approach their challenges in a more balanced way.""  Numerous studies back up the positive effect of exercise on stress. Physical activity, and especially exercise, significantly reduced the symptoms of anxiety in a study published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, for example. Similarly, a Frontiers in Psychology study of university students found that regularly engaging in low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for six weeks helped alleviate their depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Get moving to release feel-good chemicals The reason exercise is so effective in squashing stress is fairly simple. Exercise causes your body to produce more endorphins, which are neurotransmitters that boost your mood. Movement also combats elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol while improving blood flow. Jessica Honig, a clinical social worker in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, said exercise empowers her clients because they realize that, through movement, they hold the key to reset and lessen their stress. ""It's also one of the best ways to pause — to break up or revive energy from a spiraling, unproductive mindset,"" she said. What types of exercise are best? While studies show aerobic exercise, such as swimming, running, dancing and boxing, may be the most efficient at getting mood-boosting endorphins rushing through your body, gentler forms of physical activity work, too. Think yoga, strength training and walking. In addition, sometimes less is more. ""What we're seeing from the data,"" Choi said, ""is you actually need to move less than the recommended guidelines to see positive effects on mood."" Since stress loads may change weekly or even daily, Scrivener said it can be helpful to alter your exercise based on your mood. Feeling a cheery 8 on a scale of 1 to 10? Then go for a run. Barely hitting a 3? Opt for something gentle. ""This could be a 15-minute stretch followed by a light cycle for 15 minutes, or a 30-minute swim followed by a sauna session,"" he said. Make exercise a social activity Since social engagement is a powerful protective factor for positive mental health, Choi encourages exercising with others. Studies also have shown being out in nature boosts your mood, so exercising outside with friends may provide even more benefits. Scientists continue to study the link between stress and physical activity. A small study published recently found that combining mindfulness and physical activity can improve sleep and help regulate emotions more than either alone, Choi said. She also warned that people need to be careful not to go overboard on exercise or rely on it exclusively for coping with challenges. Doing so can backfire and create more stress. It's also important to remember that humans are geared to release stress physically, no matter their age, said Honig, the social worker. ""We see in children the permission to throw their body into pillows to release intense emotions,"" she said. ""We do not outgrow a need to physically release stress. We merely lose the outlets and social normalization of it.""

                      Congress moves to make xylazine a controlled substance
                  ","
                      US lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine, the animal tranquilizer that's increasingly infiltrating illicit drugs, as a controlled substance.  Bipartisan legislation introduced Tuesday in the House and Senate reflects growing concern over the highly dangerous sedative, commonly known as ""tranq"" or ""tranq dope."" ""Drug traffickers are going to great lengths to pad their profits with dangerous drugs like tranq, and we need to empower law enforcement to crack down on its spread in our communities,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. ""This bipartisan legislation will ensure the DEA and local law enforcement have the tools they need to get xylazine off our streets while protecting its important use as a veterinary tranquilizer."" Xylazine has not been approved for human use. It has heavy sedative effects like an opioid but isn't one, so it doesn't respond to the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone, also known as Narcan. Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high. However, xylazine is associated with severe soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. The US Drug Enforcement Administration issued a public health alert this month noting that xylazine is widespread and has been detected in about 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pill seizures.  DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the alert that ""xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, fentanyl, even deadlier.""  Despite reports about the alarming rise of xylazine, also called a ""zombie drug,"" federal law enforcement has not had the tools to regulate it.  The proposed legislation would address this gap by making xylazine a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl.  The bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that it is not being diverted to the black market. ""Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H, a cosponsor of the bill, said in the statement. ""My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are seeing the impact of this deadly drug in their states, and we will continue working together to move this critical bill forward."" Xylazine is essential in veterinary medicine to sedate large animals like horses and cattle. Dr. Lori Teller, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said the group ""fully supports this congressional effort to combat illicit xylazine.""  ""We urge Congress to pass the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act quickly as it strikes the right balance of protecting our communities while preserving veterinary access to this critically important animal drug,"" Teller said.  However, Mary Sylla, director of overdose prevention policy and strategy at the National Harm Reduction Coalition, a national advocacy organization for people who use drugs, says the bill is a move in the wrong direction.  ""The position of the National Harm Reduction Coalition is that criminalization of drugs has never worked to reduce drug use or addiction. It's the opposite. Criminalization is the opposite of harm reduction,"" she said.  Sylla would rather to see more funding and support for evidence-based harm reduction, such as overdose prevention and syringe access programs. Harm reduction ""has evidence that it reduces drug use, it gets people engaged in treatment. It meets people where they are and allows them to make healthier choices about their substance use.""  The bill, which has been endorsed by the National Association of Police Organization and other law enforcement groups, is likely to disproportionately affect people on the lowest levels of the drug distribution chain and users themselves, says Maritza Perez, director of the Drug Policy Alliance's Office of Federal Affairs. ""Drug users are not seeking xylazine. It's often mixed into drugs that they're taking. So we have concerns that we'd be punishing drug users for a substance that they may not even know is found in their drug,"" she said. ""We would encourage lawmakers to instead fund and protect health services for people who use drugs, because that's really how we stop the harms of drug use. It's not by arresting people and throwing them behind bars."" Some states have taken matters into their own hands. Lawmakers in some states have taken steps to make xylazine a controlled substance, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order Wednesday to classify it as a Schedule III controlled substance. Lawmakers hope the bill will provide new tools to combat this deadly trend on a national level.   ""Drug overdoses remain unacceptably high as cartels and traffickers continue to flood our nation with deadly and ever-changing poison,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, another of the bill's sponsors, said in the statement. ""We cannot successfully prevent these tragedies with one hand tied behind our back.""

                      CDC investigates salmonella outbreak linked to flour
                  ","
                      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a salmonella outbreak that has been linked to flour, and it's urging people not to eat or play with uncooked dough or batter. A dozen illnesses -- including three hospitalizations -- have been reported in connection with the outbreak, spanning 11 states. However, the CDC says that the scale of the outbreak is probably much larger than the number of reported cases suggests. The agency has not identified specific brands of flour involved in the outbreak. Most of the patients whom the CDC has interviewed said they had eaten raw dough or batter in the week before falling ill, the timing of which spanned from December to mid-February. Flour was the only common ingredient in the raw dough or batter that was eaten. Most flour is raw and hasn't been treated to kill germs that cause food poisoning, according to the CDC. Salmonella bacteria dies when it is cooked or baked, but people can get sick when eating or tasting foods that include raw flour. Raw dough used for crafts and play clay also pose a risk. To stay safe, the CDC recommends following recipe or package instructions to fully cook cookies, cakes and other foods made with raw flour, and using warm water and soap to wash hands, utensils, countertops and anything else that comes into contact with raw four. People should also use heat-treated flour for homemade playdough. Symptoms of a salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover with treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don't improve after a few days or signs of dehydration.

                      Emergency room visits from firearms dropped in 2022, but remained higher than pre-pandemic rate
                  ","
                      Emergency department visits for firearm injuries in the United States dropped slightly since 2020, but the rate in 2022 was still above pre-pandemic levels.  According to a new study published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the weekly number of emergency department visits related to firearm injuries began to rise in March 2020 before sharply increasing in May 2020 and remaining high. The sharpest increase in visits happened the week of May 24, 2020, during a ""period of increased social unrest over strained law enforcement--community relations and longstanding systemic inequities, structural racism, and trauma experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States,"" the authors wrote in the study. On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was killed by three former Minneapolis police officers. The video of his death sparked nationwide uproar related to systemic racism and inequality.  In 2021, the rate dropped slightly from 2020. In 2022, the rate fell again, but still sat above the rate of weekly emergency department visits related to firearm injuries in 2019, prior to the pandemic.  Compared to the rate of visits in 2019, 2020 was 37% higher than the previous year, 2021 was 36% higher than 2019, and 2022 was 20% higher than that year.  In 2019, the average weekly number of visits was about 979, according to the study.  In 2022, the average number of weekly visits reached 1,170.  Of those 1,170 visits, roughly 180 of them were for women and about 990 were for men.  In general, most visitors between 2019 and 2022 were 15 to 24 years of age, but there was a sharp increase in infant to 14-year-olds going to the emergency department for firearm injuries.  In 2019, on average, about 29 of the 979 people who visited an emergency department for firearm related injuries were ages 0 to 14.  In 2022, on average, infants to 14-year-olds made up about 40 of the 1,170 weekly visits.  The authors offered some background for why there was an increase in visits among children.  ""Challenges faced by children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic might have influenced their risk for firearm injury, including disruptions to daily routines and schooling,"" the authors of the study wrote.  Social isolation, physical distancing, increased time at home, changes in healthcare access, and diminished security and safety could have increased access to firearms in the home for children.  The bigger picture During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rate of firearm homicides increased by 35%, and in 2020 the rate was the highest on record since 1993, according to the study.  In 2021, the rate of firearm suicide was the highest on record since 1990. According to previous CDC data, during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, US counties with the highest poverty level had firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates that were 4.5 and 1.3 times as high, respectively, as counties with the lowest poverty level. That same year 79% of all homicides and 53% of all suicides in the US involved firearms, according to the CDC.  What can be done? More research is needed to better understand the overall causes for the increase in emergency department visits for firearm injuries, the study said.  The study said this data should be used to create a comprehensive approach to prevent and respond to firearm injuries, and to address the social and economic inequalities that contribute to an increased risk of violence.  These strategies should be community based, according to the study, and might include street outreach programs and conflict de-escalation tools.  The study authors also suggested implementing hospital-based programs that intervene with victims of violence and improving community physical environment through vacant lot remediation.  Outside of community initiatives, the authors say enhanced secure firearm storage could reduce firearm access to people who could hurt themselves or others.

                      First on CNN: CDC team studying health impacts of Ohio train derailment fell ill during investigation
                  ","
                      Seven US government investigators briefly fell ill in early March while studying the possible health impacts of a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to CNN on Thursday.   The investigators' symptoms included sore throats, headaches, coughing and nausea -- consistent with what some residents experienced after the February 3 train derailment that released a cocktail of hazardous chemicals into the air, water and soil.     The investigators who experienced symptoms were part of a team conducting a house-to-house survey in an area near the derailment, and they immediately reported their symptoms to federal safety officers.  ""Symptoms resolved for most team members later the same afternoon, and everyone resumed work on survey data collection within 24 hours. Impacted team members have not reported ongoing health effects,"" a CDC spokesperson said in the statement.  The illnesses are coming to light after repeated assurances by government officials and representatives from Norfolk Southern, the company that operated the train, that the air and drinking water in East Palestine is not hazardous to health.    It is not clear what caused the investigators' symptoms -- whether chemical exposure or something else, such as fatigue. But the team, some of whom are officers and physicians in the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, found it suspicious that they became ill at the same time and with the same symptoms, according to an official familiar with the cases who spoke to CNN.   The official asked to not be identified because they are not authorized to share details of the incident; a CDC spokesperson confirmed information in the official's account, including the date, the number of people involved and the symptoms they experienced.      Because the investigators' symptoms improved soon after they left the area, the incident was not reported to the public, the official said, noting that reports of illnesses experienced by CDC personnel on the job wouldn't ordinarily be disclosed.  Still, experts in chemical exposures say the episode is significant.  ""It adds confirmation that the symptoms reported by East Palestine residents are real and are associated with environmental exposures from the derailment and chemical fire,"" said David Michaels, an epidemiologist and professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health who ran the Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 2009 and 2017. He has not been involved in the investigation in East Palestine.  In a separate case in February, two contractors who were working for the US Environmental Protection Agency reported symptoms related to strong odors and reported them to the site safety officer. The safety officer advised the contractors to step away from the area where they were working and monitor their symptoms, according to a statement sent to CNN by an EPA spokesperson. Their symptoms eased, and they returned to work at the site the same day.  No other incidents have been reported by more than 100 EPA personnel deployed to the site, the statement said.  CNN asked the EPA where the contractors were working and what they were doing when they experienced these symptoms, but the EPA did not respond by deadline.    A spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency says its safety officer didn't receive any reports of staff experiencing symptoms while working in the area.  Andrew Whelton, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Purdue University who has been traveling to East Palestine to conduct independent testing for the town, says he hopes the government agencies will continue to be forthcoming about the experiences of their staff and contractors in the area.  ""I think it is important for not only government officials to communicate with each other, but also to communicate their experiences with the public, so that everybody can understand what's going on, and how help needs to be brought to East Palestine and the surrounding areas,"" Whelton told CNN.  Team experienced symptoms they were investigating  The cause of the February 3 crash is still under investigation, but preliminary reports suggest that a wheel bearing on the train overheated, caught fire and failed -- sending 11 cars carrying more than a million pounds of hazardous chemicals off the tracks.  Chemicals spilled into the soil and air and into two small creeks that run through the town. A car carrying flammable vinyl chloride became unstable, sparking fears of a massive explosion. Nearby residents were evacuated while small holes were punched in the railcars so the vinyl chloride could be channeled into a trench where it was burned. A black mushroom cloud rose over the town and left ash and soot on cars and buildings for miles around.   Since February 8, when the burning railcars were finally extinguished, state and federal officials have consistently told East Palestine residents that they have not detected any chemicals linked to the derailment in air or drinking water at levels that would threaten human health.  Yet people living in East Palestine and the surrounding area have continued to share stories about unexplained symptoms including headaches, sore throats, nasal congestion, bloody noses, skin rashes, coughs and eye irritation.  The government team that experienced symptoms is from the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, or ATSDR, a branch that assesses the health impacts of chemical exposures. After the train derailment, ATSDR sent 15 people to East Palestine to conduct an Assessment of Chemical Exposure, known as an ACE investigation.  They often worked 18-hour days, going door-to-door to ask residents a detailed set of questions about where they spent their time in the days after the spill and what symptoms they or their pets may have experienced.  They worked in small groups of two and three to visit houses in the areas that they expected to be the most affected by the chemicals based on their proximity to the spill and two area creeks, Leslie Run and Sulphur Run, which have been heavily contaminated. They also surveyed parts of nearby Beaver County, Pennsylvania, which was downwind of the spill on the night of the derailment and the controlled burn of five tankers of vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make PVC pipe.   It's not clear what area the team members were in when they began to feel ill.  The CDC spokesperson said the other eight members of the team did not experience symptoms.  The official who was familiar with the cases said team members reported their illnesses to the EPA's on-site safety officer, who advised them to return to their hotel in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles from East Palestine, and to the CDC's Office of Safety, Security and Asset Management, or OSSAM, the agency's workplace safety office. OSSAM agreed with the EPA assessment that team members should return to their hotel that night, March 6. The team then worked from their hotel on March 7, according to the official.  The CDC acknowledged the incident to CNN after posts began circulating on social media saying the team was sent home because they got sick; the official said that wasn't the case.  Members of the team began to rotate out of the area as they finished their work. Most of the  team members left March 10, and the last member left March 16, according to the official.  Early results of the Ohio ACE survey show that more than half of the 514 residents who have taken it so far have experienced symptoms after the derailment. The top symptoms reported by residents in the area are headaches, reported by 74% of people taking the survey; anxiety (61%); coughing (53%); fatigue (53%); pain, irritation or burning of the skin (50%); and stuffy nose/sinus congestion (50%), according to the Ohio Department of Health. The questions on the survey ask about a ""burning nose or throat"" but didn't specifically mention sore throats or nausea.    The surveys can't prove that residents were exposed to harmful levels of chemicals or that those chemicals caused their symptoms. They are meant to be a snapshot, documenting the health of the community after an event that results in potentially hazardous exposures.  The ATSDR team reports the results of the surveys back to the state departments of health and may make recommendations based on the findings. The team is doing a total of three reports: one for Ohio, one for residents in Pennsylvania and a third on the first responders to the derailment.  Preliminary results are expected to be shared with the states in early April, with final reports released to the public within a few months.  As of March 28, ATSDR had conducted 1,002 ACE surveys: 686 for area residents and 316 for derailment responders, the CDC spokesperson said in an email to CNN.  Cleanup continues   The EPA continues real-time air monitoring in East Palestine using a specially equipped bus that samples and tests the air. To date, the agency reports that the cleanup has removed an estimated 11,961 tons of contaminated soil and 9.2 million gallons of liquid wastewater.  It has also tested the indoor air of 624 area homes and sampled the soil at 115 properties in the area.  The agency said this week that early results of its dioxin testing have not shown any levels above expected background levels, although it didn't release any of the test results, which are still going through quality checks.  Testing conducted by the Ohio EPA shows that two creeks that run through East Palestine are still testing positive for chemicals released by the spill. The state is using aerators to increase oxygen in the water to speed the breakdown of those chemicals.  The testing shows that the chemical levels in the streams are dropping over time, but some chemicals spilled from the train are still being detected almost two months after the derailment. On a recent visit to the area, EPA Administrator Michael Regan said children and adults should not go near the creeks.  ""As a father, I would not advise anybody -- adult or child -- play in the creeks or stream. What we've said is the drinking water has been tested"" and found to be safe, Regan said at a news conference in East Palestine on March 1.  At a hearing this month, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw was asked whether he would live in East Palestine, given what he knows about the derailment.  ""Yes, sir,"" Shaw responded in testimony before the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee on March 9. ""I believe that the air is safe. I believe that the water is safe. There are hundreds of tests, there are millions of data points, and they all point to the same thing.""  To residents, the official assurances that everything is fine sound hollow.  ""They're all scientists. They're sitting up here telling us nothing's wrong. I want you to tell

                      WHO advisers to consider whether obesity medication should be added to Essential Medicines List
                  ","
                      Advisers to the World Health Organization will consider next month whether to add liraglutide, the active ingredient in certain diabetes and obesity medications, to its list of essential medicines. The list, which is updated every two years, includes medicines ""that satisfy the priority health needs of the population,"" WHO says. ""They are intended to be available within the context of function health systems at all times, in adequate amounts in the appropriate dosage forms, of assured quality and at prices that individuals and the community can afford.""   The list is ""a guide for the development and updating of national and institutional essential medicine lists to support the procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector, medicines reimbursement schemes, medicine donations, and local medicine production."" The WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines is scheduled to meet April 24-28 to discuss revisions and updates involving dozens of medications. The request to add GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide came from four researchers at US institutions including Yale University and Brigham and Women's Hospital. These drugs mimic the effects of an appetite-regulating hormone, GLP-1, and stimulate the release of insulin. This helps lower blood sugar and slows the passage of food through the gut. Liraglutide was developed to treat diabetes but approved in the US as a weight-loss treatment in 2014; its more potent cousin, semaglutide, has been approved for diabetes since 2017 and as an obesity treatment in 2021. The latter use has become well-known thanks to promotions from celebrities and on social media. It's sold under the name Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.  Studies suggest that semaglutide may help people lose an average of 10% to 15% of their starting weight -- significantly more than with other medications. But because of this high demand, some versions of the medication have been in shortage in the US since the middle of last year.  The US patent on liraglutide is set to expire this year, and drugmaker Novo Nordisk says generic versions could be available in June 2024. The company has not been involved in the application to WHO, it said in a statement, but ""we welcome the WHO review and look forward to the readout and decision."" ""At present, there are no medications included in the [Essential Medicines List] that specifically target weight loss for the global burden of obesity,"" the researchers wrote in their request to WHO. ""At this time, the EML includes mineral supplements for nutritional deficiencies yet it is also described that most of the population live in 'countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.' "" WHO's advisers will make recommendations on which drugs should be included in this year's list, expected to come in September. ""This particular drug has a certain history, but the use of it probably has not been long enough to be able to see it on the Essential Medicines List,"" Dr. Francesco Blanca, WHO director for nutrition and food safety, said at a briefing Wednesday. ""There's also issues related to the cost of the treatment. At the same time, WHO is looking at the use of drugs to reduce weight excess in the context of a systematic review for guidelines for children and adolescents. So we believe that it is a work in progress, but we'll see what the Essential Medicines List committee is going to conclude.""

                      Mysterious hepatitis outbreak in kids in 2022 linked to common childhood respiratory virus, studies suggest
                  ","
                      An outbreak of acute severe, unexplained hepatitis in previously healthy children in 2022 may be linked to adeno-associated virus 2, or AAV2, according to three independent studies published Thursday in the journal Nature.  Between April and July 2022, more than 1,000 children worldwide -- at least 350 of them in the United States -- were diagnosed with hepatitis, a disease involving liver inflammation, with no known cause. Nearly 50 needed liver transplants, and 22 children died, according to the World Health Organization.  New research suggests that AAV2 might be implicated in the disease. This common childhood virus cannot copy itself unless in the presence of another ""helper"" virus, such as adenovirus or herpesvirus. AAV2 was present among nearly all of the children with unexplained acute hepatitis, and many were infected with multiple helper viruses, the researchers found.  Although the researchers can't say for sure, the timing of the outbreak may have been associated with the global loosening of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions after periods of relative isolation. ""Children were suddenly exposed to a barrage of viruses after lockdowns or had poorly trained immune systems that led to an increased susceptibility to otherwise harmless viruses,"" Dr. Frank Tacke, a gastroenterologist from Germany who was not involved with the research, wrote in an editorial published alongside the new studies.  Consistent link among studies  One of the new studies, which analyzed tissue samples from children in the United States, detected AAV2 in 93% of 14 cases but only 4% of 113 controls. The researchers found that all children infected with AAV2 had co-infection with a ""helper"" virus -- either human herpesvirus 6 or Epstein-Barr virus -- that might promote AAV2 replication.  ""Our results suggest that co-infection with AAV2 may cause more severe liver disease than infection by an adenovirus or herpesvirus alone,"" the authors wrote.  A second study, which took place in the United Kingdom, reported high levels of AAV2 in 96% of 28 affected children and only low levels in a control group. Low levels of human adenovirus and human herpesvirus 6 were found in the liver in most cases, which the authors similarly speculate enabled AAV2 replication and liver damage. A third study suggests that abnormal immune response might promote AAV2 liver damage. Researchers in the United Kingdom found high levels of AAV2 in blood and liver samples of 81% of 32 affected children and detected only low AAV2 levels in 7% of 74 unaffected children. Among the affected group, 93% carried a genetic mutation that predisposes a person to autoimmune diseases involving T cells, a type of immune cell.  Further research needed Scientists previously believed that human adenovirus, which typically causes mild cold- or flu-like illness, may have been responsible for the outbreak. However, adenovirus usually affects only people with very weak immune systems, and various strains indicated that a single viral strain could not explain the outbreak, which cast doubt on this hypothesis. The new findings are ""likely to spark debate, and could influence disease management,"" Tacke said.  Uncovering the mechanism will be important for treatment. If AAV2 is responsible, antivirals would be appropriate. If it is due an unusual immune response, drugs that weaken the immune system might be necessary.  Although the consistent findings across two continents provide strong evidence, several uncertainties remain, including whether AAV2 directly causes liver damage or is ""just a bystander."" For example, because they can't replicate on their own, adeno-associated viruses are commonly used as vehicles for gene therapy. Although liver damage has been observed in trials that involve AAV-based approaches, it is rare and generally not fatal, scientists say.  ""If AAV2 directly caused hepatitis, one would expect more cases to have been reported,"" Tacke said.  More studies are needed to understand how AAV2 infection alone, or with another virus, might affect liver cells, he recommended. ""Until then, surveillance for AAV2 (and related viruses) in such cases is to be advised,"" he said.

                      Prescriptions for ADHD treatments surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC report shows
                  ","
                      Prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults, a new study found. The finding comes as one common ADHD treatment, Adderall, has been in shortage for months, in part because of high demand. Diagnoses for ADHD have become more common in recent decades, and prescriptions for stimulant drugs that are most often used to treat the neurodevelopmental disorder have also been on the rise. But the new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights a recent surge in demand for the drug and others like it. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. Overall, the CDC analysis of private insurance records shows that more than 4% of people ages 5 to 64 had filled a prescription for a stimulant in 2021, up from 3.8% in 2020. The vast majority of people who are prescribed stimulant medications have an ADHD diagnosis or are being treated for symptoms of the disorder.   ADHD is typically identified in childhood and has been more prevalent among boys, and the CDC analysis found that stimulant prescriptions were consistently most common among boys ages 5 to 19.  However, the largest annual increases in 2021 were among adults, especially women in their 20s and 30s. There are well-established clinical guidelines for ADHD care for children and adolescents, with an outline of symptoms that show a persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity. While there is growing recognition of ADHD in adults, a comparable playbook for adults does not exist. The gap in guidance for adults is a public health concern in part because of the ""general inadequate access to mental health providers trained to diagnose and manage ADHD,"" according to the researchers. ""Development of clinical recommendations for diagnosing and managing adult ADHD could help guide safe and appropriate stimulant prescribing,"" they wrote. While stimulants can offer ""substantial benefits"" for people with ADHD, there are also potential harms including misuse and overdose. Nearly 33,000 people died from an overdose involving a psychostimulant in 2021, CDC data shows. Methamphetamine is primary drug involved, but deaths have nearly doubled since 2019. The sharp rise in prescriptions for stimulants during the pandemic also raises questions about the role of telehealth. Expanded access to telehealth during the pandemic could have removed barriers and encouraged more people to seek care, especially during a time when mental health struggles were exacerbated.  But it also could have introduced greater potential for inadequate evaluations or inappropriate stimulant prescribing, according to the researchers. ""Evaluation of policies enacted during the pandemic could identify benefits and harms of those policies,"" they wrote. Some people who use stimulants for ADHD have struggled for months to fill their prescriptions.  The US Food and Drug Administration announced a shortage of Adderall on October 12, 2022. The agency noted that it was in communication with all manufacturers of amphetamine mixed salts and that one of those companies was ""experiencing ongoing intermittent manufacturing delays."" Although other manufacturers continued to produce the drug, the agency said, ""there is not sufficient supply to continue to meet U.S. market demand through those producers."" Jim McKinney, a spokesperson for the agency, told CNN last month that the manufacturing delay has been resolved and that the shortage is now ""demand-driven."" On its website, the FDA lists eight manufacturers that have reported Adderall shortages to the agency. The website lists the shortage reason for some versions of the drug, such as ""demand increase"" or ""shortage of active ingredient,"" but for other versions, it just says ""other"" or lists no reason at all.

                      More symptoms than you think may be tied to your migraines
                  ","
                      Contrary to what internalized stigma may tell you, a migraine isn't just a headache. In people younger than age 50, chronic migraines are the leading cause of disability, according to a 2018 study. But many people who live with the condition can have a hard time recognizing its seriousness and getting the medical care they need for their migraines, said Kylie Petrarca, a nurse and associate program director of the Association of Migraine Disorders. ""People don't give it the recognition it deserves,"" she added. Many doctors don't know enough about the nuances of migraine disorders, said Dr. Frederick Godley, an ear, nose and throat specialist and president of the Association of Migraine Disorders.  But there are professionals researching and treating migraine conditions. A new study that was published Wednesday in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology, has shown that both cluster headaches and migraines have a connection to circadian systems, meaning time of day and sleep patterns might have a big impact on those conditions. Understanding what migraines are, why you may get them and what you can do is a powerful tool to advocate for yourself and get the proper treatment, Petrarca said.  What are migraines? What used to be called a migraine headache is now called a migraine attack to better capture how much further the condition extends beyond pain in the head, Petrarca said.  Migraines start deep in the brain, said Dr. Stewart Tepper, a neurologist based in Lebanon, New Hampshire. The condition is better understood as a complex neurological disease that affects many parts of the nervous system, Godley said.   To be diagnosed with a migraine condition, a patient has to have at least five attacks in their lifetime that each last four to 72 hours when left untreated. The condition must also meet at least two of four criteria: moderate to severe intensity, throbbing pain, worsening with activity, and occurrence on one side of the head, Tepper said. The attacks also must have at least one of two features: nausea and sensitivity to light or sound, he added. Where do migraines come from? It's hard to say exactly, but there is a lot of evidence to show there are genetic and environmental factors that lead to people getting migraines, Petrarca said. Migraines tend to be passed down in families, but can still present differently among various family members, Godley said.  Although genetics are a major cause, some migraines can also be caused by head injuries, he added. And hormonal changes, particularly in estrogen, can really impact migraine attacks. It is important to note, however, that there is a difference between what causes someone to be prone to migraines and what triggers them, Tepper said.  What are the triggers? Migraine triggers are different for everyone, so Petrarca recommends keeping a diary of when you get attacks so you can track what factors might correlate. People usually start to get their migraines after puberty, but they can show up in younger children in forms like colic, motion sickness and dizziness, Godley said.  For many women, migraine attacks tend to go along with phases of the menstrual cycle as estrogen levels change, Petrarca said. But they can also be triggered by weather changes, stress, sleep disturbances, skipping meals, dehydration and alcohol, she added.  Unfortunately, both chocolate and wine can be a big trigger, Petrarca said. But each person who suffers migraines will have their own triggers.  What are the symptoms?  When people think of migraines, they often think of head pain. But a lot of people experience many more symptoms than that.  About a third of people will experience an aura leading up to their migraine, which is ""a temporary perceptual disturbance that lasts from five minutes to an hour,"" Petrarca said. That can look like blurred vision, seeing spots, numbness in the extremities or changes in speech, she added.  The list of possible symptoms that go along with a migraine is long but includes: dizziness, vertigo, brain fog, tinnitus, mood changes, yawning, neck pain and food craving, Petrarca said.  ""I think kind of taking it away from just the head pain, you know there's many, many other symptoms that also go along with a migraine attack,"" she said.  And some of the symptoms, including exhaustion, can happen before a migraine, after it or in between attacks, Tepper added. What can you do about them? There are many medications you can discuss with your doctor to treat migraine attacks or prevent them from happening, but it is important to find a doctor who understands migraine conditions, Godley said.  Because medical professionals who are well versed in treating migraines are in short supply, you may need to advocate for yourself and your pain to get a diagnosis and effective treatment, Petrarca said.  When you get those medications, have them ready and try to take them as soon as you start having symptoms rather than waiting until later, she added. ""It's very hard to kind of stop it once it's started,"" she said.  But medication isn't the only way to address migraine disorders. One of the first things a person can do is make modifications to their lifestyle, Petrarca said.  Cognitive behavioral therapy is often useful to help manage the stress that can trigger migraine attacks, and taking vitamins and supplements, such as magnesium and riboflavin, can be effective in reducing migraine frequency, she said. But getting down to the basics of health can be extremely helpful — track your migraines, create a sleep routine, exercise regularly, eat well-balanced meals, manage stress and stay hydrated, Petrarca said.

                      Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The damage to the human body caused by firearms
                  ","
                      One of the most memorable lectures during my first year of medical school at the University of Michigan was delivered by Dr. Julian ""Buz"" Hoff. He was the chair of neurosurgery and a master at teaching the natural history of brain diseases. We learned about brain tumors, vascular diseases and trauma.  Hoff had a way of explaining things that made them really stick, and that was particularly clear in his lecture called ""GSW."" Anyone who works in a hospital probably knows that the acronym GSW stands for ""gunshot wound,"" and the way Hoff wanted us to learn the topic was for us see the impact firsthand. So on the last day of his class, we went to an outdoor gun range in Ann Arbor for our GSW lecture. There were handguns there, as well as rifles. In the distance, I saw several watermelons on top of old barrels that would serve as targets. After putting in his ear plugs and donning safety glasses, Hoff shot a watermelon with a handgun. I saw the bullet hit the watermelon but wasn't confident I saw the bullet exit. The watermelon was then brought to us for inspection.  First thing to notice, he told us: There was an obvious entrance and exit ""wound,"" and they were around the same size. We could see the green skin folding in on itself around the entrance wound and the outward beveled tissue around the exit. After we chopped the watermelon open, he pointed out that the bullet seemed to have traveled in a fairly predictable trajectory, a linear bullet-sized line through the body of the watermelon. Next came the same demonstration with a rifle. This time, I saw the watermelon shudder as it was struck and then immediately saw a significant amount of red tissue fly out the backside. Upon inspection, the first thing I noticed was how much bigger the exit wound was, compared with the entrance. And after opening the watermelon, the purpose of the demonstration became clear: Instead of a predictable linear track, the watermelon looked like it had been cored out and what was left was shredded. He explained that this was a phenomenon known as cavitation, which is just what it sounds like: The bullet doesn't simply travel through the body, it creates a big cavity inside it.  The message was clear: I want you to imagine that had been a human body.  Much in the way pictures of black lungs had left an indelible impression of smoking on all medical students, Hoff had done the same with me for GSWs. I was reflecting on that demonstration recently when I operated on a patient with a GSW to the head. It was a handgun injury, and we were able to quickly control the bleeding and relieve the pressure on the brain. The patient spent one day in the ICU for observation and was discharged a few days later. Had it been a rifle injury, there was hardly any chance he would've survived.  With guns front and center yet again with the recent shooting in Nashville, I wanted to share what I have learned over the years about what bullets do to the human body and the challenge it is for surgeons to repair the damage. More damage Nearly 30 years after my med school gun range demonstration, Dr. Ernest E. Moore, trauma surgeon and director of trauma research at the Shock Trauma Center named after him at Denver Health, is also using the watermelon example to draw a comparison between different firearms.  ""I often use the analogy that the injury to the liver [with a semi-automatic rifle] would be similar to just taking a watermelon and dropping it on the cement. It's incredible the amount of energy delivered. ... By comparison, the 9 millimeter would drill a hole through the liver. So you'd have a sizable hole, but if you didn't hit a major blood vessel, it's a pretty tolerable injury. In fact, we in civilian trauma will often manage a 9-millimeter liver injury without an operation, whereas a patient with an assault rifle would be dead within 20 minutes if you didn't operate,"" he said. Other human tissue in the body reacts differently. ""If you struck a bone with an AR-15, like your femur in your leg, it would literally shatter into multiple fragments that would sort of serve as secondary missiles. Whereas ... we've seen 9 millimeters that will actually drill a hole right to the femur,"" he said. (An AR-15 is a lightweight semi-automatic -- that is, self-loading -- rifle manufactured by Colt; other gunmakers make rifles in a similar style.)  Moore also brings up cavitation as a way of visualizing what is happening in the body. He describes cavitation ""as the result of a rapid expansion of the tissues surrounding the path of the bullet. ... In essence, instead of a virtual drill hole with a 9 millimeter, your path of injury in tissue with an AR-15 will be 6 inches wide. And the path beyond that is even wider, but the tissue recoils back into it,"" said Moore, noting that inelastic tissue -- like the liver, heart and brain -- are the most vulnerable to this type of energy. A brief history of the AR-15-style weapon Although the Department of Justice noted last year that 77.2% of mass shootings -- which it counts as four or more deaths, excluding the shooter -- involve handguns, many of the highest-profile incidents involved assault-style rifles: the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; Orlando's Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016; the 2017 shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas; and the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida; the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, and the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, just to name a few.  This kind of rifle unleashes a lot of power, said Moore, who, in addition to being a trauma surgeon since 1976 (who operated on some of the Columbine survivors), co-edited a major textbook on trauma surgery, authored more than 1,700 scientific articles and was the longtime editor of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. ""The capacity for tissue injury is reflected in the so-called kinetic energy. And the kinetic energy, simplistically, is the mass or weight of the bullet times the velocity squared. So the velocity -- the speed of the bullet exiting the gun -- is really its primary effectiveness,"" he said. Moore said a 9-millimeter handgun has a muzzle energy -- the kinetic energy of a bullet as it leaves the gun's muzzle -- of roughly 400 foot-pounds of force. For a rifle like the AR-15, that number is 1,300. ""So you have a huge increase in the amount of energy imparted from the gun,"" he explained. He said the size of the bullet has less to do with the damage it causes. ""I think there are some misconceptions with ... rifles. A lot of people say, 'Oh, they're big bullets.' Actually, they're small bullets -- interestingly, they're even smaller than many handguns. So the actual bullet that's discharged from an AR-15, for example, is a half the size of the bullet from a 9 millimeter. The difference is the ... velocity,"" he said.  And, if that rifle is a semi-automatic weapon, the weapon can be fired repeatedly, without manually reloading, simply by pulling the trigger. In Uvalde, hundreds of rounds were fired into classrooms in the first four minutes, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw.  Moore, who grew up in a hunting family, owns firearms and is an avid hunter, has been outspoken in his opposition to civilians owning AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons and does not own one himself.  ""The rifle that our military uses to fight our enemies is the same rifle that we allow civilians access to and can create these mass shootings,"" he said.   An Emmett Till moment During my neurosurgery training and the first several years of my career, I didn't encounter these sorts of injuries. That's because between 1994 and 2004, certain semi-automatic firearms were banned. In fact, it was in 2003, while I was covering the war in Iraq, that I first saw the damage these weapons cause on the human body, not just a watermelon.  I was embedded with the Devil Docs, the Navy medical team that provides front-line medical care for the Marines. There are things that my cameraman Mark Biello and I saw on the battlefield that we still have a hard time talking about. They are still hard to even write about. Limbs blown clean off the body and wounds so horrific, I thought for sure they must've been caused by a bomb or IED.  I never imagined that just a couple of years later, I would see the same sorts of injuries in US cities, including my own, Atlanta. Those are the days when I come home from the hospital simply unable to talk, let alone describe what I had just witnessed.  Still, as you may have read after the tragedy in Uvalde last year, some folks raised whether we should have an ""Emmett Till moment.""  Emmett Till was a 14-year-old Black teen who was abducted and violently murdered in 1955 by white racists in Mississippi after a white woman accused him of whistling at her. Till's mother took the unusual step of holding an open-casket funeral and allowing a photographer from Jet magazine to photograph her son's disfigured, unrecognizable face to show the country the result of racial violence. Many consider that moment a turning point in the country's collective support for the civil rights movement. Many of my colleagues have urged me to further describe the horrific injuries I have seen over the last nearly 20 years as a neurotrauma surgeon.  The truth is, I'm not sure America is ready to see that. More important, it isn't a decision anybody can make unless it's their loss and their story to tell -- like Emmett Till's mother. Public health emergency Louis Klarevas, research professor at Columbia University and author of the 2016 book ""Rampage Nation,"" credits the 10-year federal assault weapons ban between 1994 and 2004 with significantly reducing the number of mass shooting incidents and deaths (which he defined as injuring or killing six or more people) before rebounding to even higher levels after the ban expired. In 2020, there were an estimated 20 million AR-15 style weapons in circulation in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Between 1990 and 1999, during the decade in which I traveled to that gun range with Hoff, mass shootings claimed an average of 21 lives per year; from 2012 to 2021, that average had gone up to 51, according to the Violence Project. It defines a mass shooting as four or more people in a public place being killed with firearms, without any underlying criminal activity, excluding the shooter. (CNN defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people other than the shooter are injured or killed by gunfire during one event.)  Federal data on the overall impact of gun violence is lacking. Even obtaining the basic numbers can be a challenge, as I learned writing this article. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dashboards for Covid-19 and mpox, gun violence

Researchers discovered that positive social experiences impact not only a person's stress level and ability to cope, but also markers of physical health, according to a study published Monday in the journal Society for Personality and Social Psychology. The study followed more than 4,000 people over three weeks as they completed check-ins every three days on their smartphones or smartwatches regarding their positive and negative experiences with their closest social relationships, as well as assessments of their blood pressure, heart rate, stress and coping. Having more positive experiences in social relationships was generally associated with better coping, lower stress and lower systolic blood pressure, or spikes in blood pressure under stress, according to the study.  But having social relationships which bounce between good and bad often can be unhelpful. When there is a lot of volatility, the negative experiences seemed to have a bigger impact on a person than the positive, said lead study author Brian Don of the University of Auckland.  ""Both positive and negative experiences in our relationships contribute to our daily stress, coping, and physiology,"" Don said in a statement. ""Additionally, it's not just how we feel about our relationships overall that matters; the up's and downs are important too."" The results are not surprising, given that previous studies have also documented a link between healthy relationships and healthier bodies, said Dr. Kathleen Mullan Harris, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Harris was not involved in the study. But seeing how friendships affect specific aspects of physical health does add to the scientific understanding of the connection, she said.  The research, which took place from 2019 to the end of 2021, may also offer insight into the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which put strain on social relationships for many people, Don said.  ""Because the COVID-19 pandemic has created considerable strain, turbulence, and variability in people's relationships, it may indirectly alter stress, coping, and physiology in daily life, all of which have important implications for physical well-being,"" he added. Do good friendships lead to better health? It is important to remember that the study cannot prove that good relationships cause better health, Don said.  But it does show that physical health and social relationships are often intertwined, he said. And the association can also work the other way, Harris said. ""People who are in better health often have better relationships with people, because they're not moody, they're not grouchy, they're not in pain, they don't have worries,"" she said.  Don hopes that future studies expand the areas that are investigated. ""It would be useful to examine other physiological states, such as neuroendocrine or sympathetic nervous system responses as outcomes of daily positive and negative relationship experiences, which may reveal different patterns of associations,"" he said.  Making better relationships If hearing the importance of good social relationships makes you lament that you might not have enough, you aren't alone, said Adam Smiley Poswolsky, workplace belonging expert and author of ""Friendship in the Age of Loneliness.""  Many people may feel lonely and want closer connections, but the prospect of making new friendships — or strengthening existing ones — can be daunting, Poswolsky said.  ""It's intimidating to think about friendship in adulthood, and often overwhelm keeps us from even trying,"" he said. His suggestion? Start small. Text a friend that you haven't talked to in a long time, commit to meeting one new person a month, host a dinner party, or join a class. ""If you do just one thing, make a list of five people in your life that you care about, and give one of them a phone call,"" Poswolsky added. ""The most remarkable friendships often begin with tiniest moments of connection."" Remember that you likely won't form a strong connection overnight, he added.  Research shows that it takes 90 hours of time together to consider someone a friend and more than 200 hours to consider them a close friend that you have an emotional connection with, he said.  ""In our busy world, we need to put our friendship on the calendar, and commit to recurring activities,"" Poswolsky said.  But studies also reveal that it isn't just about having relationships — the quality matters. There might not be just one definition of a good friendship, but most strong relationships share some similar qualities, he said.  They tend to prioritize laughter, joy, excitement, courage, vulnerability, affirmation and a lack of judgment, Poswolsky said. And good friendships are often two people helping each other become better versions of themselves, he added. ""Even when — especially when — their friend is struggling or going through something hard,"" Poswolsky said. ""You know someone is a true friend when they have your back when you're sick, when you lose your job, when you make a mistake, when you're going through a break-up, when you're stressed, when you're sad.""

                      Let your pantry work for you with these easy kitchen organization tweaks
                  ","
                      Home organization shows can be simultaneously uplifting and deflating with rows of matching containers on every shelf of the pantry and cabinets. Typically they're in a gleaming white kitchen, no less. Let's leave the aesthetics aside for a moment, because I will be honest and tell you that I do not own a gorgeous kitchen. It is downright ugly in many respects, but it is functional. And function is the reason I'm making the argument that you should store your pantry ingredients in containers. Even if you're not using matched sets of brand-new modular storage or bins (and I'm not suggesting that you do), decanting ingredients from their bags and other packaging into containers is a smart move. Here's why I do it and why I believe everyone should start containing their ingredients. You'll save space and fit more in the pantry There's no one-size-fits-all solution for pantry storage because every kitchen layout has its own specific challenges. However, a general rule of thumb is that containers are simpler to store in cupboards and on shelves than bags.  Instead of piling bags and digging through the stack to find what you're looking for, containers are stackable and easily movable. One wrong grab can send a cascade of snack bags or granola bars crashing to the floor, but containers keep food in check. Both glass and plastic are durable, though families with kids frequently prefer plastic containers because of the weight and breakability factor. As for round versus square containers, ""round ones don't maximize the space in between"" as effectively as square or rectangular containers do, said Shara Kay, a Los Angeles-based certified professional organizer and owner of SK Organizing. My pantry storage situation includes a mix of airtight plastic rectangular containers, glass mason jars, larger restaurant-style food storage bins and repurposed containers — all from various brands in various sizes. Some are ingredient-specific, such as those for my brown sugar and granulated sugar, and others are generic containers.  For those with deep pantry shelves, a hybrid solution — aka ""containers for your containers"" — might be necessary. Open-top or open-front pantry storage bins can help group similar items together and allow you to pull out one large container rather than a lot of small jars or canisters. This works well for keeping ingredients such as baking soda, baking powder, vanilla extract and other baking-related items together.  If your shelves are less than 12 inches deep, according to Kay, you may not want to double up on bins. But if you have a deeper reach-in pantry, ""you probably do, because things will get lost in the back."" In my pantry, I have a mix of purchased bins and repurposed open box-style containers, including a few old letter trays from my office that hold small mason jars of my granola, dried fruit and other breakfast snacks. You'll waste less food Clear containers can help people visualize what they have immediately, Kay said, making it easy to see if there's enough penne in the pantry for tonight's dinner or if it's time to restock the black bean stash. If you always end up buying an extra box of pasta because you can't remember what you have on hand, containers may help with overbuying. Airtight containers also keep snacks and other loose items from losing their crunch too quickly. ""If you're taking a long time to consume things and they're going stale,"" Kay said, ""that's a good instance to decant."" Bag clips can't maintain an airtight seal, but if you store your half-open bags of Cheez-Its in a sealable container, you're winning the war. However, you'll still need to do routine pantry maintenance to make sure you're not leaving foods in bins for too long. It's smart to use the first-in, first-out rule with your ingredients, whether they're in the pantry, fridge or freezer. I personally don't buy so much food that I won't use it before it goes stale or past its expiration date, but if that's an issue in your house, keep track with writable stickers on your containers and bins. And if you have a few handfuls of ingredients left, Kay said, ""when you're decanting, use up the stuff at the bottom before adding to the top.""  Your food will be pest-proof No one wants to believe they could get pests in their pantry, but it's better to think about this situation before it happens. And as someone who lives in a century-old home, I'm here to give you the news firsthand: The pests will take the smallest opportunity to invade every single time. Whether plastic or glass, sealed containers are the best line of defense against rodents and insects. Kay's rule is ""the more airtight, the better,"" but I'll go one further. Containers beat bags every time because I have yet to meet a mouse, ant or moth that can penetrate a rigid container. And I unfortunately can't say the same for store packaging — even sealed cardboard boxes.  You don't need to go out and buy all new containers As convincing as my argument for containers may be, it doesn't mean you have to buy out your local home goods store immediately. Start with the containers you have on hand, such as mason jars or plastic bins. Or if you need to buy a set of containers, ""start with five and see how it goes,"" Kay said. ""If it's working for you, then acquire more."" Similarly, ""don't go decanting every single snack in your pantry on the first go-round,"" Kay added. She recommends starting with baking staples such as flour and sugar as well as other items that are usually scooped and measured incrementally rather than all at once. Rice or grains and dried beans are ideal candidates, as are nuts and dried fruit. For those who still want to keep ingredients in their bagged packaging, you have two options. One is to store your open bags of snacks in larger sealable containers, as mentioned earlier, and the second is to stack your bags in open-top bins.  ""My family won't eat some food if it's not in the original packaging because they're drawn to the original packaging,"" Kay admitted. As you start transitioning to the container method of pantry storage, you'll find the right balance for your family as well.

                      'Everything has changed': Users of recalled eye drops describe permanent vision problems after infections
                  ","
                      Renee Martray of South Carolina has severe and permanent corneal scarring resulting in vision loss. She says it's like trying to peer through eyeglasses that have been dipped in oil. Nancy Montz of Ohio developed a corneal ulcer, spent three weeks in the hospital and lost vision in her left eye.  Carla Oliva of Florida developed a severe eye infection and, when treatment failed, had to have her right eye removed. She's now legally blind. The women said their problems began after they used EzriCare Artificial Tears, which is part of a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Food and Drug Administration investigation into a multistate outbreak of a rare strain of bacteria. EzriCare said in a statement last month that when it learned of the investigation January 20, it was not aware of any testing that definitively linked the outbreak to its product.  ""Nonetheless, we immediately took action to stop any further distribution or sale of EzriCare Artificial Tears. To the greatest extent possible, we have been contacting customers to advise them against continued use of the product."" EzriCare did not respond to CNN's request for comment this week. The artificial tears are made by India-based Global Pharma Healthcare, which issued a recall of both EzriCare and Delsam Pharma artificial tears.  Delsam Pharma's product has not been linked to infections, but the CDC and US Food and Drug Administration have advised patients to stop using eye drops from either company pending additional guidance.  Since the start of its investigation, the CDC has identified 68 people in 16 states with infections of a rare strain of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never before been reported in the United States.  There have been three deaths, eight cases of vision loss and four surgical eye removals reported, according to the CDC.  The investigation started with three distinct outbreaks and no apparent connection, said Dr. Maroya Walters, public health service officer and the CDC's lead investigator on the outbreak. The agency was initially notified in late June 2022 about eye infections among four people at an ophthalmology clinic in California, and tests revealed the unexpected bacteria behind them, Walters said. The bacteria had a mutation that makes it highly resistant to drugs designed to treat it. This type of drug-resistant Pseudomonas had never been associated with an eye infection, Walters said.  Walters told CNN two other infection outbreaks were reported at long-term care facilities. One involved 21 people in Connecticut in late July and another included three people in Utah in August. Genetic sequencing in September revealed that the three bacterial strains were nearly identical, Walters said.  ""The patients had very, very few overarching commonalities. They were from different kinds of facilities that had different kinds of infections,"" Walters said. ""We were really looking comprehensively at products that patients received but not finding a lot of commonalities."" 'What did I do?' As the investigators were searching for a common source, eye drop users searched for answers. Oliva, 68, says she was given EzriCare artificial tears for dry eyes from a medical center in Hialeah, Florida, in May. After using the drops for two months, she woke up August 1 with burning, itchiness, redness and tearing in her right eye. She went to an ophthalmologist, who said she had a corneal scratch and prescribed antibiotics, but her symptoms just got worse. She then went to Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, where physicians discovered a large ulcer associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Oliva says she went to Bascom Palmer every day from August 4 to September 1 to receive topical antibiotics. They also tried stronger and stronger medications, but the infection persisted. Doctors attempted to do a cornea transplant August 29, but the infection was too severe to save the eye. It was surgically removed September 1 and replaced with a plastic implant at the end of December.  She spent months wondering what happened.  ""I cried constantly, asking why this happened to me. How could this have happened to me? I was searching for an answer: What happened to me? At what moment? How? When? What did I do?"" she told CNN in Spanish. ""And to not have an answer, that is the most terrible thing.""  But because she didn't know about the investigation until after she lost her eye, she continued to use the drops. Martray, 48, also had dry eyes and bought the artificial tears at a store in South Carolina last summer. After using them for about a month, she began having pain, swelling, burning, blurry vision, watering and redness.  She went to an eye doctor and got antibiotics to try to treat the infection. But she continued to use the drops until October.  In December, the infection returned. She says she went to the clinic every day, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. She was eventually diagnosed with severe, permanent corneal scarring.  She says her condition left her ""very depressed.""  ""When it first came about, I just didn't even want to leave the house. I just laid around and cried. I just wanted to get better,"" she said. Detecting future outbreaks Similar cases were being reported across the country. According to a statement released January 20 from the CDC, from May 17 to January 19, the agency, in partnership with state and local health departments, identified the bacteria in 50 people across 11 states, with 38 cases linked to four health care facility outbreaks. Most of the people reported using artificial tears, the CDC said, and EzriCare Artificial Tears was the brand most commonly reported. The agency's lab testing confirmed the presence of the outbreak strain in opened eye drop bottles. Researchers are now testing unopened bottles for the same bacteria. Walters attributes the discovery in large part to sequencing and reporting done at state and local health departments. ""I think without that, we never would have found this outbreak, and we need to really keep those programs strong, because I'm sure this is not the last time,"" she said. ""We need to maintain these activities to be able to detect future outbreaks and to be even faster at detecting them and finding the source."" Walters says the CDC continues to receive reports of ""catastrophic and life-altering infections,"" many of them months old. 'I feel useless' Oliva said she learned about the eye drop recall on the news early this year. At first, she felt relieved.  ""On the other hand, I felt anger and indignation, because how could they be so negligent, so careless to make a product that could cost someone's life?"" said Oliva, who has filed a lawsuit against several companies including EzriCare and Global Pharma.  She says she's had to learn how to walk again due to new issues with stability. She has trouble driving, working or doing everyday tasks like going to the grocery store. ""Everything has changed. I feel useless."" Martray, who has also filed a lawsuit against several companies including EzriCare and Global Pharma, said she learned about the bacteria from news articles her daughter sent her. ""I'm really shocked, because I've always just -- I just trusted,"" she said. ""I feel that if they're made for the eyes and the box is sealed and everything, it's good.  I never thought that something like that could happen. They were sealed bottle drops. You just grab them, you put them in your eyes, you don't even think twice about it. Especially when you've been wearing contacts since sixth grade."" EzriCare and Global Pharma did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuits or the ongoing investigation. CNN initially reached out to EzriCare on March 17. Learning to adjust Montz, 72, had used EzriCare tears for about a week in November when she started noticing blurry vision. One morning, she woke to find yellow discharge on her pillow. She went to the emergency room, where doctors discovered a large ulcer on her left cornea, involving nearly the entire eye. She spent three weeks in the hospital, where she got antibiotics and multiple surgeries. Her case was complicated by a serous choroidal detachment, an abnormal accumulation of fluid, which ultimately led to vision loss in the left eye. She said she's learning to accept her situation and feels ""pretty good"" despite weeks of treatment. ""It is what it is. Me being crabby is not going to change anything, I have to make the best of it, accept it and go on,"" she said. Martray says she's been having frequent migraines from straining her eyes and can no longer do many things she previously enjoyed, like baking or crafts. ""You don't realize how much you rely on your vision for, I mean, just everything. Your vision is everything,"" she said.  Oliva wants accountability for what happened to her and others.  ""I want those responsible for doing this to me and other people to pay for their negligence, because they were negligent. They marketed something that was contaminated,"" she said. ""They played with my life and my family's life.""

                      'Equal opportunity to be healthy': Stricter air pollution standards would benefit some populations more than others, study says
                  ","
                      Everyone benefits when there is less air pollution, but it pays off more for older communities with high poverty rates and those where larger populations of Black people live, regardless of income, a new study finds. The study, published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at the connection between deaths and a type of air pollution called PM2.5. The US Environmental Protection Agency said in January that it is trying to determine how it can best create regulations to strengthen the standards for PM2.5 pollution. The researchers on the new study said that with that in mind, they wanted to provide policy-makers with additional evidence on how marginalized communities, which already tend to have poorer health outcomes, are disproportionately affected by air pollution.  Other studies have shown this connection for individual groups such as people of color or those with low income, but these researchers wanted to look at the effects on communities based simultaneously on socioeconomic status and race.  Fine particulate matter, or particle pollution, is the mix of solid and liquid droplets floating in the air. It can come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires. PM2.5 has particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. It's so tiny -- 1/20th the width of a human hair -- that it can travel past your body's usual defenses when you breathe it in. Instead of being carried out of your body when you exhale, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. In the short term, the pollution can irritate the eyes, nose, throat and lungs and cause coughing, sneezing or shortness of breath. Long-term, this dirty air can also cause lasting damage and lead to health conditions like obesity, cancer, stroke, heart problems, asthma, depression, anxiety and even premature death. In 2019 alone, long-term exposure to particle pollution contributed to 4 million deaths worldwide. For the new study, researchers analyzed Medicare data from 73 million people who were 65 or older from 2000 through 2016. They estimated the associations between annual PM2.5 exposure and mortality in communities defined by racial identity (Black vs. White) and income level (Medicaid-eligible vs. ineligible).  Everyone would benefit from cleaner air, they found, but higher- and lower-income Black people and low-income White people may benefit more from lower PM2.5 levels than higher-income White people. The EPA is trying to determine how much stricter US air pollution safety standards should be. It's considering lowering the standards from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to between 9 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter.  This study suggests that if the EPA were to go even further and lower the standard to 8 micrograms, the US would have a 4% reduction in overall mortality rate, study co-author Dr. Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics, population and data science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said.  These stricter standards would have even more advantage for Black people. The mortality rate would be 7% lower among Black people who have what the researchers defined as a ""higher"" income, meaning anyone who was not eligible for Medicaid, and a 6% rate reduction among Black people with a lower income. Medicaid eligibility requires earnings below the federal poverty level, which was $13,590 for a single adult and $27,750 for a family of four in 2022.  ""So you've doubled the mortality rate rate reduction by putting more stringent standards for marginalized communities,"" Dominici said. ""To me, that was surprising, how much more benefit you're going to get.""  The study can't specifically get at the reasons for this difference, but Dominici has a few ideas. ""It's potentially due to the social structure forces that lead to discrimination and social exclusion,"" she said, rather than to biological differences. Other studies have shown that, regardless of income or region, decades of segregation mean Black people tend to live in areas where there is greater exposure to air pollution.  This study is looking at an older population, Dominici said, meaning its participants were born when segregated neighborhoods were common.  ""I think that it could be the combined effect of living through these times of being denied an equal opportunity to be healthy,"" she said. In general, Black Americans have less access to health care and higher rates of health problems, and they breathe a higher level of pollution. ""There is enormous evidence of environmental inequities in the United States, and so with more stringent pollution standards, there will be more equity,"" Dominici said. ""We are at a crucial time when the EPA is thinking about more stringent standards, so it will be important to think about the context involved and to really think through these decisions with regard to environmental justice, race and social class.""

                      Alzheimer's first signs may appear in your eyes, study finds
                  ","
                      The eyes are more than a window to the soul — they're also a reflection of a person's cognitive health.  ""The eye is the window into the brain,"" said ophthalmologist Dr. Christine Greer, director of medical education at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. ""You can see directly into the nervous system by looking into the back of the eye, toward the optic nerve and retina."" Research has been exploring how the eye may help in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease before symptoms begin. The disease is well advanced by the time memory and behavior are affected.  ""Alzheimer's disease begins in the brain decades before the first symptoms of memory loss,"" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer's preventive neurologist who is also at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases.  If doctors are able to identify the disease in its earliest stages, people could then make healthy lifestyle choices and control their ""modifiable risk factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes,"" Isaacson said, The eye knows Just how early can we see signs of cognitive decline? To find out, a recent study examined donated tissue from the retina and brains of 86 people with different degrees of mental decline.  ""Our study is the first to provide in-depth analyses of the protein profiles and the molecular, cellular, and structural effects of Alzheimer's disease in the human retina and how they correspond with changes in the brain and cognitive function,"" said senior author Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, a professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, in a statement.  ""These changes in the retina correlated with changes in parts of the brain called the entorhinal and temporal cortices, a hub for memory, navigation and the perception of time,"" Koronyo-Hamaoui said.  Investigators in the study collected retinal and brain tissue samples over 14 years from 86 human donors with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment —  the largest group of retinal samples ever studied, according to the authors.  Researchers then compared samples from donors with normal cognitive function to those with mild cognitive impairment and those with later-stage Alzheimer's disease.   The study, published in February in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, found significant increases in beta-amyloid, a key marker of Alzheimer's disease, in people with both Alzheimer's and early cognitive decline. Microglial cells declined by 80% in those with cognitive issues, the study found. These cells are responsible for repairing and maintaining other cells, including clearing beta-amyloid from the brain and retina. ""Markers of inflammation were (also) found, which may be an equally important marker for disease progression,"" said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. ""The findings were also apparent in people with no or minimal cognitive symptoms, which suggests these new eye tests may be well-positioned to aid in early diagnosis."" The study researchers found higher numbers of immune cells tightly surrounding amyloid beta plaques as well as other cells responsible for inflammation and cell and tissue death. Tissue atrophy and inflammation in cells in the far periphery of the retina were most predictive of cognitive status, the study found.   ""These findings may eventually lead to the development of imaging techniques that allow us to diagnose Alzheimer's disease earlier and more accurately,"" Isaacson said, ""and monitor its progression noninvasively by looking through the eye.""

                      'I don't trust myself.' For Muslims with eating disorders, fasting in Ramadan brings another set of challenges
                  ","
                      As the Islamic holy month of Ramadan begins, Habiba says she is ""terrified"" by the thought of fasting this year. After her disordered eating patterns spiraled into bulimia and binge eating disorder during her mid-teens, she says the ritual of abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset can exacerbate the need to restrict her eating further and risk slipping into a toxic cycle.  But making the decision to refrain from the practice feels like she is neglecting a key part of her faith, she says. ""I don't trust myself with keeping a fast because I know ... I'll start to enjoy the feelings of hunger and I'm terrified (of) what that will do to me,"" said the 30-year-old UK-based Muslim editor, who asked CNN to use only her first name for privacy reasons. ""I do feel sad. I feel like I'm missing out on a really spiritual experience."" Habiba was nine years old when she first had the urge to make herself sick, she says. By the age of about 16 she says she was skipping meals, tracking calories, blacking out as a result of hunger, overexercising and vomiting at least 15 times a day.   ""I would never wish something like bulimia, especially, on anyone, because it's like an addiction.""  Habiba is not alone in her experience. A growing number of Muslim doctors and psychologists are trying to bridge the gap between faith leaders and worshippers like Habiba, who say they face marginalization when trying to access support within their own communities, as well as in the public health system. ""Minorities are underrepresented. It's not that they don't have eating disorders or suffer, but there is all this stigma around who comes to get help,"" Dr. Omara Naseem, a UK-based counseling psychologist who specializes in treating eating disorders, said. These are ""invisible and indiscriminate"" illnesses that transcend age, religion, gender and sexuality, she added. ""It's an act of worship to take care of your body and health. Therefore, go and get the right help that you need,"" she said. Creating a 'binge purge cycle' During Ramadan, Muslims are encouraged to hydrate and eat a balanced meal before sunrise and then break their fast with a date and water at sunset, followed by a larger meal. Worshippers also engage in other forms of practice including increased prayer, giving more to charity, volunteering and participating in communal meals.   However, the act of fasting during daylight hours can mask restrictive dieting patterns associated with eating disorders, said Naseem. Exercising control and experiencing hunger while fasting could generate a desire to binge large amounts of food quickly at iftar -- the breaking of the fast after sundown -- which could result in feeling out of control and ""ashamed,"" creating a ""binge purge cycle"" and setting back recovery, she added.  According to the Quran, people who are sick or traveling are not required to fast as long as they make up fasts once they are healthy or feed less fortunate Muslims throughout the month. Therefore, if someone has an illness or condition that is verified by a medical professional, they are not required to fast, said Imam Nadim Ali, a Muslim faith leader and licensed professional counselor based in Atlanta, Georgia.  For example, children and the elderly and people who are pregnant, menstruating, or require daily medication are exempt from fasting. However, community and society-wide taboos mean that mental health illnesses are not given credence in the same way as physical sickness, both Naseem and Ali said. That means those who choose not to fast due to mental health illnesses face ""guilt and shame"" from their communities and wider society, added Naseem. Cultural barriers Habiba said she has childhood memories of having her body constantly audited by members of her extended family, a behavior she says is symptomatic of the cultural pressures some South Asian and Muslim girls face as they enter womanhood. When she was 15, she remembers an uncle telling her she'd ""gotten fat"" after returning from a family trip to Turkey. ""Comments like that stick forever,"" she said. Over the following years, her weight dropped drastically. At the same time, she remembers being told by extended family members that she could no longer play outside and skateboard with her boy cousins. Instead, she was encouraged to hang out with her girl peers and play with makeup. Despite having ""liberal"" parents, she said, she believes her eating disorder was partly a response to the pressure of fitting into strict gender roles assigned by her community and wider society. When she was about 16, Habiba said her eating disorder symptoms worsened until her parents took her to a local doctor. She received outpatient psychiatric care at a children's mental health unit until she was 18, when she was transferred to an adult mental health unit. However, she says the cultural differences between herself and the White therapists she saw meant they could not understand the nuanced pressures she faced as a woman in her community; and how they were intrinsically tied to her eating disorder.  ""I had White therapists who just did not understand and would really just be very condescending about, you know, things that I wanted to talk about or things I was struggling with.""  Farheen Hasan, a 27-year-old research psychologist based in Bristol, southwest England, agrees that there's a need for therapists to understand specific cultural pressures.  At the age of 18, Hasan said she started to exhibit disordered eating patterns in the form of avoiding food, over-exercising and becoming obsessed with healthy eating. Every year, she said she faced an internal struggle over whether or not to fast during Ramadan.  ""I think we need access to therapists who understand our culture, religion and struggle -- and who can provide professional guidance and support,"" she told CNN over email. Getting help Habiba and Hasan's stories reflect the systemic challenges people from underserved communities widely face when accessing mental health support.  Even though people of color have higher rates of some mental health disorders than White people, they face greater disparities in getting help due to institutional discrimination and interpersonal racism and stigma. Black, indigenous and people of color are significantly less likely than White people to have been asked by a doctor about eating disorder symptoms, and are half as likely to be diagnosed or to receive treatment, according to a report by the US National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. Halima Eid, a licensed professional clinical counselor and co-founder of AMALY, a California-based non-profit organization that aims to challenge the stigma around mental health in Muslim communities, said it can be hard for people in those spaces to access the information they need.  Eid established AMALY in 2020 to offer accessible therapy services, workshops, support groups and educational talks that are tailored to her local Muslim community in San Diego, California.  She also offers services online that extend to Muslims globally.  Last spring, she set up a virtual support group to help Muslims with eating disorders as they navigate Ramadan. She said that after the screening process about 30 people initially registered across two cohorts, including Muslims from the US, Australia and the UK. She intends to run the same group this year. ""It is a very lonely experience to suffer from any disease or disorder on your own,"" she said. ""Then there's the guilt that they're not pleasing Allah and they're not being good Muslims. So, we challenge perfectionism in Islam, perfectionism as Muslims during Ramadan, because a lot of people struggle."" Both Eid and Naseem, the UK-based counseling psychologist, use their Islamic and medical knowledge to serve Muslims that seek support from mental health professionals, who have a similar lived experience as women who practice Islam. ""I can offer a unique perspective ... it helps you use your skill set for good to groups that maybe wouldn't engage or wouldn't feel comfortable speaking to somebody who isn't from their background,"" said Naseem, who has created a Ramadan guide offering nutrition and faith-based advice for Muslims with eating disorders. Breaking a cycle of shame  Habiba says her bulimia reached a turning point several years ago, when she returned home from a friend's baby shower and made herself sick after eating cakes and sweet treats. ""I remember just looking at my body and being like, I don't like this. I don't like the way that I look and I don't think I'm ever going to love myself, but I think I just need to accept it,"" she said. ""I don't know if I can ever say that I'm fully recovered. I know that I still have that voice ... in my head. But it's quieter now."" Now, she said she is able to keep her eating disorder at bay by identifying her triggers and forcing herself to eat when she is drawn towards restrictive dieting patterns.  Ramadan and Eid celebrations can trigger her eating disorder, she said, because she experienced pressure to eat large amounts of food at iftar, and received judgmental comments from family members who might not understand her decision not to fast. Hasan, the Bristol-based research psychologist, said Muslims in their position need ""social acceptance"" from community leaders. ""A lot of stress and mental toll would be reduced if we had acceptance and acknowledgment in the community that people struggle in different ways, and we should understand and accept them, instead of stigmatising them,"" she said. Habiba said she still misses the communal aspect of breaking fasts during Ramadan, attending family dinners and counting down the days until Eid al-Fitr, the festivities that mark the end of Ramadan.  ""I do feel like I'm left out of the club,"" Habiba said, adding that she hopes she'll get to a point in the future where she can fast again and be sure that her faith, rather than a desire to restrict her calorie intake, is her motivation. Ali, the Atlanta-based Imam and counselor, suggested ways that Muslims with eating disorders can engage with the holy month aside from fasting, including reading the Quran, attending nightly taraweeh prayers, and donating to a feeding program.  He said faith leaders and family members should acknowledge the challenges Muslims with mental health struggles face during Ramadan, and offer them guidance to help break the intergenerational cycle of shame and guilt that exists across society. ""Islam is a religion that does not want people to jeopardize their lives to engage in forms of worship,"" he said. ""I think the important thing is for us religious leaders to be able to show empathy to the least among us, the most vulnerable among us.""

                      'Harry Potter' and 'Game of Thrones' franchises to get fresh life on newly minted Max streamer
                  ","
                      Fantasy freaks and noble nerds unite.  Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Wednesday that the 'Game of Thrones' and 'Harry Potter' franchises will take on new life at the studio's newly minted streaming service Max.  For those who are eager to soar back into the wizarding world of 'Harry Potter,' buckle up because the franchise is coming to Max in the form of a scripted television series. (CNN and Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) The series will be a ""faithful adaptation"" of the beloved ""Harry Potter"" books by author J.K. Rowling, who will also serve as an executive producer on the project, according to a news release. Rowling's ""Potter"" books were published between 1997 and 2007.  The television series will feature a cast of fresh new faces to take on the roles made famous in the ""Potter"" films by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.  The series is expected to run for an unprecedented 10 years with the promise that each season ""will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core.""  Over in Westeros, Max will launch a second prequel series in the ""Game of Thrones"" universe, titled ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight"" based on author George R.R. Martin's 2013 ""Dunk and Egg"" novellas.  The prequel is set a century before the events of the original ""Game of Thrones,"" which ran from 2011 to 2019, and will center on the wanderings of ""two unlikely heroes,"" Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, according to a news release. ""Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends,"" the release said.   The announcement for a new ""Thrones"" prequel comes after ""House of the Dragon"" debuted in 2022. ""Dragon"" is also a prequel series, based on the Targaryen civil war and set nearly 200 years prior to ""Game of Thrones."" It's based on Martin's ""Fire & Blood"" book from 2018.   Release dates for both new series have not yet been announced.

                      Father of Lisa Marie Presley's youngest daughters petitions to represent them in battle over estate
                  ","
                      A court hearing was held in Los Angeles on Thursday related to the petition Priscilla Presley filed in January that challenges the validity of her daughter, Lisa Marie Presley's will.  Priscilla Presley did not appear at the hearing, nor did her grandaughter, actor Riley Keough, who is the primary beneficiary of Lisa Marie Presley's estate. The court on Thursday considered an ex parte petition filed by Michael Lockwood, the father of Lisa Marie Presley's youngest daughters, twins Finley and Harper, to be named their guardian ad litem regarding their late mother's will. Scott Rahn, Lockwood's lawyer, said he is ""ready, able and willing to protect their interests.""  Attorneys for Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough did not contest Lockwood being named their guardian ad litem. Judge Lynn Healy Scaduto said she would issue a written ruling on the matter. Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis Presley's only child, died in January after being hospitalized following an apparent cardiac arrest at her Los Angeles home.  In a court filing obtained by CNN, Priscilla Presley's petition disputes a 2016 amendment to her daughter's will which states that Lisa Marie Presley removed her mother and former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees, replacing them with her children Riley and Benjamin Keough. Benjamin Keough later died in 2020. The petition alleges that Priscilla Presley did not receive the amendment while her daughter was alive, as required by her Trust, and that the document misspells Priscilla's name. The petition also alleged that the amendment was not witnessed or notarized and questioned the authenticity of Lisa Marie Presley's signature.  Attorneys for Priscilla Presley filed the petition just days after Lisa Marie Presley was laid to rest at Elvis's former residence, Graceland. The next hearing to address the matter is scheduled for May 16.

                      'Renfield' sinks its teeth into gore at the expense of its Dracula satire
                  ","
                      Dwight Frye is hardly a household name, but the character actor left his mark on Universal horror movies of the 1930s, including his portrayal of Dracula's maniacal henchman in the Bela Legosi classic. Enter ""Renfield,"" a cheeky homage to the vampire genre that blends horror and comedy into a beyond-bloody cocktail, with Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage sinking their teeth into the too-thin material. Produced and conceived by Robert Kirkman of ""The Walking Dead"" renown, ""Renfield"" begins promisingly enough, with Hoult's Renfield -- Dracula's ""familiar,"" or the human servant who tends to his daytime needs -- sitting in on a support group for people in abusive relationships. There's also a spot-on replication of the old black-and-white movies, with just the smallest hint of Renfield's wheezing laugh. Those wrinkles, however, amount to false advertising for a movie that derives most of its humor from over-the-top gore, an amusing-in-theory notion that inevitably yields diminishing returns even spread over a relatively brisk 90-some-odd minutes. ""Renfield"" is so much better when the film is having fun with vampire-movie minutia -- like Dracula (Cage) needing to be invited into places, or the particulars of how to kill him -- that the broadness of those visual gags make it feel like an underachiever, especially when compared to something that gets the balance right, like the FX series ""What We Do in the Shadows."" Directed by Chris McKay (""The LEGO Batman Movie"") from a script by Ryan Ridley, ""Renfield"" also introduces a sort-of relationship between its title character and a principled cop, Rebecca (Awkwafina, underemployed here), who brings out his desire to be a better man. Then again, he's already exhibited those impulses by having sought to steer his boss toward more-deserving victims, while Dracula thirsts for nuns and cheerleaders. The makeup effects are bountiful and fairly impressive, with Renfield deriving super-human strength from consuming insects, which he gets to put into use against the mobsters Rebecca is obsessed with putting behind bars. Yet the way those visual elements are applied does more to narrow the movie's appeal than expand it, catering to a subset of the horror audience at the expense of those who might show up expecting something closer to a Mel Brooks-like spoof. What's billed as a horror-comedy thus can't entirely decide where it wishes to land on that spectrum, in a movie that benefits from letting Cage cut loose without fully capitalizing upon his full-throated performance. Universal has creatively sought to mine equity from its monster library, and ""Renfield"" certainly brings those efforts into the 21st century, for better and worse. And while Renfield might be trapped in a ""destructive relationship"" with a cruel and demanding master, the filmmakers have only themselves to blame for their questionable choices. ""Renfield"" premieres April 14 in US theaters. It's rated R.

                      'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's' final season sticks to the same old routine
                  ","
                      The curtain is coming down on ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" whose act -- an Emmy winner in its first season -- has seen better days. Having left its mark for Amazon, the nostalgic comedy tries to bring home the story of its central character without venturing far from the rat-a-tat tone that defined the series initially, and that by season five, has grown tedious. Reflecting that the end is nigh, several of the episodes incorporate flash-forwards, providing a tantalizing taste of the future Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) and how her showbiz career (and by extension, life) has gone. That journey begins with Midge's agent, Susie (Alex Borstein), trying to land her a job writing for the latenight TV show hosted by Gordon Ford (Reid Scott, an excellent regular addition), a thinly veiled stand-in for Johnny Carson who is going toe-to-toe with Carson's predecessor, Jack Paar. Midge's interactions within that male-dominated bastion introduce a nice hook for the new season, which now takes place, largely, in the early 1960s. Midge also deals with a lot of the usual mishegas involving her parents (Tony Shalhoub, Marin Hinkle) and in-laws (Kevin Pollak, Caroline Aaron), while her ex-husband Joel (Michael Zegen) wrestles with his own issues after their split. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino specializes in characters that all tend to speak with the same witty voice, and exposing Midge to comics and comedy writers makes that tick feel a little less conspicuous. It's also interesting getting a glimpse of where Midge wound up, as well as the influence that her rising star had on those around her. For the most part, though, the last few seasons of ""Mrs. Maisel"" have felt like a comic stalling for time, vamping until the next act can make it to the mic. The initial conceit of a woman stumbling into standup in the 1950s possessed a clear charm -- particularly with Lenny Bruce's in-and-out presence, as played by Luke Kirby -- that the series often lacked as Midge settled into the business, facing the various challenges and impediments thrown her way. Despite the quality of the cast and the knowing winks to the excesses and sexism of its era, ""Mrs. Maisel"" has always felt like a particularly light construct, which is why the prospect of a final season in theory provides the show with a level of focus and momentum it has lacked. And to some extent, that's true. Having come this far, there's inevitable curiosity about what the world held for a promising female comic who had the audacity to start slinging jokes in the Eisenhower era. But watching these episodes, with their detours and digressions, it seems fairly clear that for better or worse, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" can't stray too far from the comfort of its old routine. ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" begins its fifth and final season April 14 with three new episodes on Amazon's Prime Video.

                      Dominion Voting Systems can't bring up the January 6 insurrection during its upcoming defamation trial against Fox News, a Delaware judge ruled Tuesday, who also revealed at a hearing that he has been receiving death threats. The voting technology company sued Fox News over the right-wing network's promotions of false claims that Dominion machines rigged the 2020 election. But almost all of the allegedly defamatory statements mentioned in Dominion's lawsuit occurred before the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said at a hearing Tuesday that invoking January 6 would be too prejudicial with the jury, and that the case isn't about whether Fox News ""influenced"" the insurrection.  ""That may be for another court at another time, but it's not for this court at this time,"" Davis said.  The judge issued rulings on nearly two dozen pretrial motions that will set the stage for the historic trial, which is set to kick off this week, with jury selection on Thursday. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. Fox says it didn't defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Threats against the judge The judge also revealed Tuesday that he has received death threats.  ""I've sent you things that I've received,"" Davis told lawyers from both sides, during a discussion about separate death threats targeting Dominion employees.  The discussion revolved around whether Dominion can bring up the threats and harassment that its employees have faced after the 2020 election, which one Dominion lawyer said has instilled ""terror"" among its employees and has ""devastated"" the company's ability to recruit and retain staff.  Davis ruled that Dominion can tell the jury about the existence of the threats, but can't get into the content of the threats, because Fox obviously doesn't directly control what uninvolved third parties say.  ""I'm not downplaying it,"" Davis said to the Dominion lawyers. ""You need to take every threat seriously. I take every threat seriously."" Dominion has argued that many of the threats were inspired by Fox, which the network denies. If Dominion wins, it wants Fox to pay for the beefed-up security measures that it implemented after 2020.  A court spokesperson declined to comment about the threats against Davis. The judge did not disclose any details about the threats against him, or whether any of them were deemed credible. Flurry of pretrial rulings Davis ruled in Dominion's favor on other key questions, blocking Fox from making some First Amendment arguments and from bringing up evidence that it thought would help its defense.   The judge ruled that Fox can't bring up broadcasts where reporters accurately fact-checked Trump's lies about the 2020 election, to prove that other broadcasts that amplified those lies weren't defamatory.  Those other broadcasts ""are not relevant"" to the case, Davis said, because ""you can't absolve yourself of defamation by putting someone else on at a different time"" who told the truth about Dominion.   The judge also ruled that Fox can't use internal Dominion emails where its staffers said their products ""suck"" and were ""riddled with bugs,"" to prove that there were real concerns about Dominion machines. Those emails weren't public in 2020, so they couldn't have influenced the state of mind of Fox staffers when they promoted the Dominion claims on their shows.  But if Dominion wins and the case moves to damages, Fox can bring up these emails to show that Dominion might be losing business because of voting security concerns and not just because of alleged defamation.  Later in the hearing, Davis cleared the way for Dominion to bring up Fox's financial information at the trial, including details about salaries of top hosts and executives. Fox tried to block this from the trial, arguing that salaries aren't linked to ratings, and that this data could bias the jury against the network.  ""Economics are relevant,"" Davis said.   Judge scolds Fox for obfuscating Murdoch's role In an unexpected twist near the end of the daylong hearing, the judge scolded Fox's lawyers after Dominion revealed that network had serially obfuscated Rupert Murdoch's official role at the company. Murdoch is the chairman of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News. The network's lawyers have maintained for years that he had no official title at Fox News. But over the weekend, they conceded that he is also an officer at Fox News. This distinction -- albeit technical -- could have significant legal implications. Dominion claimed this blocked them from getting Murdoch-related documents in discovery. And by further tying Murdoch to Fox News, and not just to its parent company, Dominion may have more paths to prove actual malice. ""You have a credibility problem,"" Davis told Fox's lawyers, adding, ""I don't know if this is something that we have to turn the battleship around,"" with the trial looming, but ""I need to feel comfortable that when you represent something with me that it's the truth -- and that was not true."" A Fox lawyer pushed back by saying Murdoch's role at Fox News was just an ""honorific title"" and that he wasn't directly involved with any of the allegedly defamatory broadcasts after the 2020 election. ""I hope you're not being cagey with me,"" Davis continued. ""...I don't know why this is such a difficult thing... To say you don't know who your officers are, seems extremely bizarre to me."" As the hearing wrapped, Davis brought up the subject again, clearly frustrated by the revelation. ""I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the situation I'm in,"" Davis told the Fox lawyers. ""...It was represented to me on multiple occasions that he's not an officer at Fox News."" In a statement late Tuesday night, a Fox spokesperson pushed back on Dominion's claims that it withheld information about Murdoch's role. ""Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings since 2019 and this filing was referenced by Dominion's own attorney during his deposition,"" the spokesperson said.

                      Sky News Australia quits TikTok, says security risks 'too great' for media
                  ","
                      Australian broadcaster Sky News has left TikTok because of security concerns that have led several Western governments to ban the video app on devices used by officials. In an article published on the Sky News Australia website Monday, digital editor Jack Houghton said the security risks posed by the ""Beijing-controlled platform"" were ""too great for any serious news publisher."" ""TikTok is a spy network masquerading as a social media platform which has been proven to illegally pilfer the data of journalists, public citizens and politicians,"" Houghton wrote.  ""We urge [media organizations] to consider this dilemma and stop trading security and integrity for a few worthless views,"" he added. In a statement to CNN, Lee Hunter, General Manager of Operations for TikTok in Australia and New Zealand, said he respects the broadcaster's right to make decisions to best serve its audience, but rejected the ""allegations and insinuations"" made in the Sky News Australia article. ""[They] are completely false and we reject them in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. Experts say the security fears behind the recent government bans, while serious, currently appear to reflect only the potential for TikTok to be used for foreign intelligence, not that it has been. There is still no public evidence the Chinese government has actually spied on people through TikTok. Sky News Australia is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and is a separate entity to UK broadcaster Sky News, which is owned by Sky Group, a division of US conglomerate Comcast.  Last year, TikTok's owner ByteDance admitted that four employees had improperly accessed personal data of two journalists from the Financial Times and BuzzFeed. ByteDance said the relevant staff were investigating potential information leaks, and they were fired for misusing their authority to access TikTok user data. Separately, broader concerns have been raised by experts worldwide that TikTok presents a security risk due to the vast troves of data it collects on millions of users, and its vulnerability to potential interference from the Chinese government, which wields considerable influence over businesses in its jurisdiction. Government bans The United States and other Western nations have banned the app on government devices, with the Biden administration threatening to go further by imposing a broader ban unless TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company. A blanket ban would deny 150 million US users access to the platform.  TikTok has repeatedly denied it has links to Beijing, and the company's CEO Shou Chew recently told a US congressional hearing that he'd seen no evidence that the Chinese government had access to user data and had never asked for it. Moreover, he said the amount of information the company collects on users is no more than most industry players. While a number of governments have moved to delete TikTok from their employees' phones, most major news companies are yet to follow. Last month, the BBC advised staff to delete TikTok from their work phones, following a similar move by Danish public broadcaster, DR, but the British broadcaster still publishes its content on the short form video app to millions of followers.  Sky News Australia's Houghton said the decision by the BBC to ban the app yet publish content on the platform was a ""paradox"" that ""proves the hunger for reaching new demographics has perverted editorial strategies in newsrooms globally."" CNN has reached out to the BBC for comment. Before it deleted its account, Houghton said Sky News Australia had 65,000 followers and ""many millions of video views."" The channel is known for its conservative commentary and last year was described in a report by UK think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue as ""an important right-wing outlet with growing influence internationally.""  In relation to the climate crisis, it was also described as ""content hub for influencers, sceptics and outlets across the globe.""  In 2021, YouTube banned Sky News Australia from uploading new content for one week for posting misinformation about the Covid pandemic.  At the time, the broadcaster issued a statement rejecting allegations that its host had denied the existence of Covid-19, and that it had published or removed videos that showed them saying as much. Houghton also argued in an online article that the decision was ""a disturbing attack on the ability to think freely.""

""Time, mystical time/Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine/Were there clues I didn't see?"" the lyrics read. ""Isn't it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me?"" ""The 1"" is a song about a love that didn't work out. ""But we were something, don't you think so?/Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool/And if my wishes came true/It would've been you,"" Swift sings. ""In my defense, I have none/For never leaving well enough alone/But it would've been fun/If you would've been the one."" CNN has reached out to a representative of Swift for comment.

                      Fox News reaches settlement with Venezuelan businessman in election defamation case
                  ","
                      Fox News has settled a defamation lawsuit from a Venezuelan businessman who had accused the network of making false claims about him and the 2020 election, attorneys for the man and Fox News said Saturday in a court filing. The details of the settlement were not made public. ""This matter has been resolved amicably by both sides,"" a Fox News spokesperson said Sunday, declining further comment.  Following the 2020 election, former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs had accused the businessman, Majed Khalil, of playing a key role in supposedly rigging the election against Donald Trump. In a tweet calling the 2020 election a ""cyber Pearl Harbor,"" Dobbs named Khalil as one of four people he wanted his audience to ""get familiar with"" for committing supposed election fraud. Fox News still faces a monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which is set to go to trial in just days. Jury selection for the trial begins Thursday and opening statements are scheduled for April 17, unless the two sides reach a settlement before then. Dominion had sued Fox News for defamation, and says it was defamed by the right-wing network when Fox hosts and guests claimed in 2020 that its voting systems illegally rigged the election against Trump. Fox News has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, maintained it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, and argued that Dominion's lawsuit represents a threat to the First Amendment. While Fox's legal liability will be decided at trial, the case has already battered Fox's reputation. Incriminating texts and emails have shown how Fox executives, hosts and producers didn't believe the claims the network was peddling about Dominion.  The lawsuit is seen as one of the most consequential defamation cases in recent memory.  Fox has argued that a loss will eviscerate press freedoms, and many scholars agree that the bar should remain high to prove defamation.  Other analysts have said holding Fox accountable for knowingly airing lies won't pose a threat to objective journalists who would never do that in the first place.

                      Taylor Swift and actor Joe Alwyn have broken up after six years together. A source close to Taylor confirmed the news to CNN saying ""Taylor and Joe broke up a few weeks ago. They simply grew apart and plan to remain friends."" CNN has reached out to Swift and Alwyn's reps for comment. Entertainment Tonight was first to report the news. Swift, who is currently on her ""Eras Tour,"" and Alwyn were first linked romantically in 2016. The Grammy-winner and Alwyn managed to keep their relationship mostly under wraps, but in true Taylor Swift style, the singer dropped some Easter eggs about Alwyn through her music along the way. In January, Swift revealed on her Instagram that ""Lavender Haze,"" a track from her 2022 album ""Midnights,"" is about Alwyn, saying when you're in a lavender haze of love, ""you'll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud."" ""Like my relationship for six years, we've had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff and we just ignore it. This song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff,"" she added. Alwyn also earned a writing credit on ""Midnights"" for the song ""Sweet Nothing."" It's not the first time the couple have collaborated on songs that have appeared on Swift's albums. The British actor was credited on a number of songs from Swift's 2020 pandemic-era albums ""folklore"" and ""evermore"" under the pseudonym ""William Bowery."" Swift confirmed the true identity on the Disney+ documentary ""folklore: the long pond studio sessions"" that same year, where she said Alwyn ""plays piano beautifully and he's always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things."" ""Folklore"" ended up winning a Grammy for album of the year in 2021, marking Alwyn's first Grammy win. There was also speculation in 2019 the then-couple were engaged when Swifties picked up on some bridal-leaning lyrics in ""Lover,"" the title track off the album she released that year. ""If I had a pound for every time I think I've been told I've been engaged, then I'd have a lot of pound coins,"" Alwyn told WSJ Magazine in 2022, coyly adding ""I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn't say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn't say.""

Kenan Thompson played the Jonas Brothers' manager and broke the news to Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman, who played choreographers Gretel and Turbo, that the band is looking for a new, more ""mature"" concept. ""My name is Sally O'Malley. I'm proud to say I'm 50 years old. I'm not one of those girls who's afraid to tell her real age,"" Shannon said, before going into her iconic ""and I like to kick, stretch and kick"" routine. Donning her classic red and white two-piece costume, Shannon continued the routine to recite the character's tagline: ""I'm 50! 50 years old."" Thompson, Yang and Fineman were then visibly seen breaking character to laugh while Shannon hiked up the waistline of her red pants, as Sally O'Malley did when she appeared on ""SNL"" in the past. ""Honey, I've been 50 since before you was born,"" Shannon said when Yang's Turbo questioned her age. The beloved character first debuted in a 1999 sketch where Sally O'Malley attends an open audition for the Rockettes with then-host Danny DeVito. Sally O'Malley was 50 years old then, too. When Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas and Kevin Jonas walked on stage, Nick Jonas said they had a feeling Turbo and Gretel may not understand their new concept. ""So we wanted to show them,"" Joe Jonas said as the three brothers ripped their clothes off to showcase outfits matching Sally O'Malley's. The four of them performed a kick-and-stretch dance routine, but when Nick Jonas flubs a move, he's kicked out of the band and replaced by Sally O'Malley. A graphic of the front page of a newspaper appears on the screen with the headline text reading ""new Jonas Brother is 50-year-old woman!"" Shannon was an ""SNL"" cast member from 1995 to 2001 and is known for her recurring characters like Sally O'Malley and Mary Katherine Gallagher. Saturday's episode was the ""White Lotus"" star's second time hosting the famed sketch show, with the Jonas Brothers returning as the musical guest for the third time.

We were so lucky to have had him in our lives and are thankful for the amazing memories we have."" ""He will be so deeply missed by each and every one of us. We ask that you respect the privacy of his family and of the band at this time."" A statement from his family and the group, obtained by the UK's PA Media news agency, said Friday: ""It is with great sadness that we announce the unexpected passing of our beloved son and brother Paul Cattermole."" ""Paul was found yesterday, 6th April 2023 at his home in Dorset and was pronounced dead later that afternoon."" The cause of death is unknown, but Dorset Police ""confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances,"" the statement added. CNN has contacted S Club 7's representatives. Formed in the late 1990s, pop group S Club 7 had four UK Number 1 singles and a UK chart-topping album. Hits included ""Never Had A Dream Come True,"" ""Bring It All Back,"" ""Don't Stop Movin'"" and ""Have You Ever."" Its members included Rachel Stevens, Jo O'Meara, Tina Barrett, Jon Lee and Bradley McIntosh. The group also had its own television show, originally called ""Miami 7, "" which aired on the BBC.  In 2002, Cattermole said that he was leaving S Club 7 to play with his old band Skua. ""It had got to the point where things were being handled so badly, I had to go,"" he told the Guardian in 2019. S Club -- the group's new name following Cattermole's departure -- eventually split in 2003. ""It was five years of my life,"" Cattermole told the Guardian. ""I definitely thought, when I was 20, that by the time I was 40 it would be a done thing. And it's not ... I've been answering S Club questions for 20 years. It will be great -- it will be bliss -- to one day not have to, but it's part of it, and I totally accept that."" Earlier this year, the pop group announced dates for their 25th anniversary reunion tour in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

                      How a trio of ProPublica reporters landed an explosive story on Justice Clarence Thomas
                  ","
                      It all started with a little curiosity. A team of ProPublica reporters earlier this year began looking into the travel of various Supreme Court justices, not entirely sure what they would find, if anything. But after a little digging, the trio of journalists stumbled upon something that piqued their interest.  In fact, what they uncovered raised their eyebrows to such a degree that they believed the discovery was an explosive story in its own right: a trip that Clarence Thomas had taken aboard billionaire Harlan Crow's private jet between Connecticut and Washington, D.C. But their editors encouraged the team to keep working the story, Justin Elliott, a member of the reporting team, told me by phone on Thursday. ""So we started grinding,"" Elliot explained. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. From there, the story quickly grew in size and scope. ""It snowballed,"" Elliott said. Elliot and his co-authors, Joshua Kaplan and Alex Mierjeski, assembled a spreadsheet comprised of hundreds of people, methodically contacting potential sources as they built the story. ""The progress was gratifyingly steady,"" Elliot told me, cautioning, however, that ""it was not easy."" Easy or not, the final product that published on Thursday morning was unquestionably worth the effort. The bombshell report included stunning details that accuse Thomas of having accepted ultra-luxury vacations and private jet travel from a Republican mega-donor for decades. Even worse? ""These trips appeared nowhere on Thomas' financial disclosures,"" the ProPublica team wrote. ""His failure to report the flights appears to violate a law passed after Watergate that requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to disclose most gifts, two ethics law experts said."" The story landed with a bang, shaking the political world and immediately eliciting statements of serious concern from legal experts and Washington lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said in a statement that the report was ""a call to action."" Durbin added that ""the Senate Judiciary Committee will act."" What ultimately happens remains to be seen. But the immense fallout has already underscored the importance of journalism produced by non-profit newsrooms like ProPublica.  ""From my perspective as a reporter,"" Elliott told me, ""I feel so lucky to have the reporting resources and time resources to do a heavy lift like this. There are not that many places where you can do that anymore. So we are grateful to have jobs at ProPublica. ""If there are any rich people reading,"" Elliott added, ""give your money to nonprofit journalism.""

                      'Ted Lasso' pays tribute to Grant Wahl in new episode
                  ","
                      Longtime soccer journalist Grant Wahl played a significant role in shaping ""Ted Lasso."" In the most recent episode, the show honored his impact. At the end of episode four of Season 3, titled ""Big Week,"" the line ""In memory of Grant Wahl"" appears on the screen as the credits begin to roll. Earlier in the episode, Brendan Hunt, who plays Coach Beard, is seen holding Wahl's book ""The Beckham Experiment,"" analyzing David Beckham's move from Europe to Major League Soccer. Wahl collapsed and died last year while covering the World Cup in Qatar, due to what was later revealed to be a ruptured aortic aneurysm.  Dr. Céline Gounder, Wahl's widow, posted about the episode on Twitter, thanking the ""Ted Lasso"" team for the remembrance. ""This episode means so much to me and my family,"" she wrote.  Hunt, also an executive producer for the show, said Wahl played a huge role in developing the character of Trent Crimm, a journalist who spends Season 3 shadowing the fictional AFC Richmond club for a book he's writing.  Wahl covered the LA Galaxy, the team Beckham joined when he moved to the US, in a similar way -- and they thought of his book immediately to use as an Easter egg in the show, Hunt said in a statement to CNN. ""We exchanged emails about his experience and he was extremely generous with his answers to our questions,"" Hunt said. ""Grant's death happened while we were in post-production, and it was pretty self-evident that we would commemorate him in some way; the episode where his book is shown seemed the most organic place for it ..."" he continued. ""His death remains jarring and tragic. He will forever be missed."" Wahl was a preeminent soccer journalist who spent years covering the sport in the US at a time when soccer was only on the periphery of most Americans' consciousness.  ""He was almost a missionary in that sense,"" British football commentator Jon Champion previously told CNN. ""He would travel around the globe, telling people to take American soccer seriously. If you ask any of the frontline European football journalists who their first port of call has been if they wanted a story in America, it would be Grant Wahl.""  Wahl was also an early fan of ""Ted Lasso,"" interviewing the cast for his podcast in 2020 and visiting Hunt in Richmond last year.  ""Ted Lasso"" has since become a hit for Apple TV+, winning multiple Emmy awards and becoming one of the top shows from the streamer. Just last month, the cast even met with President Joe Biden to discuss mental health.

Shannon has gone on to star in ""Other People,"" ""The White Lotus,"" and ""Divorce,"" among many other roles. But fans of the actress and comedian remember her time at ""SNL"" well. Here are five of Shannon's iconic characters we can't forget.  Mary Katherine Gallagher Shannon's Mary Katherine is a teenage Catholic school girl who swings between hyperactive and shy, but ultimately knows she's a ""superstar."" The time she competes in a sing-off with Whitney Houston is classic. Mary Katherine was the star of the 1999 movie ""Superstar,"" starring Shannon and Will Ferrell. Sally O'Malley Shannon's Sally O'Malley is ""50 years old!"" She can stretch and kick and shimmy and kick again.

Terry Rialto on NPR In ""The Delicious Dish,"" Shannon played a smooth-voiced radio food show host with Ana Gasteyer. The two would innocently use risqué double entendres without realizing they weren't really describing food. Southern Gals Shannon is fantastic as a Southern woman who is visiting New York with her girlfriends. She's thrilled by ""the lady in Times Square"" who brushed her hair then ""squatted down to take a little pee."" She describes seeing ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, but likes the movie better.

                      'The Little Mermaid' remake updates original lyrics to include consent, songwriter says
                  ","
                      The live action remake of ""The Little Mermaid"" will have updated lyrics to include consent, the songwriter has said. The classic Disney movie, originally released as an animation in 1989, has been updated to reflect changing social attitudes towards consent, according to composer Alan Menken, who wrote the soundtrack to the original movie with Howard Ashman. Songs ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" will include new lyrics to reflect this shift. Menken collaborated with American songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda on the live-action remake, which will premiere next month. ""There are some lyric changes in 'Kiss the Girl' because people have gotten very sensitive about the idea that [Prince Eric] would, in any way, force himself on [Ariel],"" Menken said in an interview with Vanity Fair last week. In the movie, Ariel makes a deal with sea witch Ursula to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can explore the world above water and impress Prince Eric. In the animated classic, Ariel must secure the kiss of ""true love"" within three days, or else she transforms back into a mermaid and will belong to Ursula. The song's lyrics urge Prince Eric to kiss Ariel before it's too late.  In the original lyrics to ""Kiss the Girl,"" Sebastian, Ariel's crab pal, sings: ""Yes, you want her. Look at her, you know you do. Possible she wants you, too. There is one way to ask her. It don't take a word. Not a single word. Go on and kiss the girl."" ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" has also been revised, Menken said, because the original contained ""lines that might make young girls somehow feel that they shouldn't speak out of turn, even though Ursula is clearly manipulating Ariel to give up her voice."" ""The men up there don't like a lot of blabber. They think a girl who gossips is a bore,"" sings Ursula in the original track. ""Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word. And after all, what is idle babble for?"" Ursula advises Ariel: ""It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man."" The new lyrics to the songs have not yet been revealed. The remake directed by Rob Marshall and is set to premiere in theaters on May 26. It features Halle Bailey as Ariel, Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric and Javier Bardem as King Triton.

                      Fox asks judge to bar references to January 6 attack at Dominion trial
                  ","
                      Fox asked a judge in court filings made public Thursday to prohibit references to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, as well as threats directed at employees of Dominion Voting Systems, when the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit it faces from the election technology company goes to trial later this month. ""Dominion's defamation claim has nothing to do with the Capitol riot,"" Fox's lawyers argued in the court filings. ""And any reference to the Capitol riot will only unfairly prejudice the jury against Fox, inflame passions, prevent a fair trial, and taint any resulting verdict."" Fox added that threats against Dominion employees ""were horrific and absolutely inexcusable."" But the company said ""allowing Dominion to discuss specific threats and their effect on employees is virtually guaranteed to arouse the jury's sympathy and provoke a desire to punish Fox for the actions of unrelated third parties."" The documents made public Thursday are ""motions in limine,"" which are pretrial efforts by both sides to block certain evidence and arguments from being used during the trial. These motions are common in criminal and civil proceedings. Depending on how the judge rules, the outcome of these motions could significantly shape the trial, potentially giving one side an advantage.  Both Fox and Dominion filed a slew of these pretrial motions last month, but they were under seal. They filed public versions of the documents on Thursday, in accordance with an order from the judge. Media outlets had pressed the judge for more transparency, and to unseal these and other documents. In the documents, Fox additionally asked the judge to bar references to the company's financial information and the state of mind of its employees, arguing both were irrelevant to the case. Dominion strongly disagreed with all of Fox's requests, filing motions of opposition against them. Dominion's lawyers argued that the attack on the U.S. Capitol ""is central to almost every element of this case, and the Court should reject Fox's motion in its entirety."" Dominion also argued that references to threats its employees faced in the aftermath of the 2020 are relevant to the case, contending in court filings that it is ""evidence that Fox's lies destroyed Dominion's reputation and enterprise value."" Dominion's lawyers said that ""people are unlikely to want to work for, contract with, or acquire a business that is besieged by death threats and harassment."" ""It also became incredibly difficult for Dominion to retain and win business because would-be customers themselves are inundated with death threats, harassment, and protests related to Dominion,"" Dominion's lawyers added. The judge said Wednesday that he'll address these motions next week, at an in-person hearing on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware. He might rule on the motions during that hearing, or he could issue written opinions later on. The judge said at a Wednesday hearing related to jury questions that he does not ""see January 6 as relevant in this case,"" perhaps signaling how he could rule on Fox's motion in limine. Dominion, for its part, moved to block Fox News from bringing up emails from one of its top officials who wrote in October 2020 that ""our s**t is just riddled with bugs,"" according to court filings made public Thursday.  Fox News has never argued in court that Dominion rigged the 2020 election, but its lawyers have repeatedly made the point that there are longstanding and bipartisan security concerns about its voting machines. ""Fox's motions attempt to narrow Dominion's kitchen sink legal approach and return focus to the core issues,"" a Fox News spokesperson said in a Thursday statement, ""including documents that show that Dominion's then director of product strategy & security criticized its software by stating 'our s*** is just riddled with bugs' and their CEO saying, 'no customer cares about the media.' Such internal admissions by Dominion directly contradict their case, which is why they continue to push distracting and irrelevant materials in their quest for a payday."" A trial is scheduled to begin April 17, unless the parties reach a last-minute settlement. Fox News has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, maintained it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, and argued that Dominion's lawsuit represents a threat to the First Amendment. While Fox's legal liability will be decided at trial, the case has already battered Fox's reputation. Incriminating texts and emails have shown how Fox executives, hosts and producers didn't believe the claims the network was peddling about Dominion. These revelations drove a dagger through the idea that Fox News is anything but a partisan GOP operation focused on ratings — not journalism. The lawsuit is seen as one of the most consequential defamation cases in recent memory. Fox has argued that a loss will eviscerate press freedoms, and many scholars agree that the bar should remain high to prove defamation. Other analysts have said holding Fox accountable for knowingly airing lies won't pose a threat to objective journalists who would never do that in the first place. The case has elicited a mountain of evidence exposing Fox News as a right-wing profit machine lacking the most basic journalistic ethics — and willing to promote unhinged election conspiracy theories to preserve its lucrative business.

""On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born,"" Rossum posted on her verified Instagram account, noting the child's April 5 birth date. Rossum's post also included snapshots of her son's newborn footprints, her pregnant belly, and a sweet black and white photo of the baby snuggled up in a blanket.  The couple are also parents to a 22-month-old daughter.  The announcement comes as a surprise to the general public. Rossum kept the news secret that she and ""Mr. Robot"" creator Esmail were expecting until Thursday's birth announcement.  What's not a surprise, however, is that Rossum was able to pull off such a feat.  In May 2021, Rossum delivered the news that they had welcomed their daughter on Instagram after never previously sharing that she was pregnant.  The ""Shameless"" star is notoriously private but posted a moving message on Mother's Day last year that included photos of her daughter. ""The first year has been full of playing, crawling, eating, carrying pacifiers in mouths and holding hands. I am so deeply grateful to be your mom,"" her post read.  Esmail directed Rossum in the 2014 romantic comedy ""Comet"" before proposing to her the following year. The couple wed in New York in 2017.

                      Michael K. Williams: Man who sold the late actor fentanyl-laced heroin pleads guilty

                      A Brooklyn man charged in the overdose death of actor and producer Michael K. Williams pleaded guilty Wednesday to drug distribution charges. Irvin Cartagena, who also goes by ""Green Eyes,"" was one of four men charged for being part of a drug trafficking organization that sold deadly fentanyl-laced heroin to Williams. Cartagena pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, heroin and other drugs. Prosecutors allege that Cartagena was the person who conducted the ""the hand-to-hand transaction"" with Williams just before the actor, best known for his role as Omar Little on HBO's ""The Wire,"" died of an accidental overdose. Williams was found dead in his New York City apartment in 2021 in what the New York City Medical Examiner's Officer ruled an accidental overdose. He was 54. ""Irvin Cartagena sold fentanyl-laced heroin in broad daylight in New York City, feeding addiction and causing tragedy,"" the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement Thursday. ""In doing so, he dealt the fatal dose that killed Michael K. Williams."" Cartagena, 39, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison but could face up to 40 years behind bars when he is sentenced by a federal judge. CNN reached out to Cartagena's lawyer for comment.  One of Cartagena's codefendants, Carlos Macci, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute narcotics on Tuesday, according to the court docket. The two other men charged, Hector Robles and Luis Cruz, have pleaded not guilty.

                      Lizzo snuggles Grogu in a cameo-filled 'The Mandalorian'
                  ","
                      Lizzo has officially joined the ""Star Wars"" galaxy far, far away.  The ""About Damn Time"" singer surprised fans when she appeared in the latest episode of ""The Mandalorian"" as a noblewoman who becomes fast friends with young Grogu (Baby Yoda to the uninitiated).  She cameoed alongside Jack Black, who played her daffy husband. Lizzo floated onscreen as Duchess of the Outer Rim planet Plazir-15, and, from what viewers saw, she spends her time sipping on ""secretions"" and playing interstellar bocce with her court. Black as Captain Bombardier was by her side through it all, a former Imperial officer who fell for the Duchess when he was sent to Plazir for ""rehabilitation."" (He swore in the episode he has no Imperial leanings.)  When Mando, fellow Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze and, of course, Grogu enter her ""domed paradise,"" the Duchess and the baby quickly become close companions. The diminutive green creature even uses the Force to help the Duchess outscore her opponents in a lawn game that involved tossing balled-up, centipede-like creatures through a series of hoops.  Later in the episode, Doc Brown himself appears -- Christopher Lloyd of ""Back to the Future"" played the planet's security head Commissioner Helgait, who oversees the reprogrammed battle droids that citizens of Plazir task with carrying shopping bags or valeting ships.  Later, it's revealed that Helgait, a Separatist loyal to the Sith Count Dooku, purposely messed with some of the droids so they'd malfunction. Lizzo's Duchess gravely exiles him on their planet's moon -- and then lovingly knights Grogu for being his sweet self.  Lizzo is an avowed fan of Grogu -- in 2021, she painted herself green and donned a beige robe and pointy ears to portray the young Force-sensitive alien for Halloween.  Sharing images of herself traipsing around Hollywood in costume, Lizzo facetiously wrote on Instagram: ""A representative from Grogu's publicity team has issued a statement regarding the paparazzi photos taken last night: 'Grogu aka Baby Yoda aka The Child has no recollection of these events. In fact, these events never happened *jedi hand wave*'""  The Emmy and Grammy winner celebrated her appearance on ""The Mandalorian"" with a selfie, flanked by countless Grogu stuffed animals and figurines: ""I'm in Star Wars YALL!""

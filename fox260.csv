Trump takes heat from right for saying he didn't 'hit' Newsom because Calif gov said nice things about him,"Former President Donald Trump is receiving criticism from some on the right in the wake of comments he made in which he said he ""could never hit"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom because the liberal Democrat was ""so nice to me.""

""You have a very ambitious guy in California, but he’s done a terrible job with the state,"" Trump, who is also a 2024 presidential candidate, said in an interview on Fox News’ ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" ""I used to get along great with him when I was president. Got along really good ... Gavin.""

""You got along with Gavin Newsom?"" Carlson asked.

""I did. I really did. He was always very nice to me, said the greatest things. He would say things like, ‘He's doing a great job.’""

""About you?"" Carlson said.

""About me, that's why I could never hit him because he was so nice to me, just laying in wait right?"" Trump said. ""But he was very nice to me, relatively speaking.""

The remarks brought pushback from some on the right who bristled at the suggestion that Trump had pulled his punches against one of the most significant left-wing politicians in the country.

""I’m really disappointed in Trump over his kissing up to Gavin Newsom,"" commentator Kurt Schlichter said. ""This leftist monster is A-OK because he’s been nice to Trump? Conservative @GovRonDeSantis is awful because he has not been nice lately?""

TRUMP TELLS TUCKER HE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT BIDEN SEEKING REELECTION: 'SOMETHING WRONG'

""What the hell? Has Trump learned nothing at all?"" he said.

""Gavin Newsom has pushed some of the most radical policies in the US, including hundreds of billions in reparations,"" Chronicles Magazine editor Pedro Gonzalez tweeted. ""And Trump just said he could never ‘hit him’ because Newsom was ‘so nice to me.’ Trump can’t fight the left because he identifies more with the left than not.""

""This interview summed it up perfectly,"" John Cardillo said. ""All anyone has to do is flatter Trump and they can get away with whatever they want.""

Trump allies pushed back against the criticism and accused some outlets of cutting out the part where Trump said Newsom had done a terrible job, implying the criticism was an underhand move by supporters of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom many expect to enter the 2024 presidential primary race against Trump.

Arrest of classified documents leak suspect Jack Teixeira met with outrage,"The arrest of a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman in connection to classified documents that have been leaked online in recent months has been met with outrage as critics wonder how a young man could have such high-level access to national security information.

FBI agents arrested Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Douglas Teixeira on Thursday after U. S. intelligence documents that had critical information about the war in Ukraine and Chinese relations were posted on the chat app Discord. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Teixeira is being investigated for the ""alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.""

""It is treason,"" former Bush 43 chief speechwriter Marc Thiessen told ""The Story"" on Thursday, ""The idea that a 21-year-old kid can expose sources and methods of how we spy, how we have penetrated the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, because apparently we've exposed the fact we know they have a new hypersonic missile that can reach the United States, that they exposed our penetration of the Russian Defense Ministry, that could affect the war in Ukraine. I mean, the incompetence is stunning.""

""And it wasn't, unlike Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, it wasn't ideological,"" he continued. ""It was some kid trying to show off to his friends in a gaming chat room and has literally affected global national security by doing so. How this happens is just beyond me.""

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S. C., told ""America Reports"" the leak is a ""massive, catastrophic occurrence that should never have happened.""

""We're talking about imperiling likely American lives,"" he explained. ""We're talking about weakening our relationship with our allies, emboldening the strength of our adversaries and revealing plans about attacks and coordination for Ukraine and other allies.""

Anheuser-Busch sheds roughly $5 billion in value since Bud Light’s Dylan Mulvaney pact sparked outrage,"Beer juggernaut Anheuser-Busch has seen its value nosedive roughly $5 billion since Bud Light’s polarizing partnership with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney.

As of Wednesday's close, Anheuser-Busch has fallen 5.02% and lost $4.562 billion in market cap, according to Dow Jones Market Data Group.

The stock was $66.73 per share on March 31 and closed at $63.38 on Wednesday.

An analysis on the matter was first published in the New York Post.

Mulvaney, a trans activist and social media influencer who gained prominence when given an opportunity to interview President Biden about LGBTQ issues in 2022, revealed earlier this month that the beer company sent packs of Bud Light with her face printed on the cans as part of an ad for the beer company’s March Madness contest and as a way to celebrate a full year of ""girlhood.""

Mulvaney said the cans were her ""most prized possession"" on Instagram with a post featuring ""#budlightpartner."" A video then featured Mulvaney in a bathtub drinking a Bud Light beer as part of the campaign, but the pact was met with significant criticism.

Anheuser-Busch stock plummeting comes as country music singer John Rich said he pulled cases of Bud Light from his Nashville, Tennessee, bar as part of a boycott against Anheuser-Busch; conservative rocker Kid Rock used several Bud Light cases for target practice in a viral video; and there has been widespread backlash on social media while beer distributors are concerned.

Anheuser-Busch did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its stock. The company had previously stood by the decision.

""Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics. From time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public,"" an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson told Fox News.

Beer Business Daily editor and publisher Harry Schuhmacher wrote earlier this week that Anheuser-Busch distributors in rural areas are ""spooked"" over the backlash.

""This is probably the biggest controversy we've seen in a long time,"" Schuhmacher told Fox News Digital. ""There was a little bit of worry, especially in the South and the Midwest and especially in rural areas where retailers were reporting the, you know, their customers weren't happy with Bud Light and some retailers themselves weren't happy with Bud Light.""

GOP presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy scolded Bud Light on Wednesday in an opinion piece for Fox News Digital.

""Now the King of Beers is paying homage to the newest cultural zeitgeist by paying trans activist Dylan Mulvaney to prod grown men into dressing like Audrey Hepburn while drinking beer. For a drink that was once a blue-collar staple of middle America, this isn’t a winning sales strategy. It’s a way for the CEO to signal his virtue while alienating a customer base that is too afraid to say so out loud,"" Ramaswamy wrote.

FBI arrests Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira in probe of classified document leaks,"FBI agents arrested Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Douglas Teixeira at a home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, on Thursday in connection with a trove of classified documents that have been leaked online in recent months.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Teixeira, 21, is being investigated for the ""alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.""

Teixeira, who joined the Air National Guard in September 2019, held the highest-level security clearance granted by the federal government for top secret information, according to an internal Department of Defense email reviewed by Fox News.

His security clearance and access to classified government systems have since been revoked, according to another internal government document.

WHO IS JACK TEIXEIRA, THE AIR NATIONAL GUARDSMEN ALLEGEDLY BEHIND LEAKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

Teixeira was most recently stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base as a member of the of 102nd Intelligence Wing. He was promoted to Airman 1st Class last July, according to the unit.

The FBI began surveilling Teixeira in connection with the leaks before Thursday, but were forced to accelerate their plans to arrest him after the New York Times identified him on Thursday morning, a source briefed on the investigation told Fox News.

That New York Times report named Teixeira as the leader of a Discord group called ""Thug Shaker Central"" that consisted of roughly 20 to 30 young men.

Teixeira allegedly starting sharing classified documents with the private group in recent months, but the leaks gained wider attention after another member shared them in a public forum, according to the report.

Investigators don't believe that the case ends with Teixeira and are looking at other who may be involved, a source told Fox News.

The National Guard said in a statement it is aware of the ""alleged role a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman may have played in the recent leak of highly-classified documents"" from the Pentagon.

PENTAGON DOCUMENT LEAK HAS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY: SUCKS UP ‘A LOT OF OXYGEN’

""The National Guard takes this issue very seriously and will support investigators,"" the National Guard said in a statement. ""National security is our foremost priority and any attempt to undermine it compromises our values and degrades trust among our members, the public, allies and partners.""

Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder called the leaks a ""a deliberate criminal act,"" saying that distribution lists for classified information are being reviewed.

LEAKER OF CLASSIFIED US INTELLIGENCE WORKS ON MILITARY BASE, POSTED THE DOCUMENTS ON DISCORD: REPORT

""We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age,"" Ryder said at a press conference on Thursday.

""You've received training and you will receive an understanding of the rules and requirements that come along with those responsibilities, and you're expected to abide by those rules, regulations and responsibility. It's called military discipline. And in certain cases, especially when it comes to sensitive information, it also is about the law.""

Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks sent a memo to Pentagon officials on Tuesday, warning employees against leaking classified information or downloading classified documents from unclassified sources.

""Do not access or download documents with classified markings from unclassified websites – either from home or work – as the data may be classified, it may be associated with hostile foreign elements, or it may contain malicious code or embedded capability that could introduce cyber threats into our information system,"" Hicks wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Fox News.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also ordered a review on Thursday of ""intelligence access, accountability and control procedures"" to ensure that leaks like this don't happen again.

A large police presence could be seen on Thursday in Teixeira's quiet neighborhood in North Dighton, a small town about 35 miles south of Boston.

""This is where I live, so it's crazy to see all this going on here,"" a member of the community told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

""I don't know the parents, but I know of [Teixeira] because of my son - they rode the [school] bus together. They've lived there a long time and obviously as a parent I feel horrible for them.""

President Biden said earlier Thursday that the U. S. was ""getting close"" to finding the person responsible for leaking Pentagon documents that the Department of Defense has described as containing ""sensitive and highly-classified material.""

""I can’t right now [give an update]. There is a full-blown investigation going on with the intelligence community and Justice Department and they are getting close,"" Biden told reporters during his trip to Ireland. ""I don’t have an answer for you.""

The president also said, ""I’m concerned that it happened, but there is nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.""

The leaked documents mainly concern Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but also include intelligence on China, the Middle East, Israel's spy agency Mossad, and world leaders.

U. S. defense officials previously told Fox News that this leak could be ""bigger than Snowden"" in terms of damage to intelligence and allied relationships.

Teixeira is expected to make his first court appearance some time on Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., a source with the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts said.

Bud Light's woke marketing exec roasted as company loses billions after partnership with trans influencer,"Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen argued Thursday the push for diversity, equity, and inclusion within companies is ""corrosive"" after Anheuser-Busch reportedly lost billions in the wake of its partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

The beer giant has reportedly seen its market value decrease by $5 billion in recent weeks. Budweiser Marketing Vice President Alissa Heinerscheid said the goal was to ""evolve and elevate"" the brand.

""She’s a beer salesman,"" Thiessen countered. ""The job of a marketing manager at Budweiser is to sell Budweiser.""

Thiessen argued on ""Outnumbered"" the main question in a Budweiser marketing meeting should be, ""Is this going to sell more beer or is this going to hurt our beer sales?""

TRANS WOMAN AND NEW BUD LIGHT PARTNER DYLAN MULVANEY NOW PAID BY NIKE TO MODEL SPORTS BRAS

He then speculated no one raised that important question when discussing a possible partnership with a transgender influencer for fear of being labeled ""transphobic"" or creating a hostile work environment.

Thiessen noted that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) management is the second fastest-growing job in America, according to LinkedIn.

""That means that every major company in America is hiring a political commissar whose job is to promote inclusivity and push down the people who would say, ‘this might be a dumb idea,’"" he explained.

Thiessen told panelists many young people are taking DEI management roles because they want to do social justice work while making a corporate salary.

""They don't want social justice organization salaries,"" he said. ""Quit your job, take a pay cut and go work for social justice if that's what you want. Otherwise, sell beer.""

""Outnumbered"" co-host Kayleigh McEnany said she’s ""befuddled"" by this trend that is being seen in all industries from beer to sports, and even Disney.

Disney’s job, she said, is to make movies.

""But then they venture into this territory of trying to change kids’ minds. Like Disney+ putting out something denouncing Abraham Lincoln, talking about White fragility,"" McEnany said. ""Well, they lost 2.4 million subscribers. This is the consequence of getting into that territory.""

Co-host Emily Compagno echoed Thiessen’s opinion that the widespread emphasis on DEI is ""corrosive.""

""Unfortunately, it's not just the corporate sector. It's riddling our government, too,"" she said.

Young couple's shocking story of being nearly $1 million in debt goes viral,"A video depicting a young woman calling into financial adviser Dave Ramsey’s radio show asking for help trying to pay off her and her husband's near $1 million in debt went viral on Twitter this week.

The video, recently posted to Ramsey’s TikTok, captured the 2018 exchange between a 29-year-old woman and the adviser, during which she asked him how to get rid of the couple's huge debt ""without filing bankruptcy.""

The woman indicated that the majority of their massive debt was from personal credit card bills and student loans. She mentioned that both of them had advanced degrees, for which they owe more than a third of their total debt.

SUPREME COURT REVIEWS STUDENT LOAN DEBT HANDOUT PLAN: HOW IT MAY IMPACT YOU

A version of the shocking video shared to Twitter was viewed over nine million times in two days.

The video began with the young woman over the phone telling Ramsey, ""We have probably just under $1 million in debt and we wanna know how to get debt free without filing bankruptcy.""

Ramsey’s first question was ""How much of that is a mortgage?"" to which she replied that only $210,000 of that goes to payments on the couple’s house.

Appearing slightly perplexed, Ramsey followed up by inquiring, ""So you have $600,000 in what?"" The guest said, ""$335,000 is in student loans — we both have advanced degrees — and then the rest is really credit cards and student loans.""

Ramsey, looking visibly concerned, then asked, ""How old are you all?"" After the woman mentioned she was 29, he flat out asked, ""So, what in the world?""

Further, conveying how large this amount of debt is, he added, ""I mean, are you both on this, or is this just one of you that has completely lost your mind?"" The guest claimed that her husband, who is 32 years old, has the majority of credit card loans and that she has the majority of student loan debt.

Elsewhere in the video, Ramsey asked what kind of advanced degrees they both have, to which she said, ""He has an MBA and I have an advanced degree in policy."" She indicated that both of them work for the government, as the exasperated adviser held his hand to his head and let out a massive sigh.

Ramsey then asked their household income, which she disclosed was ""about $230,000."" He asked, ""Is there recognition on both your parts how absurd this situation is?"" She affirmed that to be the case, which Ramsey claimed was ""good.""

In a second clip of the exchange, Ramsey provided the couple some tough truth. ""Well, you’re scared, and you should be,"" he said, adding, ""you’re disgusted and you should be. You’re in the early stages of being sick and tired of being sick and tired and you should be.""

He continued, saying, ""So I’m getting ready to destroy your life as you know it, because your lifestyle is considerably above your extremely good income and has been for a period of time, and so you’ve gotten used to spending like you’re in Congress.""

He then advised, ""You’re gonna have to not care what anyone thinks, including each other, because you’re not gonna spend any money on anything ever for the next three years.""

"Texas man who spit at police sees 'life of crime' crumble, slapped with 70 years in prison to 'send a message'","A Texas man convicted of spitting at Lubbock police officers back in May 2022 was sentenced to 70 years in prison on Wednesday, according to reports

KLBK-TV in Lubbock, Texas, reported that police arrested 36-year-old Larry Pearson in May 2022 for domestic violence.

Prosecuting attorney Jessica Gorman told the station Pearson was arrested after the victim flagged down a Lubbock Police Department officer.

Pearson’s charges were based on allegations that he hit a woman multiple times in the face and left here with visible injuries.

After Pearson was arrested and placed in a patrol vehicle, the station reported, he got angry because the victim was not arrested, then began kicking the door of the cruiser.

When the officers opened the door and told Pearson to stop, he spat at them and continued to do so after he arrived at the Lubbock County Detention Center.

Pearson was ultimately found guilty by a jury of two counts of harassment of a public servant.

Gorman, who did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital regarding the sentencing, asked the jury to ""send a message"" to Pearson and society when considering a number to attach to the sentence.

The prosecutor said the minimum Pearson would face was 25 years in prison because he had been convicted previously of aggravated robbery and family violence.

Pearson’s attorney, Jim Shaw, told jurors the sentencing was for a ""simple misdemeanor"" that had gotten out of control.

As it turned out, the jury slapped Pearson with a 70-year sentence.

Gorman told KLBK-TV that a 70-year sentence would not be handed down to someone for something like this if they have never been in trouble with the law before.

Parkinson's researchers discover disease biomarker in key breakthrough,"An international group of researchers has discovered a new tool that can reveal a key pathology of Parkinson's disease in brain and body cells.

The identification of the new biomarker, known as abnormal alpha-synuclein, opens a new chapter for research, according to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.

The foundation led the coalition and its landmark clinical study, Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

The findings were published Wednesday in the scientific journal The Lancet Neurology.

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN, 54, REVEALS PARKINSON'S DIAGNOSIS, SAYS 'DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME'

The tool, also known as the α-synuclein seeding amplification assay, is able to detect pathology in spinal fluid both for those diagnosed with the disease and individuals who are at high risk of developing it but have not yet been diagnosed or exhibited clinical symptoms.

The laboratory testing can confirm the presence of abnormal alpha-synuclein, which is detected in most people who have Parkinson's with what the foundation said was ""astonishing accuracy.""

Of those who participated in the testing, 93% were proven to have abnormal alpha-synuclein.

""We've never previously been able to see in a living person whether they have this alpha-synuclein biological change happening in their body,"" Dr. Todd Sherer, chief mission officer at The Michael J. Fox Foundation, said in a statement.

A protein normally found in the nervous system, alpha-synuclein — like amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease — can start to misfold and clump, damaging neurons and causing Parkinson’s disease to develop.

It has previously been possible to confirm the presence of the clumps solely through postmortem analysis. If abnormal alpha-synuclein is present in a spinal fluid sample, clumps form and the dye the sample is prepared with lights up.

The foundation notes the new tool ""takes advantage of a telling characteristic of alpha-synuclein that is pathologic,"" causing nearby, normal alpha-synuclein to misfold and clump.

The scientists tested some 1,123 samples of spinal fluid, showing the test was abnormal in fewer than 5% of people without Parkinson's.

The foundation said there is ""tremendous promise in optimizing"" the assay to measure the amount of alpha-synuclein present.

""I’m moved, humbled and blown away by this breakthrough, which is already transforming research and care, with enormous opportunity to grow from here,"" foundation co-founder Michael J. Fox said. ""I’m so grateful for the support of patients, families and researchers who are in it with us as we continue to kick down doors on the path to eradicating Parkinson’s once and for all.""

Optimized assays would also detect abnormal synuclein through a blood draw or nasal swab.

California reparations panel says total cost 'least important' aspect despite potential $800B price tag,"A member of California's reparations task force is dismissing the total dollar amount as the ""least important piece"" of their proposal, despite the committee considering doling out nearly triple the state's existing budget in payments to Black residents as a way to make amends for slavery and subsequent discrimination.

""We want to make sure that this is presented out in a way that does not reinforce the preoccupation with a dollar figure, which is the least important piece of this,"" Cheryl Grills, a clinical psychologist and member of the California Reparations Task Force, told CalMatters in a new interview.

""It's important,"" continued Grills, ""but it's the least important in terms of being able to get to a point in our country's history and in California's history where we recognize that the harm cuts across multiple areas and domains and that the repair needs to align with that.""

Last month, economists predicted in a preliminary estimate that California's reparations plan could cost the state over $800 billion. The task force, which consulted five economists and policy experts to arrive at the number, clarified that the total does not include compensations for property the group says was taken unjustly, or for the devaluation of Black-owned businesses. California's total annual budget currently sits at roughly $300 billion.

The task force had previously been considering a proposal to give just under $360,000 per person to approximately 1.8 million Black Californians who had an ancestor enslaved in the U. S., putting the total cost of the program at about $640 billion.

It's unclear how California would pay for large-scale reparations. Newsom announced in January that the state faces a projected budget deficit of $22.5 billion for the coming fiscal year. Then weeks later, the California Legislative Analyst's Office, a government agency that analyzes the budget for the state legislature, estimated in a subsequent report that Newsom's forecast undershot the mark by about $7 billion.

Still, Grills chided the media for covering California's reparations proposals by focusing on the dollar amount.

""It's really unfortunate. I'm actually sad to see that our news media is not able to nuance better,"" she said. ""It's almost like, 'What's going to be sensational' as opposed to what's important.""

A final report with the panel's official recommendations is due by July 1 to the California Legislature, which will then decide whether to implement the measures and send them to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.

Newsom, a Democrat, signed a bill creating the task force amid the unrest following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He appointed the majority of the panel's nine members, one of whom are White.

Another task force member, Lisa Holder, president of the far-left Equal Justice Society, vowed in a recent opinion piece that the committee's ""recommendations will be breathtaking.""

According to California Justice Department officials, the law creating the task force did not instruct the committee to identify funding sources.

NEWSOM FALLS SILENT AFTER CALLS FOR HIM TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION ON REPARATIONS

""The task force is required by AB 3121 to recommend to the legislature methods for calculating reparations and the scope of reparations,"" Senior Assistant Attorney General Michael Newman previously told CalMatters. ""Based on their recommendations, the legislature is ultimately tasked with implementing these changes into law and figuring out how to pay for it.""

More recently, the panel's chair, Kamilah Moore, said last month it's up to the state legislature to determine a restitution amount based on the methodology economists recommended.

""The task force is pretty much done regarding the compensation component,"" she told KCRA. ""Our task was to create a methodology for calculation for various forms of compensation that correspond with our findings.""

MEET SOME OF THE CONTROVERSIAL INDIVIDUALS BEHIND SAN FRANCISCO'S $5M REPARATIONS PUSH: 'AMERICA, YOU OWE US'

At a recent in-person meeting of the task force, activists demanded California pay millions of dollars per Black resident in reparations, dismissing the idea of payments of $5 million per person as ""nothing"" and ""too little.""

The $5 million figure appeared to come from the city of San Francisco, which is currently weighing its own reparations proposals at the local level to pay that amount to qualifying Black residents.

Beyond the money, proponents of reparations are also seeking a range of other measures, including an apology letter from the state of California for past discrimination.

Missouri theme park implements new rule after massive brawl erupts involving more than 150 teens,"An amusement park in Missouri established a chaperone policy after a fight involving 100 to 150 teenagers broke out over the weekend, requiring law enforcement to help break it up.

The Clay County Sheriff's Office said in a press release that the teenagers were involved in a fight at the Worlds of Fun amusement park in Kansas City, Missouri, on Saturday.

In a Wednesday announcement, Worlds of Fun announced it would be implementing a chaperone policy, requiring all people ages 15 or younger must be with a person who is at least 21 in order to ""be admitted to, or remain in, the park after 4:00 p.m.""

""For decades, Worlds of Fun has been a place where families and friends come together to enjoy our one-of-a-kind park. Millions of guests have counted on us for their daily dose of wholesome family fun, and we’re committed to keeping that promise going forward,"" a statement along with the policy states.

The new chaperone policy will go into effect on Saturday.

Off-duty deputies and park security officers worked with the Kansas City Police Department worked to move the teenagers out of the park.

One teenage girl refused to leave the park and punched a deputy in the face, leaving the law enforcement official with ""superficial injuries,"" according to the press release.

Who is Nima Momeni? Suspect in Bob Lee stabbing in San Francisco,"California police have arrested a self-described tech entrepreneur in connection with the stabbing death of Silicon Valley mogul Bob Lee, the founder of Cash App and an executive at Square and MobileCoin who was killed last week.

San Francisco jail records show that Nima Momeni, 38, was booked around 9:20 a.m. Thursday on a charge of first-degree murder. District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she had also filed a special circumstance allegation that the crime had been committed with a knife.

A LinkedIn profile in Momeni's name identifies the IT professional as the owner of an outsourcing firm called Expand-IT.

Momeni lived in Emeryville, on the other end of the Bay Bridge from where San Francisco police found Lee bleeding from stab wounds after 2:30 a.m. on April 4.

Momeni attended the University of California, Berkeley, and has also worked as a consultant and network engineer, according to the profile.

""We can confirm that Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni knew each other; however, we will not be able to provide further details at this time regarding the evidence,"" San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said during a Thursday afternoon news briefing.

He said police served two search warrants in San Francisco and another in Emeryville, where they arrested Momeni at his home, on the mainland side of San Francisco's Bay Bridge, across the bay from where Lee was seen on shocking surveillance video stumbling and cradling his wounded side before police arrived last week.

When pressed on crime in the city, Scott blamed human nature and not geography for the crime.

""This has nothing to do with San Francisco,"" he said. ""This has to do with human nature.""

CASH APP FOUNDER BOB LEE DIED PLEADING WITH 911 FOR HELP: REPORT

""We followed the evidence, and there was a lot of evidence,"" Scott said, but he declined to go into specifics, citing the ongoing investigation.

Expand-IT's website reveals few details about its business and does not have a roster of its leadership or contain information about its founding.

""We specialize in providing technical support and fulfillment solutions at scale to startups, SMEs, public sector, and nonprofit organizations,"" a description of its work reads. ""Our approach is designed to deliver the power of a fully staffed and experienced IT department at a fraction of the cost of managing it in-house.""

Lee's ex-wife, Krista Lee, with whom he shares two children, told Fox News on Thursday that she had received a call from authorities who told her they had arrested Momeni, a man whom she had not met.

Republicans have made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in recent years. In 2020, Trump increased his share of the Black vote from 6 to 8 percent compared to 2016. Similarly, Trump increased his share of the Hispanic vote from 28 percent to 35 percent.

Bud Light sponsors NFL Draft as beer brand faces backlash over Dylan Mulvaney partnership,"The NFL Draft's main sponsor has been Bud Light, but the spotlight on the beer brand has never been hotter as it has caught flak over its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney.

Mulvaney is a transgender influencer who also scored a deal with Nike.

The Bud Light partnership has garnered tons of publicity toward the beer juggernaut, but it has hurt its pockets – according to Dow Jones Market Data Group, Anheuser-Busch has fallen 5.02% and lost $4.562 billion in market cap.

Anheuser-Busch and the NFL renewed their partnership in 2021, making Bud Light the official beer of the NFL. The deal runs through the 2026-2027 season, according to Sportico.

Country music singer John Rich said he pulled cases of Bud Light from his Nashville bar as part of a boycott.

""The customers decide. Customers are king,"" Rich said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight."" ""I own a bar in downtown Nashville. Our No. 1 selling beer up until a few days ago was what? Bud Light. We got cases and cases and cases of it sitting back there. But in the past several days, you’re hard-pressed to find anyone ordering one. So, as a business owner, I go, ‘Hey if you aren’t ordering it, we got to put something else in here.’ At the end of the day, that’s capitalism. That’s how it works.""

Mulvaney gained prominence when given an opportunity to interview President Joe Biden about LGBTQ issues in 2022. Mulvaney revealed earlier this month that the beer company sent packs of Bud Light with her face printed on the cans as part of an ad for the beer company’s March Madness contest and as a way to celebrate a full year of ""girlhood.""

When Mulvaney partnered up with Nike, Caitlyn Jenner voiced her displeasure against the ""woke"" company.

""As someone that grew up in awe of what Phil Knight did, it is a shame to see such an iconic American company go so woke!

New Jersey shore town offers boardwalk in shape of the cross despite criticism,"A New Jersey beach town is making a grand gesture to start this summer in good faith.

Ocean Grove, New Jersey — known for its Christian roots and values — has rebuilt its massive oceanfront pier in the shape of a cross.

The boardwalk was destroyed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 — and its new design is now set to be revealed at a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Saturday, April 15.

Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association president Michael Badger said in an interview with Fox News Digital that the symbolic design was not intentional, but ""organic.""

ON GOOD FRIDAY YEARS AGO, NYC SKYSCRAPERS LIT UP WITH CROSSES AND SHOWED A NATION THAT EMBRACED FAITH

Badger, who has a background in engineering, said he and his team aimed to build the ""best pier"" possible.

""The more we thought about it [and] prayed about it, [the more] the inspiration came for the present design,"" he said.

""We're always going to be welcoming and seeking for people to be engaged by the gospel – and that's what we have to offer.""

The thought behind the design was to add ""more ends"" to the pier, which resulted in the shape of a cross, Badger said.

JERSEY SHORE CHRISTIAN FESTIVAL GEARS UP TO SHARE GOSPEL MESSAGE WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THIS SUMMER

""It's functional,"" he continued. ""But it became obvious to us that it is in the shape of a cross — and how fitting it is for our Christian mission.""

He added, ""So this is just a culminating of a design process that sought to create an optimal pier — and we do see the blessing of God's hand in this.""

Construction on the pier began in Sept. 2022. It stretches nearly 500 feet long and 24 feet wide across the extended arms.

The $2 million project was 100% donor-funded, according to Badger.

The stormproof pier will be completely open to the public for visitors to fish, relax and enjoy nature.

""It is fabulous,"" Badger said. ""People are going to love it.""

The build did not come without scrutiny, Badger said. Some people were quick to criticize the pier’s Christian symbolism.

The cross should still be a ""part of the American fabric,"" as Americans are free to exercise religion ""even in public spaces.""

""There are some people who feel that, in this day and age, Christians should take the crosses and move them inside their buildings and close the doors,"" he said.

""And that's not a sentiment that we agree [with].""

""Christianity is a global faith ... We're always going to be welcoming and seeking for people to be engaged by the gospel — and that's what we have to offer.""

The cross should still be a ""part of the American fabric,"" as Americans are free to exercise religion ""even in public spaces,"" Badger also said.

""We can’t hide our faith,"" he continued. ""It's something we live out day to day, and I would be concerned if there ever came a day when that wasn't allowed.""

Badger continued, ""Anyone is allowed out on the pier, and we would celebrate them going out.""

Despite some backlash, most of the feedback about the pier has been positive, he said; most Ocean Grovers are just happy to have a boardwalk back on the beach.

""People are celebrating being whole again and better than we've ever been,"" he said. ""This is the best pier that Ocean Grove’s ever had.""

Badger added that there’s been a lot of ""optimism"" about the pier and its inclusive nature — which allows anyone to walk out onto the water.

IMPORTANCE OF TRADITIONAL AMERICAN VALUES HAS PLUMMETED ACROSS US, POLL SHOWS

""I'm hoping that people find peace there. I'm hoping they find joy,"" he said. ""I'm hoping they're able to communicate with others and can feel a part of the community.""

""This isn't political; this is spiritual. And for Ocean Grove, it's historical.""

Badger volunteers in his role as OGCMA president.

He is responsible for managing Ocean Grove’s beach, boardwalk, historic buildings and religious and secular programming.

The association owns all the land in the 153-year-old beach town, which was founded after the Civil War.

""It was a time when America had been divided,"" Badger said. ""They were broken physically, emotionally. Family members had fought against family members. Churches were splitting.""

I'M A CHRISTIAN AND I'M SUING MY STATE BECAUSE IT REFUSED TO LET ME ADOPT CHILDREN

People sought out Ocean Grove as a place for ""healing and restoration,"" he noted.

It's a place, he said, ""for people to go beside nature and to be in communion with God and to heal.""

Ocean Grove continues to maintain that same mission by creating a location for ""holy leisure,"" Badger added.

""We see that as what God's mission for us to do is to create opportunities for spiritual birth growth and renewal, and that's done through educational, recreational worship and similar means,"" he said.

Colts Neck Community Church Pastor Chris Durkin expressed his support for Ocean Grove's mission in an interview with Fox News Digital, calling it a community that is ""very near to our hearts.""

While Ocean Grove has been nicknamed ""God's square mile,"" Durkin said the new pier is a ""wonderful addition to the Jersey shore.""

The pastor said he believes it's important to continue representing the ""viewpoints of Christians"" as a nation that has ""not shied away from the cross.""

""The cross is the most celebrated symbol across the world,"" he said. ""So putting a cross along the Jersey Shore reminds us of the hope that Jesus Christ gives to all who believe.""

Pennsylvania woman allegedly strangled 11-year-old son to death over 'financial difficulties',"The Pennsylvania woman accused of killing her 11-year-old son allegedly told detectives that she strangled her child to death because of the family's financial situation, an affidavit reveals.

The Horsham Township Police Department responded to a residence on Tuesday after the boy's father called 911 and said that the 11-year-old was unresponsive, adding that he believed his wife, Ruth Dirienzo-Whitehead, 50, killed him.

During an interview with police, the husband said that he slept in another room on Monday night and when he woke up, he noticed that the master bedroom door, where his wife and son slept, was locked. Additionally, he told officers that his wife's black Toyota Highlander was missing from their garage. The father told detectives that it wasn't unusual for him to sleep in a different room than with his wife.

The father forced entry into the bedroom and found his 11-year-old son dead.

PENNSYLVANIA WOMAN ALLEGEDLY KILLED YOUNG SON IN HIS SLEEP, THEN FLED TO NEW JERSEY AND DROVE CAR INTO OCEAN

A Montgomery County Detective said that the 11-year-old had ""ligature marks"" on the front and rear side of his neck, in addition to swelling to the face and ""obvious petechia to his eyes."" The detective said that these are all ""consistent with strangulation,"" according to an affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital.

Another detective observed that the child had ""blood and fluids draining from his mouth and nose.""

While law enforcement was still on the scene in Horsham, Pennsylvania, the police department received a call from the Cape May, New Jersey Prosecutors Office, explaining that police had found Dirienzo-Whitehead's car submerged in the ocean just off of Beach Avenue on Tuesday.

Dirienzo-Whitehead wasn't located with the Toyota Highlander, but was taken into custody in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey, shortly after.

In an interview with detectives, Dirienzo-Whitehead said that she and her 11-year-old son went to bed in the master bedroom at 9:30 p.m. on Monday. She said that her son had been ""upset and crying off and on all day over the family's financial difficulties,"" according to the probable cause affidavit.

The mother told officials during the interview that she strangled her son to death while he was sleeping.

Dirienzo-Whitehead said in the interview with detectives that she ""did not want Matthew to grow up with these struggles"" which is why she ""strangled him with her husband's belt as he slept,"" the affidavit said, paraphrasing the mother.

After allegedly killing her son, Dirienzo-Whitehead ""drove her vehicle onto The Cove Beach and into the ocean,"" the affidavit states.

When the car was no longer operable, Dirienzo-Whitehead walked to Wildwood Crest and was found by the Wildwood Crest Police Department, officials said.

Police found a black men's dress belt on the front driver's side floor of the vehicle when the Toyota Highland water was found in the ocean.

'Friday Night Lights' star Minka Kelly details shocking childhood,"Minka Kelly is revealing details of her ""chaotic"" and ""unstable"" childhood — raised by an exotic dancer — in a shocking, upcoming memoir.

The actress, now 42, shares stories of her mother, ""Mo,"" taking her to strip clubs as a child, physical abuse and getting pregnant at 17. The memoir, ""Tell Me Everything,"" is set to be published May 2.

""My childhood was colorful and chaotic, unstable and inconsistent, unpredictable and hard a lot of the times,"" Kelly told People magazine. ""But the silver lining is that it made me a very adaptable person.""

The actress grew up in poverty and often unsupervised as her mother worked as an exotic dancer to make ends meet. Mo would sometimes take the young child with her to the Crazy Girls strip club in Los Angeles, and they'd go grocery shopping at 2 a.m. afterward if Mo made enough money, according to People.

‘EUPHORIA’ STAR MINKA KELLY, LIKE SYDNEY SWEENEY, PUSHED BACK AGAINST NUDE SCENES: ‘WE CAN KEEP MY DRESS ON’

At the age of 17, Kelly performed in peep shows at an adult video store in New Mexico — to make ends meet while her mother wasn't around, the outlet reported.

""I started with the scariest part,"" Kelly told People of her decision to write about the peep show in first part of the memoir. ""The part that I carried the most shame about, the part that I felt the most embarrassed of, the part that I hid my whole life, and the part that I've had people make me feel bad about. And I felt like that was just where I had to be the most brave.""

Kelly also found out she was pregnant at the age of 17 with her high-school boyfriend, Rudy. The actress moved in with Rudy at the time but later chose to have an abortion.

Kelly recalled making the decision after her mom suggested they raise the baby together.

""Raise this baby together, how?"" Kelly wrote, according to excerpts obtained by Page Six. ""With what money? What home? What insurance? I couldn’t imagine bringing a baby into what my mother brought me into. Absolutely not.""

""That was it. In that moment, I knew the right choice,"" she added. ""Raising a child with my mother would only continue this family trauma, another cycle added to so many generations of pain. Hadn’t there been enough damage already?""

The ""Just Go With It"" star detailed her toxic relationship with Rudy, explaining that he had coerced her into making a sex tape, which he later sold back to her for $50,000 after trying to sell it to the tabloids.

""I hardly even remembered making the tape,"" she wrote in the book. ""I’d become such a master at leaving my body when things were uncomfortable.""

Kelly had moved to New Mexico with her mother to live with Mo's boyfriend, David. According to Kelly, he beat her after Mo told him the actress had been ""borrowing"" the car.

""He hit me with an open hand, then a fist, over and over,"" Kelly claimed. ""He found a piece of cable wire on the floor and started thrashing me with it as I curled into a ball to protect what parts of myself I could. ... He yanked my hair, pulling me around the room by my ponytail. ... How long the beating continued, I don’t know. Welts were rising all over my skin when he finally exhausted his fury.""

Kelly recalled him asking for a hug after the beating.

""'You a--hole,' I wanted to say,"" she writes. ""'You f--king monster!' I wanted to cry and scream and tell them both to go f--k themselves, but that would only make it worse. I held it in.""

Kelly returned to Los Angeles after finishing high school and studied to become a surgical technician while acting. She was also able to reconnect with her father, a former guitarist for Aerosmith.

Kelly also wrote about her toxic relationship with ""Friday Night Lights"" co-star Taylor Kitsch in the memoir. She landed the role of Lyla Garrity on the drama, which ran from 2006 to 2009.

""All the effort I might have invested in connecting consistently with the girls on the show went to Taylor. So when my relationship with Taylor became toxic, I had no one to turn to,"" she revealed.

""Life became very difficult both on and off set whenever we broke up. We were young and had very few tools to handle our emotions and personal grievances. On the days we had to work together and were broken up, he didn’t want to be in the hair and makeup trailer at the same time I was.""

Department of Justice announced a 59-count indictment of eight members and associates of the Crips gang on Thursday for several violent crimes across Long Island, New York as well as firearms offenses, racketeering and fraud.

The eight members and associates belong to a subset of the Crips known as the Insane Crip Gang, or ICG.

The defendants named in the indictment are Akeem Chambers, of Uniondale, New York; Jahziah Dindyal, 19, of Hempstead, New York; Jonathan Gonzalez, 23, of Greensboro, North Carolina; Lesly Pardo, 26, of Mount Sinai, New York; Rob Pardo, 25, of Mount Sinai, New York; Jalen Rogers, 20, of Hempstead, New York; and Jonathan Vazquez, 21, of Hempstead, New York.

ARREST OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS LEAK SUSPECT JACK TEIXEIRA MET WITH OUTRAGE: ‘INCOMPETENCE IS STUNNING’

According to a press release from the DOJ, seven of the suspects were taken into custody on Thursday morning and one remains at large.

The suspects are accused of participating in dozens of gang-related shootings and multiple murders in Nassau County, New York since 2015.

Chambers, the release read, took part in over a dozen shootings between 2020 and 2022. One of those shootings resulted in the death of 28-year-old Thiasia Williams.

On Aug. 1, 2020, Chambers, Rob Pardo and another associate of the ICG went to a party in Hempstead where members of a rival gang were expected to be.

Chambers and an associate, each armed with a 9mm fired at least eight times at party goers with Gonzalez behind the wheel. One of the bullets struck Williams, who was sitting in her car outside the party to pick up a friend. Another bystander was also struck by gunfire, and the wound was non-life-threatening.

Chambers is also accused of participating in the robbery of James Diamond in Freeport, New York in 2021. During the incident, Chambers and another person were armed with guns, approached Diamond and another man, and attempted to rob them at gunpoint.

The DOJ said Chambers’ co-conspirator shot and killed Diamond.

Rogers was charged with more than a half-dozen violent crimes including attempted murder and attempted kidnapping, and at least three of the crimes occurred while he was wearing a court-ordered GPS ankle monitor that placed him at the scene of shootings.

Washington state judge addresses abortion pill ruling contradicting Texas judge,"A federal judge in Washington state is clarifying his ruling on access to the abortion pill that contradicts prior rulings by two other federal courts.

In a separate suit brought by 17 states with Democrat attorneys general, Judge Thomas O. Rice issued a ruling that compels the FDA not to do anything that might affect the availability of the abortion drug mifepristone in the suing states.

Rice said his decision, maintaining full unencumbered access to the drug, remains in effect ""irrespective of the Northern District of Texas Court’s ruling or the Fifth Circuit’s anticipated ruling."" That includes access to the drug by mail.

Rice was asked to clarify his position following a federal appeals court ruling late Wednesday that the mifepristone can still be used for now but reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be taken and said it could not be dispensed by mail.

The decision temporarily narrowed a ruling by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the FDA's approval of the drug while a lawsuit over it plays out.

The Biden administration said Thursday it would appeal. The Supreme Court will be the next stop for a legal fight over a drug used in the nation's most common abortion method.

Mifepristone was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration more than two decades ago. It has been used by more than 5 million women to terminate their pregnancies and today more than half of women who end a pregnancy rely on the drug, the DOJ said.

Rice’s order marks a legal victory for abortion rights advocates, but creates further confusion over how the FDA should enforce mifepristone.

Rice’s decision will likely be cited by the Justice Department when it files its appeal with the Supreme Court seeking to reverse key parts of the earlier appeals court ruling.

Blackhawks to part ways with captain Jonathan Toews; regular-season finale to serve as send-off,"Jonathan Toews and the Chicago Blackhawks will soon go their separate ways.

The team revealed its decision to not re-sign the team captain, making Thursday night's regular-season finale Toews' Chicago send-off.

After missing time due to chronic immune response syndrome and long COVID, the 34-year-old rejoined the team in early April.

Thursday will mark the end of Toews' 15th season in the league. He has not publicly mentioned retiring.

""I've had a number of conversations with Jonathan throughout the season about his future with the Blackhawks, and recently, we had the difficult conversation that we won't be re-signing him this offseason,"" Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said in a statement.

""Tonight will be his final game as a Blackhawk, and it was very important to us to be able to provide the proper send-off for Jonathan and our fans.""

The Blackhawks will welcome the Philadelphia Flyers to the United Center Thursday night. Chicago defeated Philly in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals with Toews receiving playoff MVP honors.

Toews entered the 2022-23 season on the final year of his eight-year, $84 million contract. In the 53 games he has played this season, he has recorded 14 goals and 16 assists.

Following a series of conversations, Davidson said he told Toews of the decision while the team was in Seattle last week. The GM also said he had talked to CEO Danny Wirtz, the son of Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz, about the move.

""Danny and Rocky spoke with Jonathan, not about this, just to kind of reminisce about what was lived and experienced and just to show that respect and share in the memories that were made together,"" Davidson said. ""So, when you're moving on from someone like Jonathan Toews, they have to be involved. They have to be, given the status and stature of the player.""

The Blackhawks selected Toews with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2006 NHL Draft. He became the team captain when he was just 20 years old in July 2008

Toews became a pivotal part of the 2010, 2013 and 2015 Stanley Cup championship teams. In 1,066 regular-season games, Toews has 371 goals and 511 assists. In 139 career playoff games, he has posted 45 goals and 74 assists.

""He has done so much for this organization, and no matter where he plays next, we're excited our fans get the chance to show Jonathan exactly how much he means to them,"" Davidson said in his statement.

Last month, Toews prioritized his long-term health and ability to lead a ""normal life."" He also mentioned that he wants to close out his tenure in Chicago on a high note.

""It's definitely on my mind that this could be my last few weeks here as a Blackhawk in Chicago,"" Toews said last month. ""It's definitely very important for me to go out there and enjoy the game and just kind of soak it in and just really appreciate everything I've been able to be part of here in Chicago.""

Conservative activist launches 'Ultra Right' beer as rival to Bud Light after Dylan Mulvaney controversy,"Bud Light's recent partnership with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney has driven one Republican to launch his own beer that's specifically marketed to conservatives.

The beer — dubbed the ""Conservative Dad's Ultra Right"" — is currently being sold online, and the response has been ""nuts,"" according to the man behind the mission to defeat ""woke corporations.""

Speaking to Fox News Digital about his efforts, Seth Weathers, the CEO of Freedom Speaks Up, said companies like Anheuser-Busch are ""spitting on"" conservative values.

""I have kids and I don't care what their response is, Bud Light has hired a mentally deranged freak to market perversion to little children. I have a problem with that,"" Weathers said. ""Corporations that do that should be put out of business by conservatives. They are spitting on us. We are half of America — they're spitting on us. There has to be an alternative.""

ANHEUSER-BUSCH SHEDS ROUGHLY $5 BILLION IN VALUE SINCE BUD LIGHT’S DYLAN MULVANEY PACT SPARKED OUTRAGE

Weathers said he understands the difficulty in boycotting all the ""woke"" corporations, but he believes Anheuser-Busch, now the largest brewing company in the world, is a good place to start.

""I would love for them to stick to it,"" Weather said of Republicans' and conservatives' refusal to drink Bud Light in the aftermath of the Mulvaney partnership. ""Their mistake was so big in exposing who they are,"" he added.

""We can't boycott 10 companies, but we can boycott one that sells a s--- beer,"" he said. ""If we stuck to that, we would send a message that would live forever.… I don't care if they buy my beer. Either buy my beer, some other brand's beer, it doesn't matter. Send a message to Anheuser-Busch. Shut them down.""

The name behind the beer, ""Ultra Right,"" Weathers said, stems from social media comments made by left-wing activists toward anyone who has ""any level of common sense.""

Made by a local brewery in northern Illinois, Weathers said his beverage that launched Wednesday as a rival to Bud Light is considered a ""light beer,"" even though that phrasing it is not apparent on the can due to certain legalities.

Weathers appears in the ad announcing the beer, which was shared to social media.

""America's been buying beer from a company that doesn't even know which restroom to use,"" Weathers wrote in a tweet announcing the product. ""There's a new beer in town.""

Weathers described the beverage as ""100% woke-free beer"" in the ad and pleaded with those who ""know which bathroom to use"" to ""stop giving money to woke corporations that hate our values.""

He told Fox News Digital that the response to the launch of Ultra Right, which sells for $19.99 for a six-pack not including shipping, has been overwhelming from conservatives.

""Conservatives are blowing me away with the positive response. It's absolutely nuts,"" he said. ""I think we're at 10 million views on Twitter right now for that video.… The response is even wilder than I thought it would be. The left is doing the usual thing such as sending death threats and being nasty, so that's all I can say for their response.

""The overwhelming positive response we're getting, it means a lot to me. I know a lot of people are paying a lot of shipping to get this, they're paying more than they would to get their Bud Light. They're doing it because they're supporting the message we stand for and what we're doing and that genuinely means a lot to me and everyone involved.""

Weathers, who insisted Bud Light's partnership with Mulvaney was a ""slap to the face"" of women across America, said he is working to get his beer, which is currently available to 42 states, in retail stores soon.

Earlier this month, Mulvaney, a trans activist and social media influencer who gained prominence when given an opportunity to interview President Biden about LGBTQ issues in 2022, revealed a partnership with Anheuser-Busch that included packs of Bud Light with Mulvaney's face printed on the cans as part of an ad for the beer company’s March Madness contest and as a way to celebrate a full year of ""girlhood.""

North Korea fired 'new type of ballistic missile' in launch that sparked Japan evacuation warning,"The North Korean launch that sparked Japan to issue a warning to citizens of its northernmost main island to ""evacuate immediately"" may have involved a ""new type of ballistic missile,"" a South Korean military official says.

The official, speaking to Reuters, said South Korea is ""still analyzing details like the trajectory, altitude and range, with the possibility that it carried a solid-fuel propellant.""

If the missile was a solid-fuel ICBM – which is easier to transport and can be fired faster than missiles using liquid propellants – it would be North Korea’s first test of such a missile, according to The Associated Press.

""So far we assess that they fired a new type of ballistic missile with an intermediate or intercontinental range,"" the official said to Reuters, adding that the missile appeared to have been displayed at a recent North Korean military parade.

The missile took off near Pyongyang and landed about 620 miles away in waters off the east coast of North Korea around an hour later, Japan’s coast guard reportedly said.

The launch prompted Japan to warn residents of Hokkaido – its northernmost main island – to take cover, warning that it was likely to fall near there around 8 a.m. local time.

But the message later was retracted after an analysis determined the missile had no chance of landing in Japan's territory, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno.

Arizona mother describes AI phone scam faking daughter's kidnapping,"Arizona mother Jennifer DeStefano recounted a terrifying experience when phone scammers used artificial intelligence technology to make her think her teenage daughter was kidnapped.

Local news channel KPHO reported the story on Monday with DeStafano describing a recent incident when she received a call from an unknown number. Because her daughter was on a ski trip at the time, she answered the call out of concern of an accident.

DeStefano explained, ""I pick up the phone and I hear my daughter’s voice, and it says, ‘Mom!’ and she’s sobbing. I said, ‘What happened?’ And she said, ‘Mom, I messed up,’ and she’s sobbing and crying.""

""This man gets on the phone and he’s like, ‘Listen here. I’ve got your daughter. This is how it’s going to go down. You call the police, you call anybody, I’m going to pop her so full of drugs. I’m going to have my way with her and I’m going to drop her off in Mexico.’ And at that moment, I just started shaking. In the background she’s going, ‘Help me, Mom. Please help me. Help me,’ and bawling,"" she continued.

DeStefano happened to be at her other daughter’s dance studio at the time where fellow mothers assisted her by calling 911 as well as DeStefano’s husband. After a few minutes, they were able to confirm that DeStefano’s daughter was safe. Despite this, DeStefano described feeling shaken at the experience.

""It was completely her voice. It was her inflection. It was the way she would have cried. I never doubted for one second it was her. That’s the freaky part that really got me to my core,"" she said.

The call came amidst a rise in ""spoofing"" schemes with fraudster claiming that they have kidnapped loved ones to receive ransom money using voice cloning technology. A TikTok user named Chelsie Gates garnered more than 2.5 million views on a video recounting her own experience in December.

Susan Rice roasted for claiming racism has cost the US $16 trillion,"Social media users mocked White House Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice’s claim that racism has had a massive impact on the U. S. economy during a speech on Wednesday.

Rice appeared as a guest at the National Action Network's, founded by Al Sharpton, convention in New York City to speak about the White House’s commitment to promoting civil rights. During her speech, she made the radical claim that the United States has suffered a $16 trillion shortfall because of racism.

""In the last 20 years, the U. S. had a GDP shortfall of $16 trillion due to discrimination against Black Americans. If we closed our racial gaps, we could add another $5 trillion to GDP over just the next five years. And in case you’re wondering, that’s not my math, that’s, according to Citibank. We all benefit when every community has the chance to thrive,"" Rice said.

This claim faced scrutiny and scorn by Twitter users for the extreme estimate about the impact of racism.

"Calif Rep Katie Porter's ex-husband stands by domestic abuse allegations against her, contradicting campaign","EXCLUSIVE: The ex-husband of California Democrat Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter said he does ""not recant"" his domestic abuse allegations against the congresswoman after her campaign said that he did.

The allegations against Porter include claims that she dumped hot potatoes on her then-husband's head and smashed a glass that led to him being cut by flying shards. Porter has separately faced accusations of running a toxic, emotionally abusive workplace by former staffers.

According to divorce documents received by Fox News Digital, Porter and her ex-husband, Matt Hoffman, both filed domestic violence restraining orders against each other after an April 2013 altercation at the home they shared while legally separated.

Hoffman alleged that Porter hit him ""in the arm, causing a large bruise,"" dumped boiling potatoes on his head and ridiculed him as ""too dumb"" to have a cellphone. He said that the congresswoman ""waited all day, then called the police"" and ""made false allegations"" against him 11 hours after a confrontation while brushing their teeth the day the police were called to their residence.

Police arrested Hoffman on battery charges at the residence after the confrontation in April 2013. Porter requested the temporary restraining order the next day.

Documents obtained by Fox News Digital state that Hoffman regretted making the allegations against Porter in a court-ordered child custody evaluation, but it doesn't specify whether his regret was due to a lack of veracity or another reason.

Porter’s campaign told Fox News Digital that Hoffman had ""retracted"" his statement, but Hoffman said he did ""not recant"" his allegations against the congresswoman.

Hoffman said he did not ""recall stating I regretted making the allegations but, again, it's been a long time.""

""I do not recant the allegations,"" Hoffman added.

Porter’s spokesperson, Lindsay Reilly, told Fox News Digital that on ""the morning of the hearing on Porter’s request for a temporary restraining order following documented violence by her then-husband, her then-husband’s lawyer filed a reciprocal request for protection.""

""This common defensive tactic is designed to intimidate a victim. Her then-husband later admitted, as evidenced by the attached document, that ‘he regretted making these allegations,’"" Reilly said.

""Porter’s then-husband’s allegation was not supported by any evidence, other than his false and later retracted statement,"" she continued.

""Porter's account was supported by police accounts, a doctor's recommendation after a child custody evaluation, her sole request for a move-out order and property control, and ultimately a judge's decision granting her majority physical custody,"" Reilly added.

Porter has repeatedly denied the abuse allegations, which Hoffman made amid a contentious separation and divorce process in 2012 and 2013. But the accusations bubbled back to the surface after multiple former Porter staffers blew the whistle on what they described as Porter's toxic, emotionally abusive management style.

Porter and Hoffman separated in March 2013 and continued to live with each other until their divorce was finalized in December of that year, but the two alleged abuse from each other while living together during their separation.

Divorce filings obtained by Fox News Digital included 2012 allegations from Hoffman that Porter shattered a glass coffee pot after becoming angry over their dirty house, causing him to cut his hands and arms.

Hoffman also alleged that, while married, the congresswoman frequently berated him as a ""f---ing idiot"" and ""f---ing incompetent"" and dumped ""steaming hot potatoes"" on his head during a 2006 confrontation.

""She would not let me have a cellphone because she said, 'You're too f---ing dumb to operate it,'' Hoffman said in comments first resurfaced by the Daily Mail this week.

In her restraining order, Porter alleged Hoffman swore at her and called her names and ""grabbed both [of her] hands and squeezed"" during the April 2013 confrontation that led to his arrest.

The congresswoman also alleged that Hoffman had used his elbow to push her aside after rushing toward her, causing her to stumble and catch herself on a nearby bookshelf.

Porter said she went to find her daughter during the altercation and that Hoffman had yelled at her that she ""was ruining"" their family with the divorce.

""He would not let me leave. It seemed like five minutes or more that I was trapped in the laundry room with him,"" Porter said in the divorce documents.

""He told me that I better not call the police, because if I did, our children would go to foster care,"" Porter said. ""More terrifying, respondent then said, ‘Do you want me to kill myself? Is that what you are trying to make happen here?'""

Hoffman was the primary caretaker of the couple’s three children while Porter was the breadwinner for the family.

Florida sues Biden administration over crack pipe controversy,"FIRST ON FOX — Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody is suing the Biden administration for failing to provide evidence that taxpayer dollars are not being used to purchase crack pipes for drug addicts.

In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Moody asked a federal court to compel the Justice Department and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to comply with outstanding Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for documentation related to possible federal grant funds used to promote drug use through Safe Smoking Kits. Some of those kits reportedly included crack pipes and other drug-related paraphernalia, even though the Biden administration has said crack pipes are not being distributed this way.

The FOIA requests were made more than a year ago. According to federal statue, the agencies were required to respond within 20 working days of receipt, and that deadline was March 10, 2022.

Moody claims that the agencies have so far refused to provide any requested documentation, prompting her to take legal action.

""If Biden is using your tax dollars to buy crack pipes for drug addicts, you have the right to know,"" Moody said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""Our country is in the grips of a drug overdose crisis, and the Biden administration is stonewalling our requests and keeping the public in the dark about so many misguided, reckless policies. We are taking them to court to get answers for the American people,"" she said.

In February 2022, President Biden announced a $30 million federal grant program that would reimburse local governments and entities that provide safe ""smoking kits,"" in the name of advancing racial equity and safer drug use for addicts.

The grant document references Biden's executive order 13985 titled ""Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.""

Last year, the Washington Free Beacon reported that those kits would provide users with the ability to smoke ""any illicit substance,"" including crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamine. The story also noted existing smoking kit programs in cities such as San Francisco, Annapolis, Maryland, and Seattle all include smoking pipes.

The White House and HHS repeatedly denied that crack pipes would be distributed on the taxpayer dime, but the Beacon subsequently reported that harm-reduction organizations in five East Coast cities – New York City, Washington, D. C., Boston, Baltimore and Richmond, Virginia – all included crack pipes in their so-called safe smoking kits.

In the legal filing, Moody said Florida has exhausted all of its administrative remedies to obtain the requested information.

The complaint states that the Biden administration's actions harm Florida by continuously denying the state access to documents to which it has a legal right.

""This harm is irreparable because no monetary damages can compensate Florida for this loss. Florida will continue to be irreparably harmed unless and until Defendants are compelled to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law.""

Evan Gershkovich declared 'unlawfully detained' as Biden admin goes on 'full-court press' for his release,"The saga of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich took another step this week as the U. S. officially designated him ""unlawfully detained"" by Russia.

This means his case will now be specially handled by the State Department's Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and unlock more resources for his potential release. It also signifies that he is viewed officially as a political prisoner and not a legitimate detainee of Russia.

The office's special envoy Roger Carstens said Wednesday the administration was in a ""full-court press"" during an interview with CBS News.

""Senior members of the U. S. government, including Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, have met with their counterparts in Russia to try to press them to release Evan and to gain more information,"" he said. ""We've also been trying to gain consular access to him and have yet to have any luck in that.""

Asked to elaborate, Carstens said with the official designation, they could work with the Russians on strategies to free both Gershkovich and former U. S. Marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence in a labor camp on espionage charges also widely viewed as bogus. Carstens said he wouldn't get into specifics about a possible prisoner swap to bring home Americans, worrying it would weaken the U.S.' negotiating position.

""In terms of how he's being treated right now, we don't really have a sense,"" Carstens said, noting Gershkovich is being held in the notorious Lefortovo prison. He said he was also ""working"" to create a deterrent strategy to make it more costly and thus less likely for Russia to snatch American citizens for political gain.

The U. S. has all along asserted that Russia's allegation that Gershkovich is a spy is absurd on its face, as have his colleagues, who describe the 31-year-old as a diligent reporter who is being used as a political pawn due to his high profile. He was detained March 29 in Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in Russia. Russian authorities formally charged him last week with collecting ""information constituting a state secret about the activities of an enterprise within Russia’s military-industrial complex,"" according to Russian state media outlet Tass.

""Putin's Playbook"" author Rebekah Koffler explained the significance of the decision by the U. S. to designate him as an unlawful detainee, which includes helping his family obtain financial support for any legal fees they may incur.

DETAINED WSJ REPORTER EVAN GERSHKOVICH'S COLLEAGUES SPEAK OUT ON HIS PASSION FOR JOURNALISM, RUSSIA

""The designation of Evan Gershkovich as 'wrongfully detained' enabled the U. S. government to mount special resources needed to obtain his freedom and to support his family through this ordeal,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""This status will allow [the administration] to build a team that will engage in negotiations with the Russians about prisoner exchange, prioritize intelligence collection to get insights into his status and whether his life is threatened, share information with the family, placing media pressure on the Russian government, build international support and apply pressure to the Russian government to help secure Evan’s release.""

""We are encouraged that the State Department has officially designated Evan as wrongfully detained,"" the family said in a statement. ""We appreciate President Biden’s call to us today, assuring us that the U. S. government is doing everything in its power to bring him home as quickly as possible.

""In addition to being a distinguished journalist, Evan is a beloved son and brother. There is a hole in our hearts and in our family that won’t be filled until we are reunited. We are grateful for the outpouring of support from his colleagues, friends and everyone standing with Evan and advocating for his immediate release.""

BROTHER OF RUSSIA DETAINEE PAUL WHELAN CALLS ON BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO GET HIM, IMPRISONED WSJ REPORTER HOME

Financial Times reporter Polina Ivanova, a close friend of Gershkovich, also praised the move.

""It's great news, and I think everyone's happy to see things progress swiftly,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Every day counts, for Evan, for his family… The designation is really the first step and a lot kicks into gear once it is in place. Glad to see things moving forward with determination.""

In a statement this week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said journalism was not a crime and condemned the Kremlin's ""continued repression of independent voices in Russia, and its ongoing war against the truth.""

""The U. S. government will provide all appropriate support to Mr. Gershkovich and his family. We call for the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr. Gershkovich,"" Blinken said.

President Biden addressed the situation with reporters Tuesday before boarding Air Force One for Ireland.

""We’re making it real clear that it’s totally illegal what’s happening, and we declared it so. It changes the dynamic,"" Biden said.

Polish woman apologizes to missing British girl's parents,"A Polish woman who used social media to help determine whether she might be missing Madeleine McCann, a British toddler who disappeared from a family vacation in Portugal in 2007, is now apologizing to the McCann family after getting DNA test results back.

The Polish woman, Julia Faustyna, who also goes by Julia Wandelt, had been claiming for weeks on Instagram and TikTok that she may be McCann, but DNA test results apparently showed that she is not British at all, according to her former spokesperson, social media star Dr. Fia Johansson.

""I don’t remember most of my memories but I can remember some things and I never said that I am Madeleine McCann,"" Faustyna, who made accounts called @iammadeleinemccann on Instagram and TikTok, said in a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday. ""I used this sentence to create a nick[name] for my old instagram account, it was my mistake and I know it and I apologize for that because I should use words, 'Am I Madeleine McCann,' not 'I am.'""

She continued: ""So it was my fault and It wasn’t my intention to bring sadness or another negative emotional [sic] to anyone, especially to McCann’s family. My main purpose was always to find out who I am and what exactly happened in my very hurtful past.""

MADELEINE MCCANN: POLISH WOMAN CLAIMING TO BE MISSING BRITISH TODDLER GETS DNA TEST RESULTS

Faustyna detailed a troubled past and blurry memory in the Facebook post and said she started looking into the McCann case after seeing a photo of the missing girl online. Faustyna said she has a spot in her right eye and a beauty mark on her cheek that resemble McCann's. She also claimed that details of her childhood do not add up, leading her to believe that she was abducted as a toddler.

The Polish woman in her 20s amassed tens of thousands of followers — many of whom were critical of her claims — on her social media pages. She and Johansson, a psychic social media personality who offered to represent Faustyna as she made global headlines, even appeared on ""Dr. Phil"" together last month. Johansson broke the news about Faustyna's DNA results in an April 4 statement.

""The test results revealed that she is 100% of Polish heart, with negligible influence from Lithuania and Russia,"" Johansson said in a statement posted to Instagram. ""The DNA test results did not show any connection to British or even German roots.""

""She truly believed what she was saying, and with so many questions about her childhood it is easy to understand where she was coming from,"" Johansson continued.

Faustyna is now accepting donations through a GoGetFunding page.

Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were on vacation in Praia da Luz, Portugal, along with their three young children when Madeleine was taken from her bed on May 3, 2007. The family were staying in a ground-floor apartment.

"Georgia inmate eaten alive by bugs in conditions 'not fit for a deceased animal,' family attorney says","Lashawn Thompson was allegedly eaten alive by bugs in his Atlanta jail cell while awaiting trial for a June 2022 misdemeanor simple battery charge, according to his family's attorney.

Now, the 35-year-old's family is calling for the closure of the Fulton County Jail, as well as a criminal investigation into Thompson's death.

""People like him get neglected. His parents are deceased. No wife, no kids. His family's not from Atlanta, so they weren't here while he was here to keep up with him. But they got the call that he had died in the jail,"" attorney Michael Harper of the Harper Law Firm told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Jail officials placed Thompson in the psychiatric wing after determining he had schizophrenia, Harper said. The attorney shared several extremely graphic photos of Thompson and the filth he allegedly died in at the detention facility in a Wednesday press release.

""The family approved photographs…. show[ing] that the jail cell Mr. Thompson was housed in was not fit for a deceased animal,"" Harper wrote. ""He did not deserve this. Someone has to be held accountable for his death. The Fulton County Jail must be closed and replaced.""

Three months after his placement in the psychiatric wing, Thompson ""was found in a filthy jail cell after being eaten alive by insects and bed bugs,"" the press release states.

Public records obtained by Harper's law office apparently show that detention officers and medical staff at the jail noticed Thompson's deterioration — including an infection from bedbugs and lice on his torso — while he was still alive but did nothing to aid him.

There were ""plans"" to transfer him to another unit of the jail that never came to fruition when they eventually found Thompson dead in the cell, Harper alleged.

""They literally watched his health decline until he died. When his body was found one of the detention officers refused to administer CPR because in her words she 'freaked out,'"" Harper wrote in the press release.

'Princess Bride' star Cary Elwes shares thoughts on possibility of reboot,"Cary Elwes, star of the beloved 1987 cult fantasy film ""The Princess Bride,"" doesn’t think there’s a shot at it ever being remade

Elwes told ""E! News"" in a recent interview, ""There's no reboot.""

He continued, ""There was a studio head one time who suggested that, and he posted it on Twitter, and I responded, 'There's a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one.'""

The 60-year-old actor had responded to a 2019 tweet from Variety in which Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra had told the outlet, ""Very famous people whose names I won't use, but they want to redo ‘The Princess Bride.’""

'THE PRINCESS BRIDE' CAST: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

Elwes paraphrased one of his more famous quotes from the movie in his response, and he said that it ""got quite a sizeable response of positive feedback"" at the time.

He added a definitive opinion: ""I don't think you can touch it.""

""The Princess Bride,"" based on the 1973 novel of the same name, premiered in 1987 and celebrated its 35th anniversary last year. It wasn’t a box-office hit when it first played in theaters, but over the decades it has become a family favorite for many people, with its quotable lines and memorable moments.

The closest the film has come to being remade was in 2020 during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, when dozens of celebrities recreated the movie shot for shot and line for line at home with improvised costumes and props. Elwes even appeared, but instead recreating his role as the hero Westley, he played the evil Prince Humperdinck.

The charming recreations were broadcast on the now-defunct Quibi.

Elwes also told ""E! News"" that the cast remains close.

""We do get together, and we do celebrate each other,"" he told the outlet. ""We're all one big family now thanks to this wonderful film.""

The actor noted that there aren’t any plans at the moment for the cast to reunite on screen.

Mötley Crüe manager says Mick Mars is a victim of 'elder abuse' amid touring dispute,"Mötley Crüe's manager claimed Mick Mars' representatives are ""taking advantage"" of the guitarist amid the group's recent touring dispute.

In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Mick Mars accused the band of forcing him to resign after he chose to stop touring. However, the band's manager Allen Kovac and a lawyer for the band claimed representatives for Mars, including the guitarist's lawyer, ""manipulated"" him into the dispute.

Kovac, who has managed the heavy metal band for the past 29 years, told Fox News Digital, ""Every time there was a problem, [Mick] would call me. I haven't heard from Mick. I would have protected him from the elderly abuse that [the representatives] are taking advantage of him with.""

A representative for Mars had no comment regarding the ""elder abuse"" allegation.

Mars filed a mandate of writ on April 6 claiming Mötley Crüe had been slow to turn over documents, but Mötley Crüe's lawyer Sasha Frid of Miller Barondess told Fox News Digital there is ""no issue"" regarding documents.

""We're an open book. We're not hiding any documents from this guy,"" Frid claimed. ""There's no issue with documents. You want your documents, here are your documents.""

The mandate of writ was filed ahead of the band and Mars going to arbitration over a shareholders agreement amendment signed in 2008. At the time, all original members of the band – Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Nikki Six and Mick Mars – signed an agreement stating they would not be entitled to any touring revenue or any value of the Mötley Crüe name once they had resigned from the band, according to Frid.

""It's common sense,"" Frid explained. ""If you're not out on the road touring, you don't get any money from touring. Just like when I don't go to work, I don't get a paycheck.""

Mötley Crüe previously claimed that when Mars announced that he couldn't tour anymore, he was resigning from the band. However, in court documents Mars alleges that he told the band members that he could still play in a residency situation and could still record.

The guitarist just could no longer ""physically handle the rigor of the roads.""

""It is beyond sad that, after 41 years together, a band would try to throw out a member who is unable to tour anymore because he has a debilitating disease,"" Mars' attorney Ed McPherson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Mick has been pushed around for far too long in this band, and we are not going to let that continue.""

Meanwhile, lawyers for Mötley Crüe maintain that Mars gave up his rights to any future earnings from tours after he quit.

The back-and-forth between Mars and Mötley Crüe began in October. Fans became confused due to differing statements. Mars announced that he was retiring from touring due to his arthritis, while the band claimed that he was retiring from music completely.

""Things get twisted around sometimes from other band members. I don’t really know if I should say this, but… those guys have been hammering on me since ’87, trying to replace me,"" Mars told Variety. ""They haven’t been able to do that, because I’m the guitar player. I helped form this band. It’s my name I came up with [the Mötley Crüe moniker], my ideas, my money that I had from a backer to start this band. It wouldn’t have gone anywhere.""

Frid and Kovac claim that after Mars announced he was retiring from touring, the guitarist was offered a ""generous compensation package"" despite being entitled to nothing due to the 2008 amendment.

""Despite the fact that the band did not owe Mick anything – and with Mick owing the band millions in advances that he did not pay back – the band offered Mick a generous compensation package to honor his career with the band,"" Frid explained to Fox News Digital. ""Manipulated by his manager and lawyer, Mick refused and chose to file this ugly public lawsuit.""

The ""generous compensation package"" included 7.5% of the remaining tour revenue, according to Kovac. However, Mars and McPherson claimed the musician was entitled to 25% of all touring for the history of the band in perpetuity.

Frid claimed there was no reason to file the writ of mandate, and says the documents requested by Mars could have been recovered through arbitration.

""If this lawsuit was really about documents, then Mick and his lawyer would not have spilled ink recanting a 41-year band history and badmouthing the band’s performance on tours,"" the lawyer said.

""Mick and his lawyer filed this lawsuit to make derogatory statements so that they can be protected from a defamation lawsuit under California’s litigation privilege,"" he claimed. ""This lawsuit is nothing more than a malicious attempt to smear the band and Mick’s former bandmates to gain leverage – orchestrated by Mick’s lawyer.""

In Mars' lawsuit, he also claimed other members of the band were not actually playing while on stage. Specifically, he claimed Nikki Six's parts were all pre-recorded and some of Neil and Lee's were as well.

However, the band obtained signed declarations from crew members, who Kovac claimed are ""independent contractors,"" on Feb. 9 stating that Mars was actually the band member not playing live. Mötley Crüe chose not to publicize these declarations until Mars' lawsuit.

Mars' lawyer claimed the declarations came from ""employees"" of the band.

Few heavy metal acts were as notorious in the 1980s – onstage and off – as Mötley Crüe, whose songs include ""Looks That Kill,"" ""Shout at the Devil"" and ""Girls, Girls, Girls."" Fueled by drugs and booze, their stage show included excessive amounts of pyrotechnics and chain-sawing the head off a mannequin filled with blood.

Mötley Crüe was formed in 1981 by Sixx and Tommy Lee. The two were later joined by Mars and Vince Neil.

"Princess Margaret endured ‘a deep sadness’ on her deathbed over ‘forbidden’ lover Peter Townsend, doc claims","Princess Margaret spent her final days reminiscing about her true love.

The claim was made by George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, in a new ITVX docuseries titled ""The Real Crown: Inside the House of Windsor."" The five-part documentary aims to examine the struggles the British royal family has endured over the years.

Carey, who was Archbishop between 1996 and 2002, revealed in the documentary that he visited Queen Elizabeth II’s younger sister on her deathbed in 2002.

""She was sad,"" he recalled, as quoted by U. K.’s Daily Mail. ""There were moments when she expressed that sadness.""

""Here is a woman who longed for love and commitment, and the love of her life was forbidden from her, and there was a deep human sadness in that,"" he shared.

The princess first met Peter Townsend in 1947 when she was 17 years old. She quickly fell head over heels for the dashing World War II fighter pilot who was married with two sons.

A year after Townsend divorced his first wife, he proposed to Margaret, who was 16 years his junior, in 1953. At the time, divorcées weren’t allowed to remarry in the Church of England. Margaret also required her sister’s permission to marry before the age of 25.

Despite the couple’s love for each other, the much-decorated war ace was banished from Buckingham Palace on the advice of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill to a diplomatic post in Brussels. Still, the romance survived, at least until 1955. At the time, Margaret was 25 and third in line to the throne. That year, she ended her engagement with Townsend.

""I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage,"" Margaret said in a statement to BBC Radio at the time.

""But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others,"" she shared. ""I have reached this decision entirely alone, and in doing so I have been strengthened by the unfailing support and devotion of Group Captain Townsend.""

After the couple called it quits, Townsend moved to Belgium before settling down in France. Then in 1959, he married Marie-Luce Jamagne.

""[Margaret] could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up everything – her position, her prestige, her privy purse,"" Townsend later reflected in his 1978 memoir. ""I simply hadn’t the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.""

In 1960, Margaret became engaged to Antony Armstrong-Jones. It was a quick engagement, with the couple saying, ""I do"" mere months later. But the union wasn’t to last. The pair divorced in 1978, two years after they separated.

Townsend died in 1995. He was 80.

Looking back, Carey said he believed that Margaret died with a ""deep sadness"" about her lost love.

""I talked to her quietly and said a prayer, anointed her with the oil, and she died soon after that,"" he said. ""It was a lovely moving occasion.""

Golf Digest called the win by the 21-year-old phenom ""the dawn of dominance"" and an ""epic victory that shook the game.""

Woods tore up all four rounds, including a scintillating 65 (7-under) third round on Saturday that put him in a commanding position entering the final found.

Woods was famously given a golf club the moment he could walk by his father Earl Woods, a U. S. Army Green Beret officer who served in Vietnam.

Tiger proved a natural. He shocked a national TV audience by driving golf balls at age 2 in front of Bob Hope on ""The Mike Douglas Show.""

He dominated amateur golf as a teenager, winning a record three consecutive U. S. Junior Championships (1991-93), then adding an NCAA golf title (1996) while playing for Stanford, among many other honors.

Woods turned pro in September 1996 and won two PGA Tour events before year-end. Sports Illustrated named him its ""Sportsman of the Year"" for 1996 and again in 2000.

"The 'waggle' is a complex form of communication, says study","The honeybee sure know hows to move its bee-hind.

A new study from the journal Science revealed that adult honeybees teach young bees how to dance.

The ""waggle dance"" in honeybees is a known behavior and form of communication within the species, according to the study.

AMERICAN WILDLIFE QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THESE STATS AND FACTS ABOUT ANIMALS IN THE UNITED STATES?

The dance is a ""complex form of spatial referential communication,"" it also noted.

The dance communicates direction, distance and even quality of resources — such as nectar and pollen from flowers — to honeybee nest mates.

This is done by ""encoding celestial cues, retinal optic flow and relative food value into motion and sound within the nest,"" the study explained.

ORANGE LADYBUGS AND THE SPIRITUAL MEANING BEHIND THE INSECT: WHAT TO KNOW

But to get the waggle dance down, honeybees require lessons from older bees, the study also revealed.

The experiment took place at the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Kunming, China.

It was conducted from April to June 2021 and from April to June 2022 to facilitate the survival of young bees in 10 colonies — five control and five experimental.

Honeybees that attempted to imitate the dance without prior instruction produced ""significantly more disordered dances,"" the study found.

These hiccups improved as the bees gained more waggle experience, but distance encoding errors remained permanent.

Meanwhile, honeybees that followed the direction of more experienced bees from the start showed no impairment.

Biden's transparency criticized by Americans,"People in Nashville weighed in on President Biden’s growing rift with the White House press corps and his administration’s transparency since taking office.

""He doesn't answer any questions,"" one man, David, told Fox News. ""I honestly just don't think he's in charge of the country.""

Kerry, however, said, ""I think we still get all the information we need to. Maybe he just isn't looking for the spotlight as much as others may have.""

The White House press corps grew frustrated with the president after hearing he would forgo a formal news conference during his four-day trip to Ireland this week. Biden has done only 23 press conferences since taking office, compared to 41 by President Trump, 53 by President Obama and 45 by President Bush at this point in their administrations.

Another man, Robert, said, ""Nobody really knows what's going on anymore.""

""The press corps travels with him, right?"" David said. ""I think all the media sources are getting frustrated, because they can't report on anything.""

The reporters pushed back on Biden’s lack of transparency in a Monday press conference, with one reporter asking whether the administration was ""trying to protect the president"" from their questions.

REPORTERS ERUPT ON JEAN-PIERRE OVER BIDEN NOT TAKING QUESTIONS FROM PRESS POOL: ‘THAT’S NOT TRUE'

""Certainly the president, many times, has stood in front of all of you, has taken questions on his own because he wanted to see what was on your minds. . . . That has happened multiple times, many times, during this administration. And that will certainly continue to be. When it comes to a formal press conference, I don't have anything to share with you at this time,"" she said.

Michael, visiting Nashville from Connecticut, said the press secretary’s response was ""laughable.""

""They won't let him talk to anybody – do any interviews. Donald Trump answered so many questions. Biden won't answer anything,"" he said.

""I think we all know that he doesn't run the show,"" another man, Matt, said. ""His handlers pretty much take care of everything that he does.""

""Obviously, he seems compromised to some degree,"" Pete said. ""So yeah, I think they would try to minimize that.""

Biden avoided press questions during his trip to Ukraine and Poland in February, though he held a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a trip to Ottawa in March.

Despite his cold shoulder to reporters, Biden did field questions from elementary school-age children of U. S. Embassy staffers after arriving in Dublin Wednesday.

""He doesn't want to talk about his son. He doesn't want to talk about Ukraine. He doesn't want to talk about inflation,"" Michael said. ""He doesn't want to talk about what's really hurting America.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"The 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD ZR2 heavy-duty, high-performance truck","And then there were three… Chevrolet ZR2s.

Chevrolet has unveiled the first Silverado 2500 HD ZR2 pickup, which brings the high-performance trim to its heavy-duty lineup for the first time.

The full-size truck borrows its style and tech from the midsize Colorado ZR2 and light-duty Silverado 1500 ZR2.

The two models have the highest conquest rates and bring in the youngest customers out of all the high-feature trims Chevy offers on its pickups.

The Silverado 2500 HD's blacked-out grille features a hollow ""Flowtie"" Chevrolet badge that maximizes cooling for its 401 hp 6.6-liter V8 or an optional 470 hp turbocharged V8 diesel, which cranks out a prodigious 975 lb-ft of torque.

The truck gets a beefed-up suspension with a 1.5-inch lift and an equal increase in wheel articulation that's kept in check by a set of very special Multimatic DSSV (Dynamic Suspensions Spool Valve) dampers. The shocks originally developed for IndyCar and Formula One racing cars and are able to adjust their damping force with varying impacts to keep the body under control over small bumps and the suspension from bottoming out over big ones.

Steel bumpers and skid plates plus standard 35-inch mud terrain tires further improve its off-road capability.

The upscale leather surfaces and other trim materials in its crew cab were chosen to be easy to wipe clean and the ZR2 comes with a 360-degree camera and head-up display with an inclinometer to make it easier to navigate tricky terrain.

The ZR2 is meant to be used as a toy that can haul other big toys along with it. It is rated to tow 16,000 pounds with the gasoline engine and 18,500 with the diesel, which have payload capacities of 3,397 and 3,193 pounds, respectively.

The truck can be enhanced with a Bison package developed with off-road specialist AEV that includes unique gloss black wheels; high-clearance steel bumpers with winch provisions and recovery points; stamped steel skid plates; and AEV badges.

Florida group issues travel warning to LGBTQ community over Gov. DeSantis' 'extremist policies',"A Florida civil rights organization representing the LGBTQ community issued a travel warning for the Sunshine State on Wednesday.

Equality Florida said it took the ""extraordinary step"" after receiving a wave of safety inquiries following the passage of laws that are ""are hostile to the LGBTQ community, restrict access to reproductive health care, repeal gun safety laws, foment racial prejudice, and attack public education by banning books and censoring curriculum.""

The advisory, posted on the organization’s website, warned of risks posed to the ""health, safety, and freedom"" of those considering traveling or relocating to the state.

""As an organization that has spent decades working to improve Florida’s reputation as a welcoming and inclusive place to live work and visit, it is with great sadness that we must respond to those asking if it is safe to travel to Florida or remain in the state as the laws strip away basic rights and freedoms,"" Equality Florida Executive Director Nadine Smith said in a statement.

""As the governor noted previously, this type of thing is a political stunt,"" DeSantis’ press secretary Bryan Griffin told Fox News.  ""We aren’t going to waste time worrying about political stunts but will continue doing what is right for Floridians.""

Florida's Parental Rights in Education law, referred to by critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill, and the governor's fight with Disney are both mentioned as part of the warning.

The organization claims DeSantis has ""made the extremist policies the centerpiece of his presidential campaign strategy, has weaponized state agencies to silence critics and impose sanctions on large and small companies that dissent with his culture war agenda or disagree with his attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion.""

Last month, the NAACP's Florida chapter voted unanimously in favor of asking the national organization to urge Black Americans to avoid visiting or moving to Florida. DeSantis dismissed the move as ""ridiculous.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z

""AITA for reclining my first class airplane seat?"" asked Reddit user ""skyhawk3485"" in an April 12, 2023, post in Reddit's AITA (""Am I the A--hole)"" subreddit.

In the post, the man said he was aware this is a ""hotly debated topic,"" and asked the Reddit community to weigh in on his recent experience.

""I fly 150K miles a year, so my routine is pretty frequent,"" he said in his post.

This flight, however, was different.

""Within 20 seconds of reclining back, dude taps me on the shoulder and says, ‘Raise your damn seat,’"" said skyhawk3485.

Out of ""genuine surprise,"" he said he raised his seat back up.

He then ""called over the flight attendant and told her that I intended to move it back after meal service and asked her to give the guy a heads-up,"" he said.

""She reassured me that’s my prerogative, so I didn’t worry about it,"" the Redditor continued.

Following the meal, skyhawk3485 said he reclined his seat once more, only to be chastised again by the man sitting behind him.

""I turn and say, ‘You’re welcome to talk to the flight attendant about it,'"" wrote skyhawk3485.

The flight attendant informed the other passenger that skyhawk3485 was ""entitled to recline"" his seat, he continued.

Washington firearms trainer blasts sweeping semiautomatic rifle ban,"A firearms instructor condemned Washington lawmakers for voting to ban the sale, manufacture and import of a wide array of guns in the state.

""Both sides, I think, want the same thing,"" Jane Milhans, a Washington State Rifle and Pistol Association board member, told Fox News. ""We both want to stop crime. We don't like seeing people killed. But they're targeting the wrong people.""

House Bill 1240 bans so-called ""assault weapons"" — primarily semiautomatic rifles — with exceptions for law enforcement and the military. The bill passed the Senate Saturday and will return to the House for a second vote because it was amended. The bill will take effect immediately upon Gov. Jay Inslee's signature.

Washington will become the tenth state to adopt a ban on such weapons.

""Assault weapons are civilian versions of weapons created for the military and are designed to kill humans quickly and efficiently,"" the bill states.

It bans more than 60 specific firearms, most of them semiautomatic long guns such as AR-15s and AK-47s. Semiautomatic pistols and shotguns with certain features outlined in the bill may also be banned, but the specific guns are not listed.

""The bill takes away the personal protection option that may work the best for some people,"" Milhans said.

One of her students, a woman in her 70s, recently bought her first rifle for home defense. ""I feel for people like her, that her option is also taken away,"" Milhans said.

Milhans said most crimes are committed with pistols, not rifles, and that guns used in crime are often gained illegally to begin with.

""Black market, drug deals, theft, straw purchases,"" Milhans said. ""So these bills will not stop that because none of those illegal firearm owners get background checks, go through safety training or do any of that.""

About 25% of mass shooters used ""assault weapons"" to commit their crimes, according to The Violence Project, a database supported by the National Institute of Justice. The project chronicles mass shootings in which four or more victims were murdered with firearms in a public location.

Washington has had eight such shootings since 1966, according to The Violence Project, the majority of which involved handguns.

But semiautomatic rifles have been used in other murders in the state, including the 2016 shooting at a Mukilteo house party, which spurred Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson to advocate for an ""assault weapon"" ban.

""The devastation of mass shootings extends far beyond the casualties and injuries,"" Ferguson said in a statement after HB 1240's Senate passage. ""Mass shootings traumatize entire communities. We must stop selling these weapons of war in Washington.""

People who already own semiautomatic rifles will be able to keep them when the law takes effect. But the bill also bans conversion kits and parts that can be used to assemble an ""assault weapon,"" which Milhans said will make it impossible for competitive shooters to repair their firearms.

""There's just a lot of misinformation,"" Milhans said of the gun control debate. ""People have the assumption that these rifles are military rifles and they just aren't.""

Milhans advocated for increased gun safety training, particularly in schools, and procedures to make soft targets safer.

""Because none of these laws will stop any crime,"" she said.",2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z
"'Horrible' bill banning police dogs from being used in arrests would 'embolden' criminals, sheriff says","A California sheriff criticized lawmakers who want to keep police dogs from biting suspected criminals or being used during protests, calling K-9s an important ""less-lethal"" option for law enforcement.

""One of our one of our biggest successes and biggest tools to deescalate situations is the deployment of canines,"" Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told Fox News.

SOROS-BACKED CALIFORNIA DA FLOATED KEEPING GANG MEMBERS ACCUSED OF KILLING TODDLER OUT OF JAIL: REPORT

AB 742 would prohibit police from using dogs to apprehend a suspect or for crowd control. Police dogs would not be allowed to bite people under any circumstances, according to the bill text. The bill does not prevent the use of search and rescue dogs or police K-9s that sniff out bombs or drugs.

""The use of police canines has been a mainstay in this country’s dehumanizing, cruel, and violent abuse of Black Americans and people of color for centuries,"" the bill reads, adding that police dogs were used by slave catchers and, more recently, to quell civil unrest like the Los Angeles race riots and Black Lives Matter protests.

Statistics from the California Department of Justice show no use-of-force injuries involving police dogs during civil disorder or assemblies in 2020 or 2021.

""Every agency should have canines,"" Bianco said, adding that very few deployments of canines result in bites and ""those deployments are all toward violent people.""

There are few national statistics on K-9 use or injuries associated with police dogs, but one study showed police dog bites sent nearly 33,000 people to U. S. hospitals between 2005 and 2013.

In California, police dogs accounted for nearly 14% of the use-of-force incidents that resulted in injury in 2021, according to the state's DOJ. K-9 use is also largely unregulated in California — individual police departments can set their own policies, and training guidelines published almost a decade ago are optional.

But Bianco characterized lawmakers as ""trying to take away a tool that is a non-physical use-of-force"" for police with the ""horrible bill.""

It's ""just going to make criminals more emboldened and more likely to fight with us,"" he said.

"Recession 'appears inevitable' and may have already begun, economic experts fear","New York Times columnist Peter Coy shared economists’ warnings that a U. S. recession ""appears inevitable"" in a piece published at the outlet Wednesday.

Coy noted that some experts believe the recession has already begun, telling him that if the economy is not already in recession, it will be by ""the third quarter of this year.""

Macroeconomic researcher Julian Brigden mentioned to the author that the recession has been precipitated by the Federal Reserve’s ""large and rapid interest rate increases,"" claiming the bank has been ""pile-driving this baby into the ground.""

TUCKER CARLSON: SILICON VALLEY BANK HAS GONE COMPLETELY UNDER, AND THE BIDEN ADMIN DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE

Coy opened his column by relaying the overall reason for this ""inevitable"" recession, that people are borrowing less from banks at rates that haven’t been seen since some of America’s worst economic crises.

He provided the numbers, saying, ""in the two weeks through March 29 of this year, the latest with available data from the Federal Reserve, loans and leases fell by $105 billion, or nearly 1 percent. That was the biggest two-week decline in dollar terms since the data series began in 1973 and the biggest in percentage terms since 2009, during the global financial crisis.""

The columnist provided two reasons for the dip in borrowing, one ""bad"" and one ""worse."" He wrote, ""The one you hear most is that there’s an emerging credit crunch: Banks are tightening their lending standards and turning people down for credit. That would be bad. The other possibility, though, which could be worse, is that the banks have money but people don’t want it.""

Coy noted that there is evidence that many people want to borrow, though have been finding it harder to get loans. He cited The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, which ""found that the share of consumer respondents indicating that credit was harder to get than a year ago rose to 58.2 percent in March, the highest proportion recorded since the survey’s creation in 2013.""

The author noted this data point is somewhat hopeful, stating it still shows that people want to borrow. He wrote, ""If you stop and think, though, a credit crunch, as bad as it is, at least indicates that there’s an appetite for borrowing that’s not being sated.""

TEXAS CITY USED FEDERAL COVID RELIEF FUNDS FOR ‘RACIAL EQUITY’ IN ‘AUDACIOUS’ AGENDA

However, Coy said that at the same time there ""are signs that the observable dip in loans and leases is at least partly due to weak demand,"" and noted, ""When you really have to start worrying is when people don’t want to borrow because they see bad times ahead. In that situation, monetary policy becomes less effective.""

The piece cited a survey indicating this demand slow down: ""A New York Fed survey in February found that the application rate for any type of credit over the preceding 12 months declined to its lowest point since October 2020.""

Discounting the idea that this slowdown was due to fear of applications ""being turned down,"" Coy added, ""the reported overall rejection rate for credit applicants decreased to 17.3 percent from 18.8 percent in October 2022, the bank said.""

He also pointed to the ominous figure that small businesses, which ""rely on a lot of bank loans,"" aren’t borrowing much either.

According to a March report from the National Federation of Independent Business, ""Only 2 percent were planning an expansion, the least since March 2009."" Coy pointed out that at the same time ""only 2 percent of owners reported in March that all their borrowing needs were not satisfied.""

The author quoted economic forecaster David Rosenberg, who looked at that data and observed, ""That is a major ‘yikes!’""

Brigden, founder of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, told Coy that the data shows ""that a recession in the United States appears inevitable,"" and that if it hasn’t already begun, it is ""likely to fall into recession by the third quarter of this year.""

Pence suggests review of how National Guardsman could've allegedly accessed high-level US secrets,"Moments before officials released the name of the suspect in their probe into top-secret intelligence leaks on an internet gaming forum, former Vice President Mike Pence said it was unbelievable that a state-level guardsman would have access to such information in the first place.

Pence told ""The Story"" he is concerned about the leak of the documents – which included movements of high-ranking officials, detailed Ukraine battlefield charts and potential trajectories of North Korean missiles directed at the U. S. – and called for the culprit to be prosecuted to the fullest extent.

""I'm just very concerned. And obviously we don't know among the documents that have appeared on the Internet, how many of them are real – The Pentagon seems to have made it clear that some of them are. Some of them may have been manufactured,"" he said.

""But again, I fall back to particularly now that we have a target here. I fall back on fundamental questions – and that is how could it how could a Massachusetts National Guardsman have access to this type of classified and sensitive information? And and how would they be able to release that information?""

At the time of Pence's remarks the only confirmed information about the suspect was that he was in the Bay State's militia, while moments later federal officials identified him as Jack Teixera, who was taken into custody in North Dighton, Mass.

Pence noted the sensitivity of the disclosed information, which he added included data on Chinese hypersonic missiles being tested and context about other countries, notably in the Arab world, potentially providing support to Russia – all of which he said could also jeopardize American agents and methods in the field.

""I think there needs to be a full scale review of who has access to this type of classified information and how it's being handled.""

PENCE SPEAKS OUT ON CLASSIFIED DOCS FOUND IN INDIANA HOME

Pence also responded to his former boss, ex-President Donald Trump, who commented on the state of the U. S. military. Trump told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" the Pentagon ""do[es]n't have any ammunition; we've given it to Ukraine [and] are not prepared to fight.""

The former vice president broke with Trump in that context, saying the U. S. is the ""arsenal of democracy"" and that the Reagan Doctrine prescribes that while Ukraine is ""not our war,"" if another country is willing to fight an American rival or enemy on their soil, they deserve the means to fight so that Americans don't have to battle them stateside.

""I'm proud of the historic increase in investments that we made in our national defense during the Trump-Pence administration. But the truth of the matter is, as the former president talks about planes and tanks that we helped build up in our military, we haven't sent one plane to the Ukrainian military. We haven't sent any tanks, even though the Biden administration promised to send 33 Abrams tanks back in January.""

Pence underlined Ukrainian troops' ""toughness"" and concluded the U. S. should stand with Kyiv so that they can ""reclaim their sovereignty.""

Instead, Pence faulted President Joe Biden for being ""slow in responding"" to the Ukraine invasion.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"Whitmer signs bill forcing stricter background checks, gun storage rules","Anyone who wants to buy a gun in Michigan will have to undergo a background check, and gun owners will be required to safely store all firearms and ammunition when around minors under new laws signed Thursday by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

The signing took place on the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing, where a gunman killed three students and injured five others two months ago. Flanked by students and gun safety advocates, Whitmer, a graduate of MSU, told the more than 100 people in attendance to ""buckle up, we’re going to continue this work.""

""Gun violence is a scourge that is unique to this country,"" Whitmer said. ""We don’t have to live like this and today, we are showing we are not going to anymore.""

MICHIGAN MASS SHOOTING PUSHES DEMOCRATS TO PRIORITIZE CHANGES TO GUN LAWS

The legislation is part of a sweeping 11-bill gun safety package that was introduced in the weeks following the MSU shooting but was predominately drafted after the 2021 Oxford High School shooting in which four students were killed. The bills saw little movement at the time with Republicans in control of the Legislature.

Gun safety advocates, who poured into the state Capitol on Thursday afternoon, cheered loudly from the gallery above the House chamber as Democrats voted to approve red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. The Senate passed the measures in March but will need to give final approval on several amendments before the bills are sent to Whitmer. The Democratic governor has said she would sign the package if and when it gets to her desk.

Extreme risk protection orders are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior to stop them from hurting themselves or others. An Associated Press investigation last year found that many U. S. states barely use the red flag laws.

Under the legislation signed Thursday, criminal background checks will be required for anyone buying a rifle or shotgun, which had previously only been required for purchases of pistols. The safe storage bills will require gun owners to keep unloaded firearms in a locked storage box or container when it is ""reasonably known that a minor is or is likely to be present on the premises."" The laws will go into effect next year.

Safe storage requirements gained momentum after Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 years old at the time, killed four classmates and wounded seven other people at Oxford High School. Afterward, he admitted to using a gun that was not locked in a box at home and had been purchased for him by his father. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, have been charged with involuntary manslaughter for the acts of Ethan, who has pleaded guilty to terrorism and first-degree murder charges.

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER SAYS TIME FOR 'ONLY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS' IS OVER, VOWS TO TAKE ACTION ON GUN VIOLENCE

Supporters have also said the safe storage requirements will protect teenagers from using firearms in suicide attempts.

Calling gun violence a ""uniquely American problem,"" Whitmer drew attention to mass shootings across the country during her remarks Thursday, specifically referencing recent shootings in Nashville and Louisville.

Numerous state legislatures across the country are debating ways to address gun violence. A shooting in downtown Louisville this week was the 15th mass killing of the year in the U. S. in which four or more people were killed other than the perpetrator. That is the most during the first 100 days of a calendar year since 2009.

The U. S. is sharply divided over what steps, if any, to take in the face of violence that involves firearms. Florida Gov.

"GOP hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy to call for shut down of ATF, expanded 2A rights in NRA convention speech","EXCLUSIVE: Republican presidential candidate and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy will call for the shutdown of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), as well as expanded Second Amendment rights for Americans, in his speech to the National Rifle Association's (NRA) convention in Indianapolis on Friday.

""The ATF is an agency beyond repair. I have already pledged to shut down the FBI and to rebuild a new federal law enforcement apparatus from scratch. This new apparatus can perform the function of background checks without creating a gun registry or shadow database - and I will shut down the ATF whose culture has become so toxic that it cannot merely be 'reformed,'"" Ramaswamy will say, according to a preview of the speech obtained by Fox News Digital.

Ramaswamy will also call for expanded Second Amendment rights for Americans, including making constitutional carry the ""law of the land.""

""I will support a national constitutional carry law that allows Americans to carry their firearms on their person, no matter what state you live in,"" he will tell the crowd.

Other parts of the speech will explain why he became a gun owner as a child of immigrants and after growing up in an ""anti-gun"" family.

""I’m not going to act like someone I’m not. I don't go hunting. Sport shooting isn't a hobby of mine. But I recently became a gun owner, and I’ll tell you why. It’s because the Second Amendment was made for times like today,"" Ramaswamy will say.

His speech will also contrast the ""fundamental difference"" in how the U. S. guarantees freedoms versus how countries like China and Iran guarantee freedoms, which he will say comes down to the Second Amendment.

""Tyrannical governments like China and Iran provide a valuable lesson: the key difference between talking about individual rights vs. securing individual rights is the 2nd Amendment,"" Ramaswamy will say.

DYLAN MULVANEY AND BUD LIGHT REVEAL THIS SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT THE GENDER INSANITY CULT

Ramswamy will detail sections of the constitutions of Iran and China that address the rights of its citizens and government overreach, and will also discuss how the infringement of Black Americans' Second Amendment rights following the Civil War played a role in the establishment of Jim Crow laws.

He will also liken the Second Amendment to the principle of ""Mutually Assured Destruction"" popularized during the Cold War concerning nuclear deterrence.

""Our Founders implemented the Second Amendment as our own form of ‘mutually assured destruction.’ We use this phrase in the context of the Cold War, when the U. S. and USSR, both armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, took great pains not to provoke the other,"" he will say. ""In America, the armed citizenry balances out the government and its military: it's the last bastion that deters the government from unconstitutional overreach.""

Ramaswamy will then argue that environment, social and governance standards, or ESG, and social credit systems are ""a new backdoor vehicle for the government to infringe on Second Amendment rights.""

VIVEK RAMASWAMY: I'm RUNNING ON MY VISION TO ANSWER WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN TODAY

""Social Credit Scores (SCSs) are used by Communist China to terrorize their political opponents.  Now, U. S. activists are pushing credit card companies and financial institutions to track and limit the purchase of firearms by lawful citizens using the same means,"" he will say

Ramaswamy will also call on the U. S. government to end such policies that he will say ""foster the growing ‘ESG’ cancer"" in our economy.

"Tim Scott supports national 20-week abortion ban, would consider 15-week limit","EXCLUSIVE – Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said there’s ""no question"" he would support a 20-week federal ban on abortion and would potentially consider a 15-week limit.

Scott, a rising star in the GOP and the only Black Republican in the Senate, made news early Thursday in New Hampshire as he told local TV station WMUR that if elected president, he would support a 20-week ban on abortion. He reiterated that position a couple of hours later in an interview with Fox News at a café in Manchester — the state’s most populous city — but went a step further.

""At least 20 weeks. There’s no question that I think the 15 weeks — there’s a lot of reasons for us to understand that, the viability,"" Scott told Fox News on his second day of campaigning in the crucial early presidential nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire after launching a presidential exploratory committee.

Abortion, always an important issue on the campaign trail, took center stage following the blockbuster move last June by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority to overturn the landmark nearly half-century old Roe v. Wade ruling, which allowed for legalized abortions nationwide. The decision by the high court moved the divisive issue of abortion back to the states. Last year, following the Supreme Court ruling, Scott’s GOP colleague from South Carolina, Sen. Lindsey Graham, proposed a 15-week federal ban on abortions.

FIRST ON FOX NEW: SEN. TIM SCOTT ANNOUNCES PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE

""There’s no question that the health of the child, the viability of the child, 20 weeks in my opinion is a no question. But the 15-week threshold is something that I believe is a place where you find a national limit that says ‘no more.’ States can do less. That’s got to be a state’s opportunity to do what they want to do.""

Taking questions from reporters after a stop at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, a longtime must stop for White House hopefuls from both major political parties, Scott criticized Democrats for being hypocrites on the abortion issue and took aim at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for suggesting at a Senate Banking hearing that participation in the workforce by African American women in poverty could be increased by having abortions.

TIM SCOTT TAKING NEXT STEPS AS GOP SENATOR MOVES TOWARDS 2024 RUN

""The most egregious form of restrictions are the lack of restrictions that our friends on the other side of the aisle have been voting for. They voted for late-term abortions up until the time of birth,"" Scott argued in his Fox News interview.

The senator charged that ""the most egregious form of this conversation gets so little coverage and so there’s no doubt that we have to find a threshold where we know that while the issue allows the states to be as aggressive or permissive as they want to be, I think there is the need for some kind of threshold that says we’re going to limit access to abortions for x number of weeks because we continue to see the rise of the far radical left wanting abortions up to the day of birth.""

And he emphasized that ""we can’t be a country aligned with North Korea and China,"" which allow abortions for any reasons even after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Scott, who’s co-sponsored restrictive abortions bills during his tenure in the Senate, including the 2021 Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which called for jail time for physicians who perform abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The senator, who’s reiterated when asked about abortion that he’s ""100% pro-life,"" on Thursday declined to answer when asked whether he would support legislation to prosecute doctors who performed late-term abortions.

Speaking with reporters, Scott declined to weigh in on whether medication abortions should remain legal, in the wake ruling this week by a federal appeals court that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone for now reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used, and said it could not be dispensed by mail. The Justice Department says it will ask the Supreme Court for an emergency order to put any action on hold.

""The courts are on their way to solving the problem,"" Scott said.

WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Democrats spent millions attacking Republicans over abortion ahead of last year’s midterm elections, and it was a contributing factor in turning the hoped for red wave by Republicans into a trickle. Democrats increased their razor-thin Senate majority by one seat, and while they lost control of the House, they kept their losses to a minimum. Democrats also won a number of crucial gubernatorial contests and flipped a handful of GOP controlled state house chambers. And Democrats last week won a crucial state supreme court election in battleground Wisconsin — where abortion was a top issue — by double digits.

On the eve of Scott's visit, longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley emphasized to reporters that the senator ""has supported some of the most extreme anti-choice legislation in Congress, including national abortion bans and legislation that could pave the way for banning forms of birth control.""

Scott has long highlighted his faith and has been a champion to social conservative voters, who overwhelming oppose abortion rights. He’s likely to heavily court evangelical voters, who play an outsized role in Republican politics in Iowa and his home state of South Carolina, which votes third in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

Among his stops on Wednesday in Iowa was a roundtable discussion with homeschool families. And following his visit to the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, Scott privately met with a group of pastors.

Asked if that’s his path to victory in the GOP nomination race, Scott told Fox News: ""I think my path to victory is just talking to people about commonsense. Commonsense conservatism works in New Hampshire as much as it does in South Carolina.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
NYC charter school to pay teachers $140K to promote student achievement,"A New York City charter school vows to pay its teachers $140K for the 2023-2024 school year.

The Equity Project Charter School [TEP] announced that they’re boosting teacher salaries to $140,000 for the 2023-24 school year, which is more than double the national average and significantly higher than the average salary for New York City public school teachers.

Prior to boosting teacher salaries, TEP was originally paying teacher salaries of $125,000 when it opened in 2009. That was almost twice as much as the average New York City public school teacher earned.

According to Teach For America [TFA], a teacher with 10 years of experience would earn a base salary of $86,280, and a maximum salary of $101,441. Teachers at TEP will also be eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to $35,000.

TWITTER DOESN'T LET RANDI WEINGARTEN GET AWAY WITH BLAMING TEACHER SHORTAGE ON 'CULTURE' WARS: 'LOST THE PLOT'

""Higher teacher salaries also help students. Knowing the profound effect teacher quality has on student achievement, a public charter school in New York City founded and led by TFA alums has made teacher pay a priority for 14 years,"" TFA reported.

According to TEP's website, 90% of TEP students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, which is a federal measure of poverty. TEP has 1080 students in kindergarten through 8th grade.

They also note that 91% of their students are Latino and 8% African American students.

""These teachers are valued in a way that matches the redefined expectations set for them: a $140,000 annual salary and the opportunity to earn a significant annual bonus based on school-wide performance,"" their website reads.

Since the pandemic, school districts across the country were struggling to fill hundreds of open teaching positions in the remaining weeks of summer before the 2022-2023 school year kicked off.

Since teacher pay has been a primary concern, lawmakers suggested legislation that would get rid of relicensing requirements for teachers when they move across state lines — an oftentimes cumbersome and costly process of waiting periods, licensing fees, and expensive exams.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNDER THE WIRE TO HIRE HUNDREDS OF TEACHERS BEFORE SCHOOL YEAR STARTS

The idea for an Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact was first proposed by the U. S. Department of Defense and is designed, in part, to support military spouses. It would effectively allow teaching licenses to be viable across members of the compact, cutting through the current 50-state patchwork of disparate requirements.

In 2020, Colorado paid teachers an estimated average of just over $60,000 annually, below the national average of about $65,000, according the National Center for Education Statistics, even though it's one of the most expensive states to live in. On those salaries, only about 20% of available homes in Colorado are affordable to teachers, according to a study by the Keystone Policy Center.

School districts across the country have been struggling with an exodus of teachers since the pandemic, as teachers reported burnout stemming from the uncertainty during lockdowns, including switching to remote learning, hybrid learning, and eventually transitioning back to in-class instruction.

TEACHERS' UNIONS PUSH DEMOCRATS TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE ON CRITICAL RACE THEORY

A survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 44% of public schools report having full- or part-time teacher vacancies.

The survey, published in March 2022, also found that 61% of public schools reporting at least one vacancy cited the pandemic for the open jobs. Most of the vacancies were due to resignations, not retirement, the survey reported.

About 300,000 public school teachers and staff have left the field between Feb. 2020 and May 2022, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A survey from the National Education Association in February found that 55% of teachers reported that they are thinking about leaving the profession, and 79% of teachers report dissatisfaction with their careers, according to a July American Federation of Teachers survey.

"GOP states rip AOC, Dems for pushing Biden to ignore abortion pill ruling","EXCLUSIVE — A group of Republican attorneys general is demanding that Democrats retract their suggestion that the Biden administration should defy a court order aimed at stopping the distribution of the abortion pill mifepristone.

Last week, a federal judge in Texas signed an injunction that directed the FDA to halt its more than 20-year-old approval of mifepristone while a lawsuit challenging its safety and approval works its way through court.

Democrats were incensed by the ruling, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y., who said that the Biden administration should ""ignore"" it. She said ""deeply partisan"" judges have ""engaged in unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts.""

""The interesting thing when it comes to a ruling is that it relies on enforcement,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN. ""And it is up to the Biden administration to enforce, to choose whether or not to enforce a ruling.""

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., issued a similar statement that called on President Biden and the FDA to ignore the ruling that he said has no ""basis in law"" but is ""rooted in conservatives' dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said on CNN last week, ""What you saw — by that one judge, in that one court, in that one state — that’s not America.""

Nine Republican AGs say those statements are so egregious, the Democrats need to retract them ""or resign.""

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, along with eight other Republican AGs who filed briefs in support of the ruling, sent a letter to those outspoken Democrats that scolded them for their statements, which they said are ""akin to a call to overthrow the Constitution.""

""This is the most anti-rule of law administration we’ve had in recent history. The fact that Becerra is even considering this means he should resign immediately,"" Bailey told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""Expressing mere disagreement with a court order, as all attorneys have done, is nothing like your call for the FDA not to comply with a court order. The difference between the two is enormous. For a party to defy a court order simply because one does not like it is an attack on our very system of government and the rule of law,"" the AGs stated in the letter exclusively reviewed by Fox News Digital.

HHS SECRETARY SAYS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IGNORING FEDERAL JUDGE’S ABORTION PILL RULING IS ‘ON THE TABLE’

""You ought to know better,"" the AGs wrote. ""Like each of us, you have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. Your anti-Constitution rhetoric is more than just wrong. It also erodes the culture of the rule of law that has taken centuries to build.

""Other nations have fallen into tyranny quickly when those who should have been upholding the rule of law chose instead to lead mobs against it. Your rash, inflammatory, anti-Constitution statements are unacceptable.

""You must retract or resign.""

On Wednesday, the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to keep mifepristone available only to be dispensed up to seven weeks, not 10, and not by mail, a decision that partially overturned the Texas ruling.

On Thursday, the Justice Department weighed in by asking the Supreme Court to issue a stay on the entire injunction issued by the Texas judge.

""The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v.

Top Peruvian politician gets 12 years for journalist's 1988 murder,"A Peruvian judge convicted retired army general and conservative politician Daniel Urresti and sentenced him to 12 years in prison Thursday for his role 35 years ago in the murder of a journalist who covered abuses during Peru’s civil war.

Hailed by advocates as an overdue but key verdict in upholding accountability and press freedom in Peru, the sentence represented a remarkable turnaround for Urresti, who has been an interior minister, congressman and presidential candidate as well as a frequent political commentator.

Urresti was a military intelligence officer in November 1988 when journalist Hugo Bustíos was machine-gunned and blown up with dynamite in a slaying initially blamed on the communist militant group Shining Path. A fellow journalist with Bustíos survived the attack.

Members of the military later were convicted of carrying out the ambush during a plainclothes patrol in Huanta province to prevent the journalist from covering news of military abuses against civilians in the largely indigenous region. The man who had been the local military commander was convicted in the attack in 2007, and he implicated Urresti as a member of that patrol in 2011.

Judge Juan Santillán issued the sentence Thursday in Lima as Urresti listened along with his wife and daughter, whom he hugged before being taken into custody by the police. Prosecutors had requested 25 years, but said they were satisfied with the decision. Urresti indicated he would appeal.

Sharmelí Bustíos, daughter of the murdered journalist and his late widow, told reporters that after 35 years, ""I can tell my parents that they can finally rest in peace.""

The National Association of Journalists said in statements on social media that the verdict was restitution both for the family of Bustíos and for journalism. ""It is an important step towards justice and the defense of press freedom in Peru,"" the group said.

Urresti was a popular interior minister in 2014-15 under President Ollanta Humala, with a reputation for being outspoken and taking a hard line against crime. He served in Peru’s Congress in 2020-21.

POLICE OFFICER IN PERU ATTACKED, BURNED TO DEATH AS MOB PROTESTS OUSTER OF PRESIDENT CASTILLO

The conviction against the politician came only after a second trial. He initially was acquitted in a verdict that was annulled in 2019 by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial saying that the previous process had been riddled with errors.

The Huanta province capital, also called Huanta, about 370 miles southeast of Lima, was one of the most violent cities during the war that raged between the Peruvian military and the Shining Path from 1980 to 2000.

Herminia Oré, who represents disappeared and tortured people of that city, told a journalist from The Associated Press in 2015 that there was an atmosphere of paranoia in Huanta during the conflict. ""A candle lit in your house at night was a reason for the military to arrest you,"" she said.

Cyprus probing residents involved in alleged Russian sanctions evasion,"Cyprus' government said Thursday it's looking into how a number of Cypriot nationals were included in a new round of U. S. and U.K. sanctions targeting the financial networks of Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Roman Abramovich who are close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides called an emergency meeting of top officials to investigate the involvement of three Cypriot nationals, three executives holding dual Cypriot-Russian citizenship, a Russian Cypriot-Israeli national and another resident of Cyprus who were among executives running Cypriot-registered trusts and other businesses involved in alleged sanctions-busting for Usmanov.

In a statement, government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said a number of decisions were taken ""for the exclusive purpose of protecting Cyprus’ name as a reliable, financial and business center.""

""The president of the republic considers the entire matter as particularly serious and has issued instructions to thoroughly investigate it,"" the statement said.

Cyprus has in recent years been at pains to shake off a reputation of being in the pockets of Russian oligarchs who have concealed their assets through a maze of Cyprus-registered trusts and brass-plate companies. Russian deposits in Cypriot banks have dropped precipitously since a 2013 financial crisis brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy.

Usmanov has been subject to U. S. and European Union sanctions since shortly after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine last year.

The Tunisian coast guard on Thursday recovered the bodies of 15 people trapped under the boat near the coast of Sfax, a port in east-central Tunisia, Sfax Prosecutor Faouzi Masmoudi told the Associated Press.

On Wednesday, the coast guard recovered 10 other bodies and rescued 72 migrants from the sunken vessel he said. The prosecutor estimated that 15 to 20 others who had been on the boat are still missing, based on survivors' accounts.

Supreme Court to debate employer accommodations for workers' religion,"A devout Christian's choice to put his faith above his job has put him at the center of constitutional fight that is now before the U. S. Supreme Court.

The justices will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a workplace discrimination appeal challenging the high court's 1977 precedent for determining an ""undue hardship"" on employers when accommodating an employee's religious beliefs and practices.

Mail carrier Gerald Groff sued the U. S. Postal Service after being disciplined for refusing to work on Sundays, when the evangelical Christian said he observes the Sabbath.

Groff says the policy violates his sincere conscience and that he endured a period of harassment and threats from supervisors.

THE POST OFFICE FIRED ME FOR HONORING THE LORD'S DAY. SUPREME COURT MUST MAKE THIS RIGHT

""The response by the Postal Service was brutal. I felt targeted for almost two years,"" Groff told Fox News Digital. ""Rather than respect my religious beliefs, the Postal Service chose to make an example out of me.""

The case is the second high-profile appeal over religious liberty to be argued before the Supreme Court this term, an issue where the 6-3 conservative majority has increasingly turned its focus.

Groff was employed as an auxiliary mailman in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, from 2012 to 2019, a continuous, part-time relief job that often is a first step toward work as a full-time regular carrier.

He believed the job would allow him Sundays off, as his lawyers indicated, ""by resting, worshipping with his church family, and serving his family and community.""

But a year after he began working, the USPS contracted with e-commerce giant Amazon to deliver their packages, requiring Sunday shifts for deliveries. After discussions with his supervisors, Groff says he was allowed to miss Sunday work, so long as he could personally find a replacement.

Initially, he was able to work out an arrangement with his supervisors to transfer to another branch that did not deliver on Sundays. When that branch also began Sunday deliveries, Groff was permitted to miss his shifts, but it became hard, especially during peak delivery periods, to find someone to cover for him.

First Liberty Institute, a Texas-based Christian conservative legal organization, is representing Groff and claims that the Postal Service subjected him to a letter of warning, two suspensions and other disciplinary measures.

Groff claimed hostile working conditions, which led to hair loss, chronic insomnia, weight gain and anxiety. Both sides disagree over whether his bosses made negative comments about his faith or his observance of it.

He resigned in January 2019, believing that he would be fired, and later sued.

""It is unlawful for employers to discriminate against employees on the basis of religion,"" said Kelly Shackelford, president of First Liberty Institute. ""It’s time for the Supreme Court to reconsider a decades-old case that favors corporations and the government over the religious rights of employees.""

Several religious groups are supporting Groff, including the American Hindu Coalition, National Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs and Council on American-Islamic Relations.

The Justice Department, which will argue the case on behalf of USPS, wrote in a filing, ""Despite the Holtwood Postmaster’s 'undisputed good-faith efforts' to find volunteers to cover petitioner’s Sunday shifts each time he was scheduled to work, petitioner ultimately missed at least 24 shifts that were not filled with shift swaps,"" during a 14-month period. ""In response, USPS took disciplinary measures, including imposing 'paper suspensions' that did not result in a loss of work or pay.""

Postal executives said Groff's absences created a ""tense atmosphere"" among the other small group of ""Rural Carrier Associates"" (RCAs), who began to complain about having to regularly fill in for him on Sundays.

The Postal Service said the nature of RCAs at the four-person post office was to work on an as-needed basis, with flexible hours that included weekend and holiday shifts.

""A union member working at the hub submitted a grievance in 2017, alleging that he had been forced to work on Sundays during non-peak season to cover for [Groff], in contravention of"" an agreement between USPS and the labor union representing RCAs, according to the federal government. Disciplinary measures against Groff then proceeded.

Several other labor unions, as well as 11 states, have filed briefs supporting the Postal Service.

SUPREME COURT TAKES UP RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CASE INVOLVING POSTAL WORKER WHO REFUSED TO WORK ON SUNDAY

Other groups opposed to Groff's lawsuit point to a ""statement of facts"" filed with the high court on behalf of both parties, in which Groff admitted he ""did not spend the whole day in church on Sundays. The plaintiff watched NASCAR on Sundays.""

A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled for the Postal Service, concluding Groff's absences ""placed a great strain on the Holtwood Post Office personnel and even resulted in the Postmaster delivering mail"" and ""also had an impact on operations and morale... and made timely [mail] delivery more difficult.""

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful ""to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s ... religion."" That includes ""all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s … religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.""

In 1977, the Supreme Court ruled that federal law requires employers to make good-faith efforts to accommodate an employee's faith, or show that in doing so, they would ""bear more than a de minimis cost.""

In that ruling, the court said TWA Airlines could dismiss an airport maintenance worker's refusal to work on the Sabbath, under Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines. That 7-2 opinion said the company and the labor union had taken ""reasonable"" measures to work out an accommodation with the worker, Larry Hardison, but said that TWA should not have to operate shorthanded or regularly pay premium wages to secure replacement workers.

Several conservative justices in recent years have questioned that precedent.

APPEALS COURT RULES AGAINST CHRISTIAN MAIL CARRIER WHO SUED USPS OVER SUNDAY SHIFTS

Justice Neil Gorsuch, in 2021, had urged his colleagues to revisit the issue, saying the 46-year-old ruling ""dramatically revised — really, undid— Title VII’s undue hardship test … [and that] the company had no obligation to provide [the employee] his requested accommodation because doing so would have cost the company something (anything) more than a trivial amount.""

""There is no barrier to our review and no one else to blame,"" said Gorsuch, who was supported at the time by Justice Samuel Alito. ""The only mistake here is of the Court’s own making — and it is past time for the Court to correct it.""

The high court will now get its chance.

It is a bedrock principle of the Constitution's First Amendment:  ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" Tension between those government and individual principles has been especially acute in the past six decades, as judges have been asked to ensure, when protecting one side, that they do not go too far in violating the other. The Supreme Court has interpreted such laws be enforced in a manner that is neutral toward religion.

That has led to a mixed record of sorts on a range of such disputes, and the justices often employ a default case-by-case determination. The high court has allowed some religious-themed displays on public property, while banning others. So, too, when it comes to legislative and school prayers; and taxpayer funds to religious organizations, even for secular purposes.

The high court, in 1971, established its three-prong ""Lemon"" test, named for one of the parties in the case. It embedded legal standards in the relationship between church and state.

But the approach has had its critics. The late Justice Antonin Scalia, in 1993, tweaked his colleagues for their ""wavering"" application of precedent.

""Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence once again,"" he wrote. ""It is there to scare us (and our audience) when we wish it to do so, but we can command it to return to the tomb at will.""

Justice Clarence Thomas was more succinct in 2011, saying the court's jurisprudence on church-state matters was ""anyone's guess.""

This is the second high-profile religious liberty dispute the high court is confronting this term.

The justices in December held oral arguments in a case brought by a Colorado web-designer, who seeks to expand her portfolio to include custom wedding celebration websites.

I’M A CHRISTIAN AND I'M SUING MY STATE BECAUSE IT REFUSED TO LET ME ADOPT CHILDREN

But in keeping with her religious tenets, she does not want to publish any such sites for gay or lesbian couples. Smith pre-emptively claims that she would be prevented by the state's anti-discrimination law from posting a disclaimer on her own homepage about those views.

The court's conservative majority offered qualified support for Lorie Smith during arguments, and a ruling is due in the next few weeks.

By wading again into a politically charged debate, the justices will have to confront recent decisions on religious liberty.

In 2019, a large concrete veterans memorial in the shape of a Christian cross on government property was allowed to stand. And this past June, a public high-school football coach who had prayed on the field after games in the presence of students was allowed to get his job back.

As Gorsuch wrote in the coach's case, ""The Constitution and the best of our traditions counsel mutual respect and tolerance, not censorship and suppression, for religious and nonreligious views alike.""

The current dispute over Gerald Groff's appeal is expected to draw a similar ideological divide, pitting individual constitutional rights against workplace accommodations.

""I hope the Supreme Court reaffirms our nation’s commitment to providing equal opportunity and fair treatment in the workplace,"" Groff told Fox News Digital. ""No employee should be forced to make the same decision the Postal Service forced upon me: faith or job.""

The Postal Service is an independent government agency that does not use taxpayer money for its operations.

The case is Groff v. DeJoy (22-174). A ruling is due by late June.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"These WWII heroes endured disease, starvation, torture. Here's why we should remember them","Editor’s note: On April 9, 1942, during World War II, approximately 10,000 American and 62,000 Filipino soldiers laid down their arms on the Bataan peninsula, Philippines, and became prisoners of war. Allied troops were rounded up and marched 66 miles up the peninsula toward prison camps in what became known as the Bataan Death March. The following is adapted from the forthcoming novel ""THE LONG MARCH HOME,"" written in tribute to the troops who were there.

Ten hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army attacked the Philippines.

For the next four and a half months, American and Filipino troops fought back with fury. Much of the Navy had been destroyed at Pearl Harbor, so without the support of ships, and with their backs against the sea, the troops in the Philippines were doomed to fight without reinforcements or new supplies. Courage abounded, but the troops were inexperienced, outgunned, and outmanned, and soon faced starvation and tropical diseases.

At last, Army Major General Edward King issued the unthinkable order to surrender on Bataan. On that dark April day, some 10,000 American soldiers and 62,000 Filipino soldiers dropped their weapons and were taken prisoner. It was the largest ever surrender of American troops. (A handful of Allied troops would keep fighting for another month under General Jonathan Wainwright on the tiny island of Corregidor, off the coast of Bataan.)

As a culture, Imperial soldiers had been indoctrinated to show no mercy for Allied soldiers, particularly those who surrendered. Random beatings, shootings, throat-cuttings and other unspeakable horrors left a trail of the dead. Although the exact count is lost in infamy, historians estimate some 6,000 to 10,000 men died on the march alone.

Some reached the destination: prison camps that became places of starvation, beatings, disease, and death. POWs were put on work details, often to bury dead bodies, carry water, or grow crops, but the resulting food benefited only enemy troops. Allied prisoners received some medical care, sporadically-delivered mail from home, and occasional Red Cross packages, but whether a man lived or died at the camps became anybody’s guess.

After enduring the prison camps of Bataan, some Allied prisoners were packed into freighters, which set out to cross to Japan, another kind of ordeal. Locked in the holds, with little food or water and no sanitation facilities, some men went insane in the ""Hell Ships,"" as they were called.

Some prisoners drowned. The Japanese ship, Arisan Maru, among others, gave no notice that prisoners were aboard. She was sunk by an American submarine and took down with her more American prisoners than had died at Camp O'Donnell. A rough count suggests that more than 5,000 Americans died when Allied Forces unwittingly bombed or torpedoed the hell ships.

For those who arrived on the mainland, life was no easier. Beatings, sicknesses, shortages, atrocities, and horrific methods of torture ensued as Allied troops worked in enemy war effort factories and hard labor camps.

By war’s end in August 1945, approximately one in three of Japan’s Allied prisoners of war did not make it home. For the men who had surrendered on Bataan and lived, it had been 41 months of pure hell.

The Philippines sets aside every April 9, called Day of Valor, or ""Araw ng Kagitingan,"" as a day to commemorate the valor of the Allied forces on Bataan. In the United States, April 9 has been called ""National Former POW Recognition Day"" since 1987.

Each spring, civilians and military personnel gather at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to commemorate the Bataan Death March. The memorial honors the heroic troops who defended the Philippines during World War II, who laid down their freedom, health, and often their lives.

May they never be forgotten.

The Post Office fired me for honoring the Lord's Day. Supreme Court must make this right,"My roots in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania run deep.  Growing up here it was rare to see businesses open on Sundays.  It was the Lord’s Day.  We spent the morning in church, the afternoon with family, and honored God by resting from our regular labor—something God commanded we do in the fourth of the Ten Commandments.

I never thought I would lose my job for honoring the Lord’s Day.

As I matured, I looked for jobs that would respect the Lord’s Day.  The United States Postal Service seemed a perfect fit.  Not only could I drive the rural routes of my boyhood, it famously did not deliver on Sundays.  I could have a good career and respect the Lord’s Day.

It was an ideal job until the Postal Service contracted with Amazon to provide Sunday delivery.  At first, we managed to find a workable solution: I would work every holiday that did not fall on the Lord’s Day and take extra route work on weekdays and Saturdays to make up for not working Sundays.

SUPREME COURT TAKES UP RELIGIOUS FREEDOM CASE INVOLVING POSTAL WORKER WHO REFUSED TO WORK ON SUNDAY

As much as I was able to accommodate the Post Office, stepping in to help other employees when they needed it most, the Postal Service would not accommodate me.  If I were a full-time rural carrier, it would be no problem.  Full-time carriers have enough seniority to be contractually exempt from work on Sundays.  If I had been willing to compromise what I believed and worked just a few Sundays, I would have reached seniority to get a full-time route and gone on to have a long career with the U. S. Postal Service.

It was either I violate God’s command to me and honor the Lord’s Day by keeping it holy or honor Him and trust Him with the outcome.  On the verge of my ideal career, I surrendered all my seniority, unwilling to sacrifice my hope of becoming a full-time carrier at the prospect of refusing God’s decree—even if it meant working just one Lord’s Day.

The response by the Postal Service was brutal.  I felt targeted for almost two years.  Rather than respect my religious beliefs, the Postal Service chose to make an example out of me.  Postal management sent me for eight different ""pre-disciplinary interviews"" at the main post office.  Each one took about two hours out of my work day, and I still had to finish all of my routes—and without overtime pay.

My employer purposefully assigned me more work than the same carriers I had been supporting every Saturday and holiday by working so they could have time off with family.  Without explanation or justification, USPS docked my pay.  If I had just compromised what I believed about the Lord’s Day—even just a handful of times—all of it would have gone away.  Compromising what we believe is never the right choice.

Surely an employer the size of the Postal Service could have found a way to accommodate a single employee’s religious beliefs.  Instead, it disciplined me so severely, it was quit or be fired.

Now, the U. S. Supreme Court will decide whether religious employees like me who work extra shifts, holidays, and cover for his colleagues deserve a religious accommodation in the workplace.  Only God knows the final outcome; I still trust Him even if my decision to honor the Lord’s Day cost me my career.

Our nation has a long history of protecting employees from being treated differently just because of their faith.  That is something woven into the fabric of our nation, including Lancaster County.  The heritage of respect and tolerance our nation has shown to the Old Order Amish and Mennonites who are my neighbors in Lancaster County is a lovely thing.  Yet the U. S. Postal Service refused to extend that religious tolerance to me.

I hope the Supreme Court reaffirms our nation’s commitment to providing equal opportunity and fair treatment in the workplace.  No employee should be forced to make the same decision the Postal Service forced upon me: faith or job.",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z
Muslims join the parents' rights battle over schools with these surprising results,"In a slap to Muslim girls at New York's famed Stuyvesant High School, the school is cancelling single-sex swim lessons, even though swim instruction is required to graduate. That forces the girls to choose between preserving their modesty and getting a diploma.

Count on Muslim families to fight back and likely prevail. Nationwide, Muslims are taking up the battle in schools to protect traditional religious values, including modesty.

Move over, Roman Catholics, evangelical Christians and conservative Jews. Reinforcements have arrived, and they're turning the tide.

Even in the Ivy League. After weeks of protests by female Muslim students, Yale University is switching its campus housing policy for the coming academic year to offer single-gender dorms and bathrooms.

From Michigan to Virginia, Muslim parents are showing up at local school board meetings to oppose graphic sex education and gender fluidity indoctrination. Their engagement is impacting politics. More Muslims are voting Republican, concluding that the Democratic Party is trampling Islamist values.

In Dearborn, Michigan, left-wing Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib opposed the Muslim parents in her district protesting sexually explicit materials in school.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration continues its lurch to the extreme left. President Joe Biden's Department of Education announced double-barreled rule changes last week, one favoring transgender athletes in elementary and middle school, and the other revoking a Trump-era commitment by the department to protect religious clubs and associations on college campuses. Flipping the bird to people of faith twice in a single week.

The Democratic Party is blowing off traditional values.

DEMOCRATS DEALT ANOTHER BLOW: THIRD LAWMAKER LEAVES PARTY, SWITCHES TO REPUBLICAN WITHIN A MONTH

Sexual modesty is a core value in Islam. Muslims observe a dress code and guard against physical contact between sexes once students reach adolescence.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects an employee's right to practice religion in the workplace, but there is no comparable statutory protection for students. Muslims are waging the battle one campus demonstration and school board meeting at a time, often winning.

Muslims are powerful at Yale. In 2021, undergrads elected a Muslim woman to be student body president. And on March 10, Yale acceded to demands from the Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Jews at Yale and other religious groups to provide single-sex campus housing. Muslim women students had protested that with men in the bathroom, they couldn't even remove their hijab.

Modesty is the issue at Stuyvesant High School, too. Brian Moran, assistant principal of physical education, told the student newspaper that the girls' single-sex swim classes clashed with other scheduling priorities. He made it sound like a mere scheduling inconvenience was justification enough for the change, and told the girls to wear full-body burkinis. Sorry, but those still cling to the body when wet.

New York City's Board of Education website promises trans students ""alternative arrangements"" for anyone with ""a need or desire for increased privacy."" Why should Muslim students get less? One in every 10 students in the city's school system is Muslim.

Last September, Muslim women at Syracuse University waged a battle for swim time without men in the college pool and won a concession that starts next fall.

In Utah, the Muslim Civic League worked with the Sikh and Jewish communities to pass a state law in February allowing school athletes to wear turbans, hijabs and modest pants and tops in competition instead of the regulation form-fitting uniforms.

Luna Banuri, the league's executive director, said: ""All faiths have modesty standards. We believe this affects multiple communities."" Maryland and Illinois recently passed similar laws.

In Bethel, Ohio, a coalition of Muslim and Christian parents are suing to preserve single-sex bathrooms and locker rooms and halt a rule change that would allow biological boys to use the girls' facilities.

Most Muslims still vote Democratic, but the shift is beginning. According to a Wall Street Journal exit poll, 28% voted Republican in the 2022 midterms, a double-digit increase over the 2018 midterms.

Putin and Xi seek to weaponize Artificial Intelligence against America,"An open letter recently signed by Elon Musk, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, and more than a thousand other prominent people set off alarm bells on advances in artificial intelligence (AI). The letter urged the world’s leading labs to hit the brakes on this powerful technology for six months because of the ""profound risks to society and humanity.""

A pause to consider the ramifications of this unpredictable new technology may have benefits. But our enemies will not wait while the U. S. engages in teleological discourse.

""By combining our wealth of research capacity and industrial capabilities, Russia and China can become world leaders in information technology, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence (AI),"" declared Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 21 during his meeting in Moscow with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two authoritarian leaders vowed to usher in a new, anti-U. S. world order, and as their joint statement noted a ""Deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination in the New Era,"" highlighted cooperation between Russia and China on AI.

AI is regarded as part of the fourth industrial revolution, which also includes the Internet of Things, genetic engineering, and quantum computing. Here is how America’s top adversaries, China and Russia, plan to weaponize this powerful tool against America.

CHINA WILL REQUIRE AI TO REFLECT SOCIALIST VALUES, NOT CHALLENGE SOCIAL ORDER

China codified its AI ambitions in the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which it adopted in July 2017. China had its AI awakening moment a year prior, according to Kaifu Li, ex-director of Google China. On March 19, 2016, Google DeepMind’s artificial intelligence program AlphaGo defeated South Korea’s Lee Sedol, the world champion in Go, the ancient Chinese game, in a highly anticipated match at the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul’s Gwanghwamun district. Most South Korean TV networks were covering the event as 60 million Chinese tuned in and 100,000 English-speaking viewers watched YouTube’s livestream. That a computer could beat the world champion shocked the Chinese. Sixteen months later, the Chinese Communist Party vowed that Beijing will lead the world of AI by 2030.

China’s AI strategy centers on three primary goals: domestic surveillance, economic advancement and future warfare. The Chinese government is already using AI-driven software dubbed ""one person, one file,"" that collects and stores vast amounts of data on its residents, in order to evaluate loyalty and risk to the regime. A giant network of surveillance cameras the Chinese authorities call ""sharp eyes"" tracks everyone continuously. Americans who travel to China, especially business executives and government officials, need to be aware of the risks associated with this blanket 24/7 monitoring.

When it comes to military applications, China’s strategic ambitions for AI are what the CCP calls ""intelligentized"" and ""informatized"" warfare. China’s Ministry of National Defense has established two research centers to execute this mission – the Artificial Intelligence Research Center and the Unmanned Systems Research Center. The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) tasked its Academy of Military Science with ensuring that the PLA’s warfighting doctrine is fully capitalized on disruptive technologies like AI and autonomous systems.

AFTER XI-PUTIN MEETING, TEAM BIDEN STILL DOESN'T GET WHAT'S JUST HAPPENED TO THE UNITED STATES

The United States is the primary target of China’s AI-enabled warfare doctrine, as it is the only country that stands in the way of China’s long-held policy goal of securing control over Taiwan. The CCP has decided that instead of following the track of U. S. military modernization, something Chinese military theorists view as linear trajectory, China will pursue ""leapfrog development"" of AI and autonomous technologies.

The PLA views AI technology as a ""trump card"" weapon that could be used in multiple ways to target perceived U. S. vulnerabilities, including U.S. battle networks and America’s way of war in general. An AI-enabled ""swarming"" tactic, for example is one of the approaches China could use to target and saturate the defenses of U.S. aircraft carriers.

AI swarming is a high-tech version of flooding U. S. airspace, in the run-up to an invasion of Taiwan, with hundreds of weaponized air balloons, of the kind that it recently flew across America. This would overwhelm the detection and defense capabilities of the U.S. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD.) How many F-22s and $400,000 AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles would be needed to down them all?

The speed of China’s progress in AI is of grave concern to the Pentagon and U. S. intelligence. In March, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency warned that China is ""investing heavily in its AI and ML [machine learning] capabilities.""

The 2023 Annual Threat Assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence characterized China’s AI and big data analytics capabilities as ""rapidly expanding and improving,"" saying China is on track to ""expand beyond domestic use."" China is already an ""AI peer in many areas and an AI leader in some applications,"" according to the 2021 Final Report by the U. S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The report warned that ""China’s plans, resources, and progress should concern all Americans"" and highlighted the importance of winning the ""intensifying strategic competition"" with China, which is determined to surpass the United States in the next few years.

Russia is lagging behind China and the U. S. in AI, but Moscow also seeks to become one of the world leaders in this novel technology. In 2017, Putin famously proclaimed ""whichever country becomes the leader in artificial intelligence will become the ruler of the world.""

In October 2019, Vladmir Putin approved Russia's ""National Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence to 2030"" and directed his Cabinet to report annually about the progress of its implementation. Last year, Putin escalated his prioritization of AI. ""Artificial intelligence technologies should be massively implemented in all industries in Russia this decade,"" he stated at the AI Journal Conference in Moscow in November 2022, urging Russia's researchers to ""create breakthrough technologies of a new era."" Russia's ""place in the world, sovereignty, and security"" depend on the results it achieves in AI, he said.

Russia’s AI strategy is primarily focused on robotics, robot-human interaction and counter-drone warfare. Russian military strategists believe that the expanding role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in modern warfare necessitates the development of ""UAV-killing UAV"" systems. AI is also viewed by Russian strategists as a perfect technology to enable Moscow’s doctrine of ""controlled chaos"" as a way of deterring Washington from intervening in a conflict, such as the one in Ukraine. The doctrine envisions the targeting of the U. S. homeland with AI-enabled crippling cyber-attacks and spreading false information that could cause panic and disrupt the normal functioning of the society.

Russian doctrinal writings talk about ""inspiring crisis"" in an adversary’s state by deploying AI-enabled cyber weapons and information operations in the run-up to a conflict. Using an ""artificially maintained"" crisis to trigger ""aggravating factors such as dissatisfaction with existing government,"" would create a destabilizing effect on the opponent, pointing their focus inward and away from what Russia is doing, hypothesize Russian strategists.

As U. S. leaders make decisions regarding America’s pace of development in AI, they must remember that Russia and China are not only accelerating the speed of their AI research, they also plan to join forces to make critical gains in it. The goal is to create a new anti-U.S. world order, destabilize the U.S. from within, and defeat America on the battlefield if necessary. Now is not the time to cede our competitive advantage in AI to our top adversaries.

"Texas hospital sees 30 infant deaths in 15-month period, warns parents of co-sleeping dangers","A single hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, reported that it has seen 30 infant deaths due to unsafe sleeping conditions since January 2022, according to a press release issued last week from Cook Children’s Medical Center.

The hospital is sharing the statistics in an effort to raise awareness of the dangers to babies posed by co-sleeping, as well as the dangers posed by blankets, pillows and other fabrics.

The babies were not born at Cook Children’s — but were transported there after the incidents or deaths.

OHIO WOMAN'S SECOND BABY KILLED 'AS A RESULT OF CO-SLEEPING': WHAT IS CO-SLEEPING?

The majority of the reported infant deaths occurred when a parent or caregiver slept in the same bed with the baby.

Other causes included ""infants asleep on a pillow with a bottle, in the crib with a blanket or pillow, in a recliner or couch next to a sleeping adult or wearing a loose-fitting T-shirt that covered her face,"" the press release stated.

The age group that experienced the highest number of deaths from unsafe sleeping conditions was 2 to 6 months old.

Sharon Evans, the traumatic injury prevention coordinator at Cook Children’s, said the 30 infant deaths over the past 15 months is the highest number she has seen since she joined the staff 15 years ago.

""We don't have to wait for it to happen in our home to be aware of the danger. We want them to understand that this is a very preventable situation,"" said Candle Johnson, a registered pediatric nurse at Cook Children's Renaissance Neighborhood Clinic in South Fort Worth, in the hospital’s press release.

""Let's be proactive today so we don't have to be reactive tomorrow. If a fatality occurs, how do we move forward when we could have prevented it in the first place?""

""Let's be proactive today so we don't have to be reactive tomorrow.""

Johnson has made it her mission to educate families on the dangers of co-sleeping — which is when the baby shares a bed with a parent or caregiver — and the importance of having the baby sleep alone in a crib, bassinet or other flat, contained surface.

PEDIATRIC EXPERTS GIVE NEW RECOMMENDATIONS TO KEEP SLEEPING BABIES SAFE

She said many women succumb to the temptation to have the baby sleep next to them or with them while breastfeeding.

""I advise against this practice because, although it may be easier, it is not safe,"" Johnson said in the press release.

""No one can control your bodily functions when you are sleeping. When you are in a deep sleep and your baby is next to you, you cannot say, ‘I am not going to roll over on him.’""

Other potential dangers include the baby suffocating under covers or pillows or getting trapped under the adult’s body or between the headboard and mattress, Johnson said in the release.

Fox News Digital reached out to Cook Children’s Medical Center for additional comment.

Approximately 3,400 babies every year die from unsafe sleeping conditions in the U. S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Some parents may face challenges that could put their babies at a higher risk of death from unsafe sleeping conditions, Johnson shared.

Those include lack of knowledge about optimal sleeping environments, financial hardship that makes it difficult to purchase a crib or bassinet, or a mistrust of medical advice, the press release stated.

Evans pointed out that in many cases, parents unknowingly may put their babies in danger.

""Parents want to do their best, but are often exhausted from feeding their babies at night and from other aspects of caring for a baby,"" she said in the Cook Children’s press release.

""Nobody does it intentionally. I don't think any of the parents who sleep with the baby think there could be any danger.""

Cook Children’s is just one of many hospitals that have seen the tragic loss of infant life due to unsafe sleeping arrangements.

Dr. Jenelle Ferry, a neonatologist and director of feeding, nutrition and infant development at Pediatrix Medical Group in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has experienced many cases of babies dying from unsafe sleeping situations, such as co-sleeping with a caregiver and being put to sleep with soft blankets — leading to suffocation.

""Sometimes a baby is able to be revived, but then suffers permanent severe brain injury from lack of oxygen, which may take away"" the baby's ability ""to ever learn to walk or talk,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Ferry said she's also experienced a case of co-sleeping in the hospital after a baby was born, which resulted in the infant falling out of the bed — and suffering a fractured skull and bleeding in the brain.

""These cases are heartbreaking because they can be prevented.""

""These cases are devastating because they involve babies so full of life and potential, but also because they involve loving and well-meaning parents who are usually exhausted and may not fully comprehend how something so seemingly simple could have such life-altering consequences,"" she said.

""These cases are heartbreaking because they can be prevented,"" Ferry continued.

Caregiver education is a critical part of preventing accidental infant death, said Ferry. This applies not just to parents, but also to babysitters and any other family members who will be caring for the infant.

""The hospitals I’ve worked in all have some degree of education on safe sleep,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""This should also be part of regular pediatrician visits.""

Ferry said parents should be educated about the importance of placing babies on their backs to sleep, keeping them in their own crib or bassinet on a firm, flat surface, and removing blankets and pillows from the sleep environment.

RECORD-BREAKING TWINS BORN FOUR MONTHS EARLY DEFY ODDS: ‘GOD WAS IN CONTROL’

Any other sleeping surfaces, such as portable cribs or other devices, should meet the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

In 1994, the National Institute of Child Health and Infant Development and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) launched the ""Back to Sleep"" campaign to spread awareness and prevention measures for sudden infant death.

It was later renamed ""Safe to Sleep"" to include a wider range of recommendations for reducing infant suffocation and promoting safe sleep.

Cook Children’s has launched its own Safe Sleep for Babies Council, which provides portable cribs and sleeping bags to families that need them.

Many parents make the mistake of thinking about an infant’s comfort in the same way they do their own, Ferry pointed out.

""While I may sleep more comfortably with a soft mattress topper and lots of blankets, I also have good head and neck control, can roll over and can remove a blanket from my face if it starts to interfere with my breathing,"" she explained.

With a baby, a similar environment will increase the risk of suffocation because he or she hasn’t yet developed. Only a tightly fitted sheet should be placed in a baby’s crib.

Instead of co-sleeping, the AAP recommends room sharing, which is when the baby’s crib or bassinet is kept in the room with the parent or caregiver.

Ferry said there are some safe tools available to help encourage good infant sleep, like swaddling blankets and sound machines that produce white noise to simulate the comforting sound of the womb.

MICHIGAN COUPLE WELCOMES 1ST BABY GIRL BORN INTO THE FAMILY AFTER 138 YEARS OF BOYS: 'UTTER SHOCK'

""A pacifier can be part of a safe sleep environment and has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of sudden infant death,"" she said.

The same safety precautions should apply outside the crib, too — when infants sleep with someone on a couch, cushion or soft chair, the risk of sleep-related death is up to 67 times higher, according to the AAP.

""Don’t leave infants sleeping on soft surfaces like couches or pillows unless they are directly supervised,"" Ferry said.

Instead of co-sleeping, the AAP recommends room sharing, which is when the baby’s crib, bassinet or play yard is kept in the room with the parent or caregiver.

This will make it easier to monitor, comfort and care for the baby while decreasing the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) by up to 50%.

The ""Safe to Sleep"" campaign focuses on the first year of life, as the highest risk for infant sleep-related deaths is in the first two to six months.

""As infants learn to roll over on their own, their risk of suffocation starts to decrease,"" Ferry told Fox News Digital.

""They should still be placed to sleep on their back — not their stomach and not their side — until one year of age, but if a baby rolls over on their own, the parents don’t need to worry about rolling him back over.""

Babies can start to sleep with a thin blanket after one year of age, she added.

New product acts as 'copilot for doctors',"America’s medical community appears to be embracing artificial intelligence products in an effort to speed up patient care and prevent burnout among health care professionals.

AI technology is already rolling out in doctors' offices, hospitals and clinics nationwide through a variety of formats.

California-based Regard has launched its AI product, a system that enables doctors to automate routine tasks, in 30 hospitals, its CEO said.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WON’T EVER BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THIS ONE THING

""What we started developing was essentially an AI copilot for doctors,"" Eli Ben-Joseph, co-founder and CEO of Regard, told Fox News.

The company’s software allows computers to diagnose a patient, assist with doctors' notes and alert professionals when something may have been overlooked.

The company told Fox News that the solution's ability to streamline workflows may allow doctors to spend less time on paperwork and administrative tasks.

AI AND HEART HEALTH: MACHINES DO A BETTER JOB OF READING ULTRASOUNDS THAN SONOGRAPHERS DO, SAYS STUDY

""We like to say it's almost like having an AI med student or an AI medical resident that helps the doctors with their day-to-day,"" added Ben-Joseph.

The AI medical industry is expected to grow significantly in the next several years.

The technology may save U. S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs on an annual basis, researchers found.

Separate studies, however, have indicated that the public remains cautious about embracing AI when it comes to medical care.

A survey published by Pew Research found that 60% of Americans would be ""uncomfortable"" with their health care providers relying on AI when administering services.

"Arizona is site of new Kirk Cameron, Sheriff Mark Lamb library book event","As he has been doing for many months now, actor and writer Kirk Cameron will be appearing at another public library in America this week, this time in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Friday, to share a love of country, family and faith along with others during a kid-friendly story hour event, Fox News Digital is told by Cameron's book publisher.

He'll be accompanied at the event by Sheriff Mark Lamb — who just announced a run for the Senate — as well as others.

""I can’t wait to visit family and friends in Arizona for our next Brave Books story hour,"" Cameron said in comments shared with Fox News Digital.

KIRK CAMERON AND HIS BOOK PUBLISHER OBJECT TO ‘INCLUSIVITY’ EDITS OF R. L. STINE BOOKS: ‘WOKEISM IS A VIRUS’

He added that Gov. Katie Hobbs is also invited to the event.

""You’re invited to the library as guest of honor,"" he said, speaking directly to the Democratic governor — ""and I’m reserving you a front-row seat.""

He continued, ""Spoiler alert: The kids will want you to sit Indian-style with them in the front row so you can join them in singing ‘God Bless America’ and maybe even lead us in a prayer. Please come.""

Brave Books, which published Cameron's book ""As You Grow"" as well as books by Sheriff Lamb and many others, told Fox News Digital it will start the event at the Scottsdale Public Library ""by having our patriotic time outside the library at 11 a.m.""

SHERIFF LAMB CALLS OUT ‘ATTACK ON TRADITIONAL VALUES,’ HAS A FIX FOR THAT

The group said it plans to say the Pledge of Allegiance, then ""sing the national anthem and pray outside the library.""

Said Sheriff Lamb in a statement, ""Protecting the innocence of children is vital to the preservation of the values this country was founded upon. This woke virus that seems to be spreading across our nation is coming after our kids.""

A Brave Books spokesperson told Fox News Digital, ""We need government officials to participate in the fruitful upbringing of the next generation. The American people look up to our representatives, and we must elect individuals that will stand up for values like love, joy, peace, patience, kindness and more.""

The book event is scheduled to be held at the Civic Center Library on N. Drinkwater Boulevard in Scottsdale on Friday, April 14, beginning at 11 a.m.

Local groups including Scottsdale Moms have listed the Cameron event for Friday on their websites.

KIRK CAMERON HOSTS STORY HOUR OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY AFTER PUBLISHER SAYS HE WAS DENIED SPACE INDOORS

CEO of Brave Books Trent Talbot said in a statement, ""We have a fight on our hands for the soul of the country. We all need to ask ourselves what we can do to preserve the Christian values this country was founded upon.""

He added that for his publishing team, ""that means making books that parents and grandparents can trust and taking back our libraries.""

On its Facebook page, Brave Books notes, ""Our goal is to instill pro-God, pro-America values, and biblical truths in every child’s heart, nurturing a strong foundation for their future.""

The library confirmed on Thursday morning in a phone call with Fox News Digital that the event is booked for its auditorium on Friday beginning at 11 a.m. through 2 p.m.

On its website, the library shares its mission statement: ""Putting People at the Heart of Dynamic Library Services."" The library also lists its values as the following:

* Plan and Innovate for the Future

* Show Caring and Compassion for Others

In a phone interview with Fox News Digital earlier this year, Sheriff Lamb said, ""We're seeing a real attack on traditional values in this country right now. We're seeing an attack on our children and an effort to educate them about things that most parents are not OK with,"" added Lamb, a father and grandfather.

""We're being fed things that aren't always what they appear to be.""

It is why, he said — in an effort to help educate America's children and ""be part of their lives in a positive way"" — he chose to write a children's book that teaches critical thinking skills.

The illustrated children's book published in January 2023 is entitled, ""The Adventures of Seymour Clues and Mr. Mouse: The Case of the Mysterious Sea Monster.""

The plot involves ""some local corruption,"" he said, as a ""mayor tries to instill fear into people. It isn't until [the characters in the book] do some critical thinking and ask some key questions that they're able to discover that things aren't what they were made out to be.""

Added Lamb, ""I think that is very applicable to today's world. We're being fed things that aren't always what they appear to be.""

Lamb on Monday declared his candidacy for the Senate in a statement filed to the Federal Elections Commission.

An outspoken critic of President Biden's immigration policies, Lamb has also earned recognition across Arizona and nationally for his opposition to the federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate in 2021 and his support of former President Donald Trump.

California man gets year in jail for threatening Merriam-Webster Dictionary publisher,"A California man who made violent anti-LGBTQ-related threats against dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster Inc. over its updated gender definitions was sentenced Thursday to a year in prison.

The sentence imposed on Jeremy Hanson, 35, by a federal court in Massachusetts also included 30 days of home confinement, three years of probation and mental health treatment.

Hanson pleaded guilty last year to interstate transmission of threatening communications in connection with threats made to the Springfield, Massachusetts-based dictionary publisher and to the president of the University of North Texas.

In court documents, prosecutors said the Rossmoor, California, man has a history of making ""threatening communications, nearly all of which were motivated by ... biases based upon race, gender, gender identity, and/or sexual orientation.""

Those other communications were directed at the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Land O’ Lakes Inc., Hasbro, a nonbinary rabbi and others, prosecutors said.

In a remote hearing Thursday, prosecutor Steven Breslow asked for an 18-month prison sentence, in part to serve as a deterrent to others at a time when violent rhetoric is becoming more common.

Hanson’s defense attorney, Marissa Elkins, asked that her client be sentenced to the time he has already served, citing his history of emotional and behavioral issues, including anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

More time behind bars could negatively affect his mental health, she said.

Judge Mark Mastroianni in U. S District Court in Springfield acknowledged Hanson's medical history and said he had no intent or capacity to carry out his threats, but called his actions ""disturbing and terrifying.""

He noted that Merriam-Webster management was ""fearful that Hanson would come to their office and cause harm,"" and said internal company communications referenced the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo offices in France, where terrorists killed 12 people who worked for the satirical weekly newspaper.

Hanson sent Merriam-Webster threatening messages and comments between Oct. 2 and Oct. 8, 2021 using the website’s ""contact us"" function, where he commented on word entries such as ""girl,"" ""woman,"" and ""female,"" prosecutors said.

""It is absolutely sickening that Merriam-Webster now tells blatant lies and promotes anti-science propaganda,"" Hanson wrote, according to prosecutors. ""There is no such thing as ‘gender identity.’ The imbecile who wrote this entry should be hunted down and shot.""

Twice he threatened to shoot and bomb company headquarters, prompting Merriam-Webster to close offices in Springfield and New York City for several days, prosecutors said.

Hanson also wrote an email to the president of the University of North Texas in 2022 that said ""You ought to be shot in the head and have your offices set on fire,"" for supporting transgender students, prosecutors said.

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET.

Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor.

A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers.

At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al.

GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE

While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future.

Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well.

One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor.

Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation.

Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits.

I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor.""

It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time.

Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing.

""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone.

But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands.

Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation.

Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught.

At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future.

Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark.

The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems.

I hope this first ""Turnabout Tale: helps us all to see the possibility in every young life and to recognize the responsibility we as adults have to nurture the light within them.

"As Passover ends, rabbi in Israel remembers family's experience during Holocaust","The holy celebration of Passover ends on Thursday night, April 14, 2023, at sundown.

Passover is the biblical festival of freedom that has ""inspired and encouraged"" those ""living under oppression"" for centuries, Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder of Israel365, an organization that offers educational materials and initiatives supporting the nation of Israel, told Fox News Digital.

""However, with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel being celebrated in just a few weeks, this Passover has new significance — at a very critical moment,"" said Weisz, who currently resides in Israel.

PASSOVER'S LESSONS TODAY MEAN MORE PERSONAL FREEDOM, NUCH LESS ‘ENSLAVEMENT,’ SAYS RABBI – HERE'S WHY

On Wednesday, April 5 (and Thursday, April 6, for those outside Israel), Jews gathered for the seder meal to ""reenact the ancient exodus from Egypt"" and repeat the family stories ""passed down from generation to generation,"" noted Weisz.

He said that his grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, again shared the dramatic story of her last seder with her family in Ukraine ""80 years ago, in 1943,"" he continued.

""Her father had already been taken to a concentration camp and her young mother was doing her best to lead the service for the six children,"" he also said.

""When they got to the part of the seder that called for opening up the door to symbolically welcome Elijah the prophet, two armed Nazis entered their home,"" Weisz said.

""I now live in Israel — and celebrating the holiday here, I have a new story that I tell my children at our seder.""

""Quick on her feet, my grandmother gave the soldiers the wine on the table, and they left the house.""

BALTIMORE RABBI: ALL AMERICANS ARE ENDURING A ‘WAVE OF HATE’ FROM TODAY'S PROGRESSIVE LEADERS

""Every year,"" Weisz said, ""my grandmother reminds her eight grandchildren and more than 30 great-grandchildren of the immortal words of the seder: ‘In every generation, they tried to destroy the Jewish people, but the Holy One Blessed be He, continues to save us from their hands.’""

He also said, ""Hitler killed six million of our people during the Holocaust, including many members of my extended family.""

""However, my grandparents were blessed to rebuild their shattered lives in the great United States of America and celebrate Passover in freedom.""

He continued, ""Yet, American Jews always knew that antisemitism could reappear, even in the United States, and we all conclude our seder by singing, ‘Next year in Jerusalem.’""

Weisz also said, ""I now live in Israel — and celebrating the holiday here, I have a new story that I tell my children at our seder.""

He added, ""Two thousand years ago, the Jewish people were living in Israel and celebrating Passover, not around their family dining room tables, but in the temple in Jerusalem.""

WHAT IS PASSOVER? EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE HOLIDAY

""Sadly, there was great discord among the different Jewish sects who fought endlessly with one another,"" Weisz said.

""When the infighting boiled over, the Romans entered Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and exiled the Jews to the four corners of the world.""

""Miraculously, we have now returned,"" he said. ""Since 1948, the Jews have been living in freedom and independence under a Jewish government.""

""Tragically,"" he said, ""political discord has recently once again crept into Jerusalem and our enemies are scheming all around us.""

As Israel prepares to commemorate its 75th anniversary, he added, ""the generation who was alive in 1948"" is dwindling and ""antisemitism is once again surging,"" Weisz said.

5 things you might not know about Academy Award-winning star,"As a comedian, musician, actor, filmmaker and father, Jamie Foxx is beyond a triple threat.

The 55-year-old actor earned top industry accolades and won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the 2004 film ""Ray,"" but Foxx has been performing nearly his entire life.

His daughter, Corinne Foxx, revealed Wednesday that Foxx suffered a ""medical complication"" the day before, and ""quick action and great care"" helped guide him toward recovery. His family has not disclosed Foxx's medical issue.

""Nothing further is being provided from the family at this time,"" Foxx's representatives told Fox News Digital Thursday.

JAMIE FOXX SUFFERS ‘MEDICAL COMPLICATION,’ DAUGHTER CORRINE SAYS: ‘HE IS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO RECOVERY’

Production crews in Atlanta reportedly shut down filming his latest project, ""Back in Action,"" Wednesday, but resumed on Thursday ""using a stand-in for Foxx on set,"" a source told People. A scene scheduled for Sunday has also reportedly been canceled due to ""changes in production.""

With more than 30 years of entertainment industry experience under his belt, here's a look at five things you might not know about Jamie Foxx.

He was a natural comedian and loved telling jokes from a young age.

Foxx was dared to perform at an open mic night, and he immediately fell in love with stand-up comedy.

""It was the most incredible feeling,"" he told Texas Monthly. ""It was, ‘OK, I think I know what I want to be right now.’""

He noticed that women were usually called to the stage first, so he changed his name to something more ambiguous and gender-neutral.

WILL JAMIE FOXX'S COMEDY ‘ALL-STAR WEEKEND’ SUCCUMB TO CANCEL CULTURE?' EXPERTS WEIGH IN

Born Eric Marlon Bishop, he became known as Jamie Foxx.

He picked the moniker as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx, a pioneer in the civil rights movement who found television success portraying Fred G. Sanford on ""Sanford and Son.""

On the ""Redd Foxx: We've Come to Join You"" podcast, Jamie discussed his name change as an ode to one of the greats.

""It was a tip of the hat to him that I chose that name, and the name stuck, and I have to be thankful to him for blazing the trail as a comedian and allowing me to sort of ride on his coattails,"" he said.

Jamie grew up in a religious household. He was adopted by his grandmother, Estelle Talley, when he was a baby after his biological parents rejected him.

JERRY SEINFELD RETURNS FOR ‘COMEDIANS IN CARS’ WITH NEW GUESTS JAMIE FOXX, SETH ROGEN AND MORE

Talley began taking Foxx to piano lessons when he was 5, and by the time he was 13, he was the musical director at a local Baptist church. He told Texas Monthly that he earned $75 each Sunday, saying, ""Church is big time!""

He continued to pursue piano throughout high school, which landed him a scholarship at the U. S. International University in San Diego, where he studied classical music and composition.

The keys also helped him with side hustles, and he sang in a ""terrible"" R&B band called Leather and Lace while in school.

With his career exploding with roles on ""In Living Color"" followed by his own sitcom, ""The Jamie Foxx Show,"" and then working in movies alongside Robin Williams in ""Toys"" and with Will Smith in ""Ali,"" Foxx got into the studio to show off his vocal range for his first album, ""Peep This.""

One decade later, he was featured on the 2003 Kanye West and Twista song, ""Slow Jamz,"" which reached No.1 on the Billboard 100, and then again with West on ""Gold Digger."" The hit included a Ray Charles-inspired hook of ""I Got a Woman,"" somewhat foreshadowing his future work with the acclaimed pianist.

JAMIE FOXX SAYS DIRECTOR ONCE CALLED HIM ‘HORRIBLE,’ KICKED HIM ‘THE F--K’ OUT

His second album, ""Unpredictable,"" was released in December 2005 and received Grammy nods, but it was his third album in 2008, ""Intuition,"" that turned the music world upside down.

""Blame It,"" featuring T-Pain, earned Foxx his first Grammy. He's been nominated a total of 10 times.

When ""Ray"" director Taylor Hackford approached Jamie about playing the role of the legendary musician Ray Charles in 2004, Hackford didn't know about Jamie's instrumental background and was blown away by Foxx's talent.

""Taylor didn’t know that I play piano, so he said, ‘I gotta figure out a way to shoot your face and then shoot somebody else’s hands playing.’ And I said, ‘No, no, I actually play. I’ve been playing since I was 5.’ That opened up a whole different thing,"" Foxx told the Jazz Times.

""Since I can play, we could stay in the same frame and shoot through the playing of the music and the singing at the same time, which was a huge plus.""

Foxx's world was turned upside down when his younger sister, DeOndra Dixon, died in October 2020. She was 36.

He wrote on social media at the time that his heart ""is shattered into a million pieces."" Foxx added DeOndra ""transitioned"" and said ""she will always be alive… anyone who knew my sis… knew that she was a bright light.""

Foxx continued, ""I can’t tell you how many times we have had parties at the house where she has got on the dance floor and stolen the show... even gave her boyfriend @chrisbrownofficial a run for his money... well I know she is in heaven now dancing with her wings on...tho my pain is unbelievable I smile when I think of all of the great memories that she left me... my family... and her friends.""

Jamie's sister danced in the ""Blame It"" video and also on the Grammys. He was proud of her accomplishments, especially becoming the ambassador to the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.

Shortly after her death, the foundation created the DeOndra Dixon Fund in her honor. Foxx told Extra two months after DeOndra died that their family was ""getting along"" as best they could.

""It was so much pain, man. My mother, my father and my sister, they all live with me. It was so much pain,"" he said.

The nonprofit sent a message of support to Jamie Thursday.

Dixon began participating in the Special Olympics in the sixth grade. She competed for nearly a decade and moved from her native Texas to California, where she lived with Foxx after graduating from high school in 2002.

""I feel I was born to dance. I want to be a professional dancer,"" Dixon’s foundation bio said. ""My brother has given me a chance to do some special things. I danced in his video ‘Blame It.’ I’ve danced on stage at some of his concerts all over the country. And guess what? I’ve danced at the Grammys!""

Jamie received an Academy Award for ""Ray"" the same year that he was nominated for best supporting actor in ""Collateral.""

He starred as a Los Angeles cab driver turned hostage by a hitman on a killing spree (Tom Cruise) in the neo-noir action flick directed by Michael Mann.

The star-studded cast included Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, and the film grossed more than $220 million at the box office. Months after its release, Cruise went public about his relationship with Katie Holmes.

Holmes and Cruise were married six years and have one daughter, Suri Cruise. They divorced in 2012.

Foxx and the ""Dawson's Creek"" star reportedly began dating in 2013 but kept their romance out of the spotlight for years.

They made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in 2019, six years into their relationship.

Weeks later, they were both single again.

Jamie helped Cameron Diaz come out of retirement with their latest film, ""Back in Action.""

The movie, which has been filming in London and Atlanta since September, marks Diaz's return to the silver screen after her last starring role in 2014 alongside Jamie in ""Annie.""

He tweeted an audio conversation with Cameron and retired quarterback Tom Brady in June.

""Cameron I hope you aren’t mad I recorded this, but no turning back now. Had to call in the GOAT to bring back another GOAT,"" Foxx captioned his Twitter post. ""Cameron Diaz and I are BACK IN ACTION - our new movie with Netflix. Production starting later this year!!""

Diaz and Foxx also starred together in the 1999 football flick ""Any Given Sunday.""

The long-awaited Mike Tyson biopic has been in the works for nearly a decade and was initially revealed as a feature film before taking on a TV movie structure. Tyson will serve as an executive producer with Foxx, in addition to Antoine Fuqua and Martin Scorsese.

Jamie will also work with Robert De Niro and Scott Eastwood in ""Tin Soldier,"" an action-thriller about the government's suspicions over a ""cult-like"" program for combat veterans.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Pentagon document leak has immediate impact on national security,"The leaked Pentagon documents will have a compounding effect of distracting officials from other, urgent topics of national security and will weaken allies’ trust in the country's ability to safeguard intelligence and operatives, experts told Fox News Digital.

""For the diplomats, this is going to take up a lot of oxygen that would otherwise be devoted to high priorities in our bilateral relations with many of the countries that are mentioned in these documents like South Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Israel,"" former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. ""We're going to be talking about this stuff.""

FBI agents arrested Massachusetts Air National Guardsmen Jack Douglas Teixeira at a home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, on Thursday in relation to a trove of classified documents that have been leaked online in recent months.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Teixeira, 21, is being investigated for the ""alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.""

James Anderson, former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, said that he fully expected ""many, many decades in a federal prison"" following a conviction, but that in the immediate aftermath, the U. S. needs to ensure that it restores ally confidence.

""It's important in the aftermath of this that there be a very thorough internal investigation as to what happened, and a congressional inquiry,"" Anderson said. ""That's what will be necessary to help convince allies and partners that we're doing everything in our power to try to prevent similar episodes from recurring in the future.""

""If we fail to convince them of our seriousness on this point, then they will be less likely to want to share sensitive intelligence with the United States government, and that would be most unfortunate,"" he added.

Hoffman highlighted the damage the leaks have caused to the CIA and intelligence assets out in the field, some of whom will have lost confidence in the U. S.' ability to protect their most sensitive information.

""Our sources, existing ones and those whom we hope to recruit, are going to wonder whether we can protect their information and their identities,"" he argued. ""Our people out in the field — my former colleagues at the CIA, even — have to reassure existing sources and potential sources that we can do that in spite of these leaks, and that's a that's not easy to do.""

""People are going to be taken off-line to deal with this counterintelligence flap, and the opportunity cost of that is they're not going to do other stuff they've got to deal with that is high priority, and that's not good for our national security, either,"" he added.

MARC THIESSEN ON CLASSIFIED DOCS LEAK: THE INCOMPETENCE IS ‘STUNNING’

Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, claimed that the disclosures could have a ""destructive impact"" on the country's ability to collect intelligence.

""It takes years to recruit human sources who are willing to betray their country and steal secrets from his/her country’s government and provide them to the United States,"" she explained. ""It takes years and billions of dollars to map out access to adversarial (or allied) networks and systems, in order to intervene in their communications,"" Koffler said.

""Now, some of these sources and channels will be patched up, closed and unusable by U. S. spy agencies. And massive amounts of taxpayers’ money will be wasted,"" she added. ""Overall, the impact of this leak is disastrous.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Black history in the U. S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.

Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.

Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE

The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U. S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.

From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.

Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.

Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.

Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.

By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.

Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.

Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850).

Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.

He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.

Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881).

Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.

Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.

She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.

Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more.""

Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS.

By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.

Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.

While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.

Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.

Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.

Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.

American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.

Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.

Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900).

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.

American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.

He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.

Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U. S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth.""

Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism.""

Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U. S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.

He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U. S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.

From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.

Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U. S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal.""

Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.

His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U. S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.

Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.

At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.

The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.

The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.

She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.

Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.

In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U. S. House of Representatives reports.

Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics.

Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U. S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.

She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.

Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.

He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.

King delivered his most famous speech, ""I Have a Dream,"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U. S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.

China faults 'negative impact' of US military drills for Korean Peninsula tensions,"A Chinese government official blamed the ""negative impact"" of military drills for tensions with North Korea after the firing of a ballistic missile which forced Japan to issue a warning to residents warning them to seek shelter.

Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said during a press conference on Thursday that U. S. military drills are causing current tensions between South Korea and North Korea.

""The current round of tension on the peninsula has its causes. The negative impact of the US military drills and deployment of strategic weapons around the peninsula is obvious to all,"" Wenbin said, according to Agence France Presse.

The North Korean military on Thursday launched a ballistic missile towards the sea which prompted Japan to briefly issue evacuation warnings for the Hokkaido island.

NORTH KOREA FIRED 'NEW TYPE OF BALLISTIC MISSILE' IN LAUNCH THAT SPARKED JAPAN EVACUATION WARNING: OFFICIAL

""Evacuate immediately. Immediately evacuate inside the building or underground,"" the warning on Thursday morning read. ""The missile is expected to fall around Hokkaido around 08:00. Please evacuate immediately.""

Japan Broadcasting Corporation, known as NHK, later posted a bulletin stating that the missile wasn't likely to fall in Hokkaido.

A South Korean military official said that the warning to ""evacuate immediately"" might have involved a ""new type of ballistic missile.""

""So far we assess that they fired a new type of ballistic missile with an intermediate or intercontinental range,"" the official said, according to Reuters.

In a statement, the White House said it ""strongly condemns"" the missile launch, stating that the test involved a ""long-range ballistic missile.""

""The President and his national security team are assessing the situation in close coordination with our allies and partners,"" National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple U. N. Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" Watson continued. ""This action demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people.""

"Who is Jack Teixeira, the Air National Guardsman behind leaked classified documents?","Investigators have taken an Air National Guardsman into custody in the case of leaked classified documents that shed light on the war in Ukraine and rattled the U. S. government.

Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old member of the 102nd Intelligence Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, is the leader of a small online gaming chat group where several classified documents have been leaked over the last few months. His identity was confirmed by Attorney General Merrick Garland on Thursday.

Teixeira joined the Air National Guard in September 2019 and was most recently stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base as a ""Cyber Transport Systems Journeyman.""

He held the highest-level security clearance granted by the government to review top secret information, according to an internal Department of Defense email reviewed by Fox News.

US DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN SAYS LEAKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS WERE 'SOMEWHERE IN THE WEB'

Cyber transport systems workers ensure that the underlying infrastructure of the Air Force’s global communications network is operating properly. Employees are required to have a high school diploma or GED, knowledge of electronics, experience in the installation of network infrastructure, and 7.5 weeks of basic military training.

Applicants are also required to pass a Single Scope Background Investigation, which is a government-wide investigation of those who need to access top secret material.

PENTAGON DOCUMENT LEAK HAS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY: SUCKS UP ‘A LOT OF OXYGEN’

The private Discord group that Teixeira led, Thug Shaker Central, comprised 20 to 30 mostly young men and teenagers who shared memes and talked about love of guns and video games.

A member of the group first posted hundreds of pages of intelligence briefings to the chat a few months ago, telling its members that it was important for them to stay up to date on world events.

Some members of the Thug Shake Central group defended Teixeira, arguing that the young Guardsman only posted the materials to the group in an attempt to spark discussion and keep friends informed.

""This guy was a Christian, anti-war, just wanted to inform some of his friends about what’s going on,"" a 17-year-old member of the group told The New York Times. ""We have some people in our group who are in Ukraine. We like fighting games, we like war games.""

SOUTH KOREA SAYS LEAKED PENTAGON DOCUMENT SUGGESTING US SPYING IS ‘UNTRUE’ AND ‘ALTERED’: REPORTS

Members of the group said the leaked documents didn't begin to receive attention until one member of the group posted some of them to a public online forum, where they were then picked up by Russian-language Telegram channels.

The members who spoke to The New York Times described Teixeira as older than most of the other members of the group and was the group's ""undisputed leader."" One of the members said he has known Teixeira for three years and met him in person, while another told the outlet that Teixeira had access to classified documents due to his role in the Air National Guard.

It is unclear how the young airman gained access to the documents and whether someone in his position and grade would have access to them.

Federal agents showed up to the Teixeira property in armored vehicles Thursday. About half a dozen armed agents wearing tactical gear spilled out and cordoned off the area around the home, eventually taking him into custody.

""Today, the FBI took 21-year-old Jack Douglas Teixeira into custody without incident at a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts, for his alleged involvement in leaking classified U. S. government and military documents,"" the FBI said in a statement.

""The FBI is continuing to conduct authorized law enforcement activity at the residence,"" the statement added. ""Since late last week the FBI has aggressively pursued investigative leads and today's arrest exemplifies our continued commitment to identifying, pursuing, and holding accountable those who betray our country's trust and put our national security at risk.""

In memory of World War II veteran Lester Tanner,"A simple flagged-draped coffin rested on the altar on Sunday, in a Jewish funeral chapel on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

It could be any of the thousands of funerals for a World War II veteran.

The honor guard, a lone soldier, solemnly walks down the chapel's center aisle, stands at attention at the head of the casket — and salutes.

Another soldier makes the same trek and stands at the foot of the casket.

The two of them fold the flag with careful precision.

One soldier presses the triangular folded flag to his chest, faces the family, hands them the flag and salutes.

Then he says, ""On behalf of the president of the United States — thank you for your service to this country.""

World War II vets are dying at an increased rate.

The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that by 2036, there will be only a few hundred remaining of the ""Greatest Generation.""

At a time when so many of them are leaving us, it's important that we not let their stories die with them.

Lester Tanner died last week. He was 99 years old.

At his service on Sunday, everyone talked about his incredible life, ordinary really — but full of the blessings that make life a joy.

A Harvard law degree, a thriving business, wife, children, stepchildren, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren with one on the way.

All of their lives touching other lives, bringing more lives into the world.

And it was all possible because nearly 80 years ago, one man was brave enough to stand in the gap and say, ""We are all Jewish.""

Tanner's story is entwined with the saga of Roddie Edmonds.

Tanner's story is entwined with the saga of Roddie Edmonds.

Edmonds was a master sergeant of the 106th Infantry Division, 422nd Infantry Regiment, in the United States Army during World War II.

He was the highest ranking officer at the Nazi's Stalag IX, a prisoner of war camp, that captured nearly 1,300 American soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.

The soldiers, some of them barefoot, had been marched brutally for miles in snow and cold.

Tanner and many others suffered severed frostbite, which made his feet scaly even decades later.

Tanner explained that in World War II, a man named Roddie Edmonds stood up for him. It became the defining moment in his life.

Edmonds never told his family about his experiences during the war.

His son Christopher, now a Baptist minister, was always curious.

Yet his father died in 1985 at age 65, never talking about his experiences in that POW camp.

But in 2008 an article appeared in The New York Times about Lester Tanner — who in 1980 sold his townhouse to former President Richard Nixon, after Nixon had been rejected from an apartment building because residents there didn't want him living near them.

He reached out to the Nixons and said they could buy his place.

In explaining why he, a Democrat, would be gracious to a disgraced Republican, Tanner explained that in World War II, a man named Roddie Edmonds stood up for him.

It became the defining moment in his life — and made him committed to doing the same.

Roddie Edmonds saved the lives of at least 200 Jewish soldiers. He also inspired bravery in all the men and gave them hope that they could survive the camp and return home.

And that's when he learned what his father had done.

In January 1945 in that POW camp, the Nazi commandant ordered Master Sergeant Edmonds to have all the Jewish soldiers fall out the next morning.

REAGAN LIBRARY IN CALIFORNIA WILL HOST HOLOCAUST IN NEW YEAR: ‘SO EMOTIONAL,’ SAYS SURVIVOR

It meant that the Nazis would separate them for extermination, Hitler's final solution.

Edmonds told the men the night before that they weren't going to do that.

The next morning, all of the nearly 1,300 American soldiers lined up. The 19-year-old Tanner stood at Edmonds' right, and another young Jewish soldier, Paul Stern, was on his left.

The commandant was incensed. He approached Edmonds and yelled, ""They can't all be Jewish!""

Edmonds answered, ""We are all Jewish.""

The commandment cocked his pistol and put it to Edmonds' forehead, threatening to kill him then and there if he didn't have the Jewish soldiers fall out.

Christopher Edmonds first met Lester in 2013. Their friendship inspired a book as well as a documentary.

Edmonds refused. He said to the commandant that even if he were to kill him, ""We know who you are, and you will be tried on war crimes.""

The commandant relented, put his pistol back in the holster and walked away.

That day, Roddie Edmonds saved the lives of at least 200 Jewish soldiers.

He also inspired bravery in all the men and gave them hope that they could survive the camp and return home.

Christopher Edmonds first met Lester in 2013. Their friendship inspired a book as well as a documentary.

""It was the greatest honor to know Lester.""

Christopher Edmonds spoke at Lester's funeral, saying, ""It was the greatest honor to know Lester."" And that ""Lester was treasure.""

He quoted Psalm 118 knowing that it was as an unlikely scripture at a funeral, but it told the story of Lester's life: ""This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.""

First, you're buying goods directly from manufacturers in China and other parts of the world. That's why shipping times are often much longer than on sites like Amazon. You might get your stuff in a week, but that could be more like 12 days.

For the most part, the prices are low because the goods are cheap. The pictures of what you see advertised may not be what you actually get.

Online reviewers seem to agree: Cheap is nice, but not when the quality is too shoddy to use. Temu’s BBB rating is 2.21/5. Reviews at TrustPilot are interesting, with 38% 5-star reviews and 41% 1-star reviews.

But that’s not the worst of it. As you shop, Temu collects lots of information.

Security boost: Simple mistake making your computer slower and less safe

Temu isn’t unique in all the info it wants to capture from your phone, of course. Most apps out there want as much as you’ll give up. But considering its ties to Communist China, the permissions seem even more frightening to me.

* The info you provide, like your name, address, and phone number.

* Details you enter, like your birthday, photo, and social media profiles.

* Your phone or computer’s operating system and version, your IP address, GPS location (if you allowed it), and browsing data.

They also gather more about you from third-party sources, including Temu sellers, public records, social media, data brokers, credit bureaus, and marketing partners.

Americans using Temu are selling the country out for bargains that really aren’t worth it. I say you delete it. Here’s how:

On iPhone, Long-press an app, then tap Remove App > Delete App. Tap Delete to confirm.

On Android, touch and hold an app, then tap Remove App > Delete App > Delete.

Still have TikTok on your phone? Here’s why it’s more complicated than fun viral videos.

While Temu collects a lot, it’s nothing compared to Pinduoduo. Remember, they are owned by the same company.

Cybersecurity researchers found it wasn’t just tracking device info and activity – malicious code allowed it to bypass cellphone security settings to spy on other apps, read notifications and messages, and even change settings.

PUTIN AND XI SEEK TO WEAPONIZE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AGAINST AMERICA

Temu gains full access to all your contacts, calendars, and photo albums, plus all your social media accounts, chats, and texts. In other words, literally everything on your phone.

Why? Company insiders told CNN that it’s a way to spy on users and competitors to boost sales.

No shopping app needs this much control, especially one tied to Communist China. If you’re using Pinduoduo, delete the app from your phone ASAP. It’s also reportedly hard to remove everything, even after you delete it.

Pro tip: If you downloaded Pinduoduo you really need to do a full factory reset on your smartphone to wipe out any remaining code or tracking.

"After Missouri veteran’s car is stolen by teen scammer, community rallies around 93-year-old","The community of Independence, Missouri, is rallying around a 93-year-old veteran whose last remaining asset — his car — was stolen by a teenager in a brazen act as the young person pretended to be interested in buying the vehicle.

""It was a gut punch,"" said Monte Nordeen, 38, who was helping his grandfather sell the SUV and had posted it on Facebook Marketplace.

""You’re just in total disbelief,"" Nordeen also told Fox News Digital. ""Time kind of slows down and you're like, ‘What just happened?’""

ARIZONA ARMY VET, 91, IS ROBBED OF $7K CASH WHILE PUMPING GAS. NOW, HIS COMMUNITY IS STEPPING IN

Nordeen and his father were helping Ret. Army Sgt. Bill Marsh sell his 2011 grey Dodge Durango.

They planned to meet the potential buyer at a centrally located public place with lots of cameras, to be safe.

The buyer suggested the parking lot of the Target store at E. 39th Street in Independence, where he said he worked.

""He was really polite. Even in the messages to me, he always said, ‘Drive safe,’ and ‘We'll see you soon’ and all these things — so you just completely have your guard down,"" Nordeen said. ""I’m thinking this is a really nice young man.""

After answering some questions about the vehicle — and letting the young man know that they were selling the car for their family member, a 93-year-old Korean War veteran — the pair agreed to let him test drive the car around the parking lot.

""My grandpa is a man of honor.""

They handed the man the keys and Nordeen started to open the door so he could get in and ride along with him.

""I went to reach for the handle and the door locked and the car sped off,"" Nordeen said. ""I looked up and I saw my dad standing across from me and my heart sank. I said, ‘Dad, he just stole Grandpa's car.’""

As they watched the car speeding down 39th Street, reality sank in.

TEXAS ARMY VET SURPRISED WITH TOWN PARADE FOR HIS 95TH BIRTHDAY: ‘I’M NOT A HERO, I JUST SERVED MY COUNTRY'

""I felt like I'd let Grandpa down,"" Nordeen said. ""I felt really bad for Grandpa, and I was just very angry … How could someone do that?""

They called the Independence Police Department — which arrived on the scene, searched the area and took the report. The suspect was gone.

Two weeks later, however, Officer Drew Wurtz recovered the car.

He was the same officer who responded to the theft on March 20, as Kelley Rupert, an Independence Police Department public information officer, told Fox News Digital.

In the ensuing police chase, the tires of the car were left shredded and his car was impounded by a tow company.

""The suspect is still in custody,"" said Rupert of the police department. ""He is a minor, so they are working on charges, but it looks like this is part of a ring and someone we have been dealing with for a while.""

In the time that the car was gone, financial worries took over. Marsh had been offering his car for sale in order to pay his property taxes on his house, which is on a reverse mortgage.

""My grandpa is a man of honor,"" Dorinda Stayton told Fox News Digital. ""He has lots of grit. This is a wonderful trait that all of us have inherited. We believe in earning a hard day's work and earning our keep.""

NEW JERSEY MAN WALKS ACORSS US TO RAISE NEARLY $100K FOR HOMELESS VETERANS: ‘RESPECT AND REVERENCE’

She added, ""And we have a lot of pride. We've never asked for money from anyone. That all started with Grandpa.""

Stayton said that at age 93, Marsh still enjoyed puttering around town in his Dodge.

""He loves his independence because he was a truck driver for many, many years,"" Stayton said.

""We pray that everyone would have goodness in their hearts. I even pray for the kid that got caught … I hope he turns his life around.""

""He would always joke that he could drive his 18 wheeler better in reverse than most people could drive a sedan going down the highway.""

Stayton set up a GoFundMe account for her grandfather, something she said she’d never done before.

Within just one week, the fundraising goal of $7,000 — which is what Marsh was asking for his car — was nearly reached.

""I just knew I needed to do something and that was where I ended up,"" Stayton said.

""It really took us swallowing our pride a little bit, being a little vulnerable and putting it out to the universe to see what might happen. We are just overwhelmed with all of the amazing people that are still in this world and who care,"" she also said.

When the owners of the tow company that had impounded the car heard Marsh’s story, they immediately offered to put new tires on it.

The body shop next to the tow company, Stayton said, also has offered to fix up the car and make sure everything is in good condition.

""We're honest people,"" Stayton said. ""We pray that everyone would have goodness in their hearts. I even pray for the kid that got caught. You know, he stole a dozen other cars. I'm glad that he's not doing this anymore. I hope he turns his life around.""

""We're looking to really bless the community in the way that they have blessed us.""

With the car now back in his driveway, Marsh and his family are making decisions about how to use the money that was raised for him, plus whatever money they make once the car is finally sold.

""Grandpa has some longer care needs,"" Stayton said. ""He's hard of hearing. He doesn't cook anymore. We were looking at some longer care solutions to keep him in his natural environment as long as possible. It's like this blessing is coming back twofold.""

Rupert of the Independence PD said she ""loves the way the community has stepped up"" to help Marsh.

""The reverse mortgage and the medical bills and everything else that this gentleman has on his plate, never mind the sacrifices that he made for all of us so that we could live the lives that we do today — this speaks volumes about Independence and its citizens,"" Rupert said.

Marsh’s family is already looking at ways they can pay it forward.

"Celine Dion makes acting debut, releases new music after Stiff Person Syndrome diagnosis","Celine Dion's heart will go on, in the form of making music and movies, despite her Stiff Person Syndrome diagnosis.

The Grammy-Award winner is making her debut on the big screen in the film ""Love Again,"" for which she also recorded a slew of new songs for the soundtrack. This will be Dion’s first release of new music since announcing in December that she suffers from the incurable neurological disease.

Dion, who will star as herself in the film, says she ""had a lot of fun doing this movie,"" which finished filming in early 2021.

""And to have the privilege of appearing with the beautiful and talented actors Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Sam Heughan in my very first feature film is a gift that I will cherish forever,"" she explained in a press release obtained by Fox News Digital.

""I think it's a wonderful feel-good story, and I hope that people will like it, and like the new songs too,"" she continued.

On Thursday, the studio released a lyric video for Dion's song that matches the movie title, ""Love Again.""

The film features 11 songs from the 55-year-old singer-songwriter, which are described as being ""woven into the narrative of the film and its characters.""

The romantic comedy follows Mira Ray (Chopra Jonas) who has just lost her fiancé. She ""sends a series of romantic texts to his old cell phone number…not realizing the number was reassigned to Rob Burns’ new work phone,"" a synopsis details. Rob Burns' is played by Heughan.

""A journalist, Rob is captivated by the honesty in the beautifully confessional texts. When he’s assigned to write a profile of megastar Celine Dion (playing herself in her first film role), he enlists her help in figuring out how to meet Mira in person … and win her heart.""

Chopra Jonas previously shared that the movie was ""our ode to Celine,"" and that ""having new music from her is such a blessing in this movie,"" according to People Magazine.

Heughan lauded Dion with compliments, saying she was ""very good,"" while also acknowledging her humor.

""Her music, in a way, brings my character and Priyanka's character together. But who better to do that than Celine Dion?"" he added.

In a video shared to her Instagram, Dion explained, ""While we're still learning about this rare condition, we now know this is what has been causing all of the spasms I've been having. Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I'm used to,"" she said.

""I'm working hard with my sports medicine therapist every day to build back my strength and my ability to perform again. But I have to admit it's been a struggle. All I know is singing. It's what I've done all my life. And it's what I love to do the most,"" she expressed.

""I miss you so much. I miss seeing all of you — being on the stage, performing for you. I always give 100 percent when I do my shows. But my condition is not allowing me to give you that right now. For me to reach you again, I have no choice but to concentrate on my health at this moment. And I have hope that I'm on the road to recovery. This is my focus.

Can artificial intelligence predict the weather months out? This company says it can,"Artificial intelligence is being used and introduced across all sectors, aiding the research of oncologists and NASA scientists.

Algorithms and machine-learning models, like the newly popular ChatGPT and Google's Bard, have helped students and professionals – although the technology comes with a warning as governments around the world rush to devise regulations and standards.

The potential of the industry and AI may appear to be boundless at this phase, with new research and tools publicly announced every week.

Just days after the Biden administration called for public input on proposed artificial intelligence policies, tropical cyclones are already a topic of discussion.

PENTAGON GOES ON AI HIRING SPREE TO BRING MACHINE LEARNING CAPABILITIES TO THE BATTLEFIELD

Severe and deadly weather ripped through communities in the South and Midwest and extreme flooding took southern Florida by storm on Wednesday, with nearly a foot of rain falling in just a matter of hours. Fort Lauderdale issued a state of emergency, and the forecast called for more rain on Thursday.

Meteorologists remarked on the extremity of the event.

One company, Weather 20/20, uses machine learning for long-range forecasting months out with a method it calls Lezak's Recurring Cycle (LRC).

Founded by retired Kansas City broadcast meteorologist Gary Lezak, the approach identifies cycles in the atmosphere's behavior over time that establish recurring patterns each year. Those patterns, the company says, can be used to project forward actual weather conditions over long windows of time.

""We use what actually happened to predict what is going to happen,"" it says. Key influences of the LRC include El Nino/La Nina patterns, harmonics and the Arctic and North Atlantic oscillation cycle.

While some in the field have questioned claims from Weather 20/20 and its founder's published work, admitting it has shown some efficacy to the Daily Beast in March, Lezak has answers for skeptics and those who say the theory of order in chaos would make long-range weather prediction impossible due to the sensitivity of initial measurements and small errors present in any meteorological prediction.

""We just don't have the computing [to eliminate these errors], nor are the physical processes represented perfectly,"" David DeWitt, the director of the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center, told the site.

In a podcast responding to the Daily Beast article – as well as in the article itself – Lezak pushed back, touting the Weather 20/20 results.

Ahead of the deadly weather in Mississippi last month, Lezak said the accuracy of a 65-day outlook ""predicted as good as the one-day or two-day outlook"" from the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, naming Mississippi as the target.

""And we didn't just take a stab and say, ‘Hey, right around March 20th and 25th there’s going to be one.' It's based on the LRC. You can go back, scientifically analyze the weather patterns and make a prediction based on the technology that we have,"" he said.

Weather 20/20 has made nearly a dozen predictions for the season, and Lezak says his model is a ""paradigm shift in meteorology.""

Lezak addressed concerns that such long-range forecasting could provide undue stress for affected areas, telling the Daily Beast there is an advantage in knowing ahead of time and in planning ahead.

The head of Baron Weather – which provides predictions and storm-tracking tools for government agencies and TV stations – has agreed with the success of Weather 20/20, and the two announced a partnership in February.

""Weather 20/20 has a successful track record for providing long-range guidance with respect to the geographic region and timing of significant weather risks,"" Baron Weather President and CEO Bob Dreisewerd said in a statement. ""Our business clients have a need for guidance beyond the typical 7-14 day forecast period and will find the forecast insights by Weather 20/20 very valuable in terms of long-range planning, risk mitigation and decision support.""

Lezak said he wasn't surprised that scientists doubt his work, knowing that it ""makes other scientists a little nervous,"" and agreed with the sentiment at the conclusion on the piece: Only time will tell how the LRC will fare.

Fox News Digital's request for comment from Weather 20/20 was not immediately returned.

Arnold Schwarzenegger filling a pothole sparks controversy within city of Los Angeles,"After being hailed a hero for filling in a pothole in his Brentwood, California, community, Arnold Schwarzenegger's good deed has not gone unpunished, with the city claiming he interrupted scheduled maintenance for a service trench.

A city spokesperson clarified that the location ""is not a pothole,"" but rather ""a service trench that relates to active, permitted work being performed at the location by SoCalGas, who expects the work to be completed by the end of May"" in a statement given to NBC Los Angeles.

A city spokesperson later told Fox News Digital that work began on Jan. 26 to ""upgrade the pipeline system on Mandeville Canyon Road,"" where temporary paving was applied. Standard procedure followed by SoCalGas includes permanently paving the area within approximately 30 days from the conclusion of work, however the city saw complications due to ""extraordinary wet and inclement weather."" The expectation now is that they will be finished by the end of the week.

A representative for Schwarzenegger believes the city is ""being careful with their wording to imply Arnold prevented their gas line work without directly saying it, because it's not true.""

AI-created malware sends shockwaves through cybersecurity world,"ChatGPT has caused a lot of buzz in the tech world these last few months, and not all the buzz has been great. Now, someone has claimed to have made powerful data-mining malware by using ChatGPT-based prompts in just a few hours. Here's what we know.

CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER

Forcepoint security researcher Aaron Mulgrew shared how he was able to create this malware by using OpenAI's generative chatbot. Even though ChatGPT has some protections that prevent people from asking it to create malware codes, Aaron was able to find a loophole.

He prompted ChatGPT to create the code function by function with separate lines. Once all the individual functions were compiled, he realized that he had an undetectable data-stealing executable on his hands that was as sophisticated as any nation-state malware.

This is incredibly alarming because Mulgrew was able to create this very dangerous malware without the need for a team of hackers, and he didn't even have to create the code himself.

HOW HACKERS ARE USING CHATGPT TO CREATE MALWARE TO TARGET YOU

The malware starts by disguising itself as a screensaver app that then auto-launches itself onto Windows devices. Once it's on a device, it will scrub through all kinds of files including Word docs, images and PDFs, and look for any data it can find to steal from the device.

Once the malware gets hold of the data, it can break the data down into smaller pieces and hide those pieces within other images on the device. The images then avoid detection by being uploaded to a Google Drive folder. The code was made to be super strong because Mulgrew was able to refine and strengthen his code against detection using simple prompts on ChatGPT.

Although this was all done in a private test by Mulgrew and the malware is not attacking anyone in the public, it's truly alarming to know the dangerous acts that can be committed using ChatGPT. Mulgrew claimed to not have any advanced coding experience, and yet the ChatGPT protections were still not strong enough to block his test. Hopefully, the protections are strengthened before a real hacker gets the chance to do something as Mulgrew did.

"Biden's ambitious EV plans could make US more dependent on Chinese supply chains, experts warn","President Biden's aggressive plans to push more Americans to purchase electric vehicles (EV) could significantly increase U. S. reliance on China, which currently dominates the mineral and battery supply chains.

On Wednesday, the White House unveiled sweeping tailpipe emissions standards for gas-powered cars made between 2027 and 2032, saying the toughest-ever rules of their kind would reduce carbon emissions by 10 billion tons over the next three decades. However, over the past decade, China has developed a strong foothold across the entire EV supply chain from mining and refining to battery production.

""China holds various percentages of dominance in various levels of the supply chain and various products, elements, etc.,"" Andrew Horn, a former senior official in the Office of International Affairs at the Department of Energy, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""But essentially, they either control indirectly or directly the mass majority of the global market, including what we in the U. S. consume.""

""They have, essentially, a massive chokehold over the entire market,"" said Horn, who also helped craft national critical mineral strategy at the White House. ""The U. S. right now has very minimal options.""

CCP-BACKED TECH COMPANIES ARE POISED TO CASH IN ON BIDEN'S CLIMATE BILL, NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS WARN

If finalized, the Biden administration's rules announced Wednesday would lead to 67% of new light-duty car purchases being electric by 2032 across the country. The emissions standards, which require automakers to achieve a 56% carbon emissions reduction in 2032 vehicles compared to 2026 models, are further expected to force nearly half of all new sedans to be electric within just four years.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), though, China produces about 75% of all lithium-ion batteries, a key part of EVs, worldwide. The nation also boasts 70% of production capacity for cathodes and 85% for anodes, two key components of such batteries.

CHINESE TECH COMPANIES ARE EXPLOITING US GREEN ENERGY GOALS, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WARN

In addition, more than 50% of lithium, cobalt and graphite processing and refining capacity is located in China, the IEA data showed. Those three critical minerals, in addition to copper and nickel, are vital for EV batteries. Chinese investment firms have also been aggressive in purchasing stakes in African mines, especially those rich with cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in recent years to ensure a firm control over mineral production.

""For the life of me, I can't understand why we would want to do this and subject ourselves to the Chinese Communist Party, which has said they want to supplant the United States as a global hegemony,"" Derrick Morgan, the executive vice president of the free market Heritage Foundation, said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""Why we would do this and play right into their hands has got me.""

""It's true that the U. S. is projected to increase our battery capacity 10 times, but once we do that, we're still going to be less than 10% of the world supply – even after we go up 10 times, assuming we can even do that,"" Morgan said. ""We'd have something like one-seventh or so the size of China's battery projection, even if all this new investment takes place.""

Horn, who in 2021 founded GreenMet, a private firm working to onshore critical mineral production, said nascent efforts to develop critical mineral and EV manufacturing supply chains in the U. S. and other Western nations will take more time and still face significant barriers from Chinese competitors.

""Those efforts are going to take a little bit of time to get up and running and fully be able to challenge some of the current Chinese dominance,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""And the Chinese get a vote in that. They're going to be watching this closely as they are now, trying to flood the market and do anything else they can with price manipulation, etc., to try and prevent competitors from coming online because it's obviously against their interests.""

BIDEN ADMIN ISSUES 20-YEAR MINING BAN AS IT TURNS TO FOREIGN SUPPLY CHAIN AMID GREEN ENERGY PUSH

Horn's company is currently involved in six critical mineral projects that it says will strengthen domestic supply chains.

However, permitting and environmental regulations have largely prevented the U. S. industry from gaining any traction in the global EV supply chain. For example, in 2022, the U.S. produced no graphite, less than .01% of global cobalt, less than .01% of global nickel, and about 6% of global copper, federal geological data showed. The U.S. processes virtually no copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium or rare earth minerals.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has moved to restrict large critical mineral mining projects across the country. In one instance, the Department of the Interior issued a 20-year mining ban in a northern Minnesota forest area home to about 88% of the nation's cobalt reserves and vast copper, nickel and platinum-group elements.

""The only winner here is China, as Joe Biden continues to hand our foreign adversaries every advantage possible,"" Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., the chairman of the House Natural Resources Energy and Mineral Subcommittee, said in January after the ban was issued.

And, on Wednesday, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., similarly said the administration's tailpipe emissions standards would primarily benefit China.

""This will hurt low-income families the most, while also making us more reliant on China for critical materials necessary for electric vehicles,"" she said in a statement. ""It’s a lose-lose for American families and for American security.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z
China's BYD built an electric supercar that can hop,"It's the first supercar that can actually fly. Well, hop.

China's BYD has revealed one of the eye-popping features its upcoming YangWang U9 supercar will offer.

Along with a 1,100 hp electric powertrain capable of accelerating it to 60 mph in just two seconds, the U9 has a hyper-active suspension system.

The BYD DiSus uses computer-operated air and hydraulic systems that can control each corner of the vehicle individually.

It hasn't released the details on how it works, but several videos demonstrate it in action.

In one, the car wobbles like Lighting McQueen having an animated conversation.

Another shows it riding along on just three wheels as the suspension keeps the corner without one from dragging on the ground. Then the entire vehicle gets off the ground.

The vehicle squats and leaps a couple of inches with all four tires in the air. It's not really a useful feature, but demonstrates the capability of the suspension.

Celebrate National Margarita Day with these sweet and savory cocktail recipes,"National Margarita Day is Feb. 22 — so what better way to celebrate than with a salt, lime and tequila?

Instead of celebrating the occasion with the same old tequila-and-triple-sec combo you’ve likely been slurping down for years, elevate the experience with one of the recipes below.

It takes two to mango margarita

Spice is nice, but sometimes it might be a little much, especially if indulging with a plate of chips and spicy salsa.

Sweeten the pitcher with watermelon juice and taste summer no matter what time of year it is.

Add all ingredients to a shaker. Shake and strain over ice into a rocks glass with a spice-salted rim. Use chili salt, chili powder, Tajin or crushed black peppercorns on your rim or sprinkled on your cocktail for an extra kick.

If you're looking for more of a winter-time margarita, use blood orange juice for your citrus.

The deep reds and oranges of the fruit pair well aesthetically with a black salt rim.

Add all ingredients (aside from salt) to a shaker.

Shake, then strain over ice into a rocks glass. Salt the rim first to avoid a spill.

Ed McFarland, the chef and owner of Ed’s Lobster Bar, hatched up this visually (and palatably) bright tequila-focused cocktail.

Pour all ingredients in a shaker filled with ice. Strain into a glass with crushed ice. Makes one cocktail.

For the blueberry juice: Mix 1 pint of blueberries, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 1 tablespoon of water in a saucepot. Heat on high to soften the berries. Once cooled, pass the berries through a strainer and chill.

This sweet and spicy concoction combines fan-favorite Arizona mango tea with hot sauce for an extra kick.

You can create this margarita in a pitcher blended overtop ice or on the rocks with a salted rim.

Combine ingredients in a blender. Blend until ice is smooth.

Do National Margarita Day in style with mild pear and earthy rosemary aromas. Add a pear twist to the margarita to create an Instagram-worthy cocktail.

Add tequila, Poire Williams and lime juice to a shaker with a few sprigs of rosemary. Shake with ice and fine strain. Pour into a coupe cocktail glass, garnished with a rosemary sprig and or pear twist.

If you like pina coladas this coconut-heavy margarita might be the one for you. Getting caught in the rain is purely optional, though.

Combine coconut cream and coconut milk in a shaker and shake thoroughly; pour remaining ingredients in and shake. Strain into glass and garnish with salt, if desired.

Get ready for a tropical vacation with this spring break margarita. This drink was the 2011 winner of Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville National Margarita Day recipe so it has to be good.

Place all ingredients into a blender cup, add ice and blend together until the consistency is smooth. Garnish this margarita with a pineapple wedge.

Cranberry cocktails aren't just for the Christmas season. Try this recipe from the Muy Bueno cookbook blog anytime of year.

The first step in making this drink is making your cranberry purée.

For the recipe, grab a saucepan and melt sugar in the orange juice over medium heat. Add in cranberries and cook all of it together over low heat for about 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let it cool.

Taylor Swift fans slam Nick Cannon after he jokes that he would 'absolutely' have a baby with the singer,"Taylor Swift fans vented their fury on social media after Nick Cannon joked that he would ""absolutely"" have a baby with the singer.

The 42-year-old entertainer, who is already a father to 12 children with six different women, made the remarks during an appearance on ""The Howard Stern Show"" while discussing whether he was still open to having more kids.

""If I said to you, ‘Nick, Taylor Swift wants to have a baby with you.' Would that do it?"" Stern, 69, asked Cannon on Monday's episode of his SiriusXM radio show.

""Absolutely, I'm in! Let's go,"" ""The Masked Singer"" host quipped. ""That's the one. I'm all in!""

""What is it about her?"" co-host Robin Quivers asked.

""First of all, she's an amazing songwriter and what I do love about Taylor Swift is the fact that she has been so open and vulnerable with all of her music since she was a young girl,"" Cannon replied.

The ""All That"" alum jokingly added that he and Swift both have experience with dating in the spotlight.

""Me and Taylor's numbers are very similar when we're talking about being in these streets,"" Cannon said with a laugh. ""I think she would relate to me very well based off of like, 'Yo, you've dated a lot of people in the public eye, so have I.' We would probably really understand each other.""

Stern then noted that the ""Blank Space"" hitmaker had reportedly split from her boyfriend Joe Alwyn after six years of dating.

""You know I know that, Howard! My Spidey-senses is tingling,"" Cannon joked.

""I would love it if you had a baby with Taylor Swift,"" Stern said. ""I think it would be fantastic.""

""Me too!"" Nick exclaimed while laughing. ""I think it would be amazing.""

The television personality shares 11-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan with his ex-wife Mariah Carey. Cannon shares sons Golden, 6, and Rise, 5 months, and daughter Powerful, 2, with Brittany Bell.

Abby De La Rosa and Cannon are parents to daughter Beautiful, 3 months, and twins Zion and Zillion, 1. The former ""Wild N' Out"" host shares 7-month-old son Legendary with model Bre Tiesi and daughter Onyx, 5 months, with LaNisha Cole.

Cannon and Alyssa Scott shared late son Zen and welcomed daughter Halo, 2 months, in December.

Swift, 33, is reportedly newly single after she and Alwyn, 32, recently called it quits. According to ""Entertainment Tonight,"" which was first to report the news last weekend, ""it was not dramatic,"" and was an ""amicable"" split.

""The relationship had just run its course. It's why [Alwyn] hasn't been spotted at any shows,"" a source told the outlet.

Some of the 12-time Grammy Award winner's fans were not amused by Cannon's comments, which they slammed as ""misogynistic,"" ""rude"" and ""gross"" on social media.

One social media user wrote, ""I have a really great sense of humor but this ain't it. In fact it's gross that this would even be a topic and something said out loud. Respect women.""

""Imagine if he'd said that The Rock can now carry his baby, or Jason Momoa,"" tweeted another user. ""He wouldn't, right? Even if they could carry babies. And it's because a man won't violate another man's bodily autonomy without expecting a fight. But a woman? Available to every man, right? No consent?""

""Taylor Swift has been single for one day (publicly) and already s----- men are seeing her as an available womb. That's what we're talking about when we're talking about reflexive straight cis male misogyny.""

One fan wrote, ""Nothing has ever showcased Nick Cannon's disgusting misogyny quite like him publicly saying he wants to impregnate a famous stranger. I can't fathom thinking that was an okay thing to say, even if it's a 'joke'. Like wtf.""

Add these heart-healthy foods recommended by experts to your grocery list,"February is American Heart Month. Of course, it’s a good idea to eat a nutrient-dense diet year-round — but this month, here are some foods that are especially a boon for your cardiovascular health.

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Moreover, the cost of treating cardiovascular via health care services and other medicines is approximately hundreds of billions per year.

Hundreds of thousands of individuals die from heart disease annually, with one person dying every 34 seconds, according to the CDC. Some of the leading lifestyle factors for the disease include obesity, lack of physical exercise and an unhealthy diet.

SHOULD YOU RAISE YOUR CHILD AS A VEGAN OR A VEGETARIAN? NUTRITIONISTS WEIGH IN

Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and other foods, such as poultry, are the backbone of a healthy diet to avoid cardiovascular illness. In early February, across the United States, individuals wear red on National Wear Red Day to highlight the importance of combating heart disease.

It’s time to load up on spinach, kale, collard greens and other dark, leafy greens.

This recommendation comes from Isa Kujawski, MPH, RDN, founder of Mea Nutrition LLC, who after serving for over 10 years of active duty in the Navy and losing her veteran brother to suicide dedicated her career to helping people use food as medicine.

""Dark leafy greens are a powerhouse of beneficial nutrients, including fiber, micronutrients and bioactive plant compounds known as phytochemicals,"" said Kujawski, citing a 2018 scientific review paper published in Nutrients.

THESE ARE THE WORST FOODS FOR YOUR HEALTH, EXPERTS SAY

""These nutrients presumably protect against cardiovascular disease by various mechanisms, including altering gene expression, regulating blood pressure, and lowering inflammation in the body,"" she added.

""Myriad studies have demonstrated the association between intake of dark leafy greens and lower risk of cardiovascular disease.""

Erin Kenney, MS, RD, LDN, HCP, CPT, registered dietitian and CEO of Nutrition Rewired, is all about incorporating olive oil to your diet to keep your ticker happy.

""Olive oil consumption, specifically the extra-virgin, is associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and mortality in individuals at high cardiovascular risk,"" she said.

""Olive oil is rich in healthful antioxidants, polyphenols and vitamins, and is a good source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats,"" she continued, adding that to get the most benefits from olive oil, avoid heating the oil and instead use it in a salad or add it to a homemade hummus.

EAT THESE FOODS TO LIVE A LONG LIFE, EXPERTS SAY

In case you needed another excuse to eat more guacamole, here it is. Avocados are high in monounsaturated fats, according to Amy Adams, RDN, LDN.

""Monounsaturated fats increase our LDL (‘bad’ cholesterol) clearance rate, meaning our body gets rid of them faster. Higher LDL levels can be detrimental because LDL brings cholesterol to the heart,"" she explained.

""One study done by the Journal of the American Heart Association found that overweight/obese individuals who consumed more avocados had the ability to significantly lower their LDL cholesterol when compared to overweight/obese individuals who ate a low-fat or moderate-fat diet.""

OLIVE OIL CAN CUT RISK OF DISEASE, HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, STUDY SAYS

Echoing Adams, Kenney said that adding an avocado to your daily diet may help lower bad cholesterol, in turn reducing risk for heart disease, according to health researchers at Penn State.

""Avocado contains healthy monounsaturated fats in addition to potassium and magnesium, both of which help to maintain a healthy blood pressure,"" she said.

""Berries, such as blueberries, blackberries and raspberries are high in fiber, antioxidants and phytonutrients, all of which work to lower oxidative stress and inflammation in the body,"" said Kujawski, pointing to a 2010 study in Nutrition Reviews. ""These processes improve blood pressure, vascular function, and fight free radical formation. Consequently, clinical studies have shown that berries contribute to lower cardiovascular disease risk.""

""Blueberries have been singled out as being a standout food when it comes to improving heart health.""

Kristi Ruth, RD, LDN, Carrotsandcookies.com, stressed the importance of eating more fresh fruits and vegetables in general to improve heart health.

""This will increase your intake of fiber and a variety of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and more,"" she said.

""Still, blueberries have been singled out as being a standout food when it comes to improving heart health,"" she continued, noting they are high in antioxidants, including anthocyanin, which is a flavonoid, a group of phytonutrients or plant chemicals that are incredible for heart health.

""Beans are a heart healthy food which consist of fiber and a variety of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. They improve the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammation, and promoting digestive wellness,"" said Kujawski, highlighting research published in the peer-reviewed journal Nutrients.

""Beans are rich in soluble fiber, which acts as food to beneficial gut bacteria to promote a healthy gut flora, which is an important factor in overall heart health.""

Adams is also all in for Team Bean. ""Beans contain plant sterols/stanols. Plant sterols/stanols work as active compounds in our body that are very similar in structure to cholesterol,"" she explained.

""Consequently, plant sterols/stanols compete with cholesterol for absorption in the small intestine. Overall, this causes less cholesterol to build up in our bloodstream. One study showed that eating 2-4 grams of plant sterols/stanols per day can reduce cholesterol by 10%.""

""Salmon contains omega-3 fats which have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause mortality in patients with known coronary heart disease,"" said Kenney.

""These essential fats help by reducing inflammation in the body. If you don't like salmon, you may get the same benefits from a supplement based on a meta analysis that found fish oil omega‐3 supplements lowered risk for heart attack and death from coronary heart disease.""

Kenney recommended aiming for two to three servings of salmon or other high-fat fish, like herring, anchovies or mackerel, per week.

Think barley, oatmeal, brown rice, millet, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, and more.

""While refined carbohydrates get a bad reputation for their negative impact on health and increased risk of heart disease, whole grains have the opposite impact,"" said Kristin Gillespie, MS, RD, LD, adviser for Exercisewithstyle.com.

""These grains, which are incredibly nutritious as they contain all parts of the grain, are heart protective. Many studies have demonstrated a relationship between whole grain consumption and heart health.""

""Grape skins contain resveratrol, a powerful polyphenol. Polyphenols are compounds found in plants, which have been shown to benefit the human body. More specifically, resveratrol is part of the stilbenoid family. Stilbenoids are a natural compound produced by certain plants in response to injury. The purpose of stilbenoids is to protect the plant,"" said Adams.

""Similarly, resveratrol has been shown to protect the cardiovascular system,"" Adams added. ""Several studies have determined that heart disease can be linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial damage. Resveratrol has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, stimulate endothelial production of nitric oxide, and inhibit vascular inflammation.""

These crunchy, mildly sweet nuts are a boon for heart health.

""Out of all nuts, walnuts are special because they have the highest percent of omega 6, omega 3, and polyunsaturated fats which are cardioprotective,"" said Adams.

""One study done by The New England Journal of Medicine evaluated whether walnuts consumption affected lipid levels and blood pressure. During the study, 18 healthy men in two different diets, with one group having 20% of their calories coming from walnuts. Each diet was followed for a total of four weeks. In conclusion, participants consuming more walnuts reduced total levels of cholesterol by 12.4%, reduced LDL (or ‘bad’ cholesterol) by 16.3%.""

Walnuts are also a research-backed food to support cognition and brain health.

Flaxsed is ""one of the richest plant sources of omega-3 fat(ALA), which is excellent for heart health,"" said Ruth, citing research in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.

She also commented that flaxseed is high in fiber and lignans (a phytochemical), and that both of those things are thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Thanks to the fiber content, flaxseed is helpful with digestion, too.",2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z

Zwerner, 25, stood with her twin sister, brother and mother as she was given a framed resolution commending her for her devotion to the safety of her students after the shooting at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News on Jan. 6.

Police have said that after Zwerner was the last one to leave the classroom and collapsed in a school office. No one else was hurt.

Zwerner spent two weeks in the hospital. She has since had four surgeries and is still recovering from wounds to her hand and chest. No one else was hurt.

""She truly is one of Virginia’s great heroes, and I have enormous admiration for her,"" said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, a Republican.

Last week, Zwerner filed a $40 million lawsuit against the school system, accusing school officials of ignoring multiple warnings from teachers and other school employees that the boy had brought a gun to school on the day of the shooting.

Zwerner's lawsuit also alleges that school officials knew the boy ""had a history of random violence,"" including an episode when he ""strangled and choked"" his kindergarten teacher.

On Monday, a grand jury indicted the boy's mother on charges of felony child neglect and misdemeanor endangering a child by reckless storage of a firearm. The child used his mother’s 9 mm handgun to shoot Zwerner. Police say the weapon was purchased legally.

Prosecutors have also filed a petition seeking a special grand jury to investigate whether the ""actions or omissions"" of any school employees could lead to criminal charges.

Missing Alaskan dog miraculously returns home after dangerous 150-mile trek on the frozen Bering Sea,"A 1-year-old Australian shepherd took an epic trek across 150 miles of frozen Bering Sea ice that included being bitten by a seal or polar bear before he was safely returned to his home in Alaska.

Mandy Iworrigan, Nanuq's owner who lives in Gambell, Alaska, and her family were visiting Savoogna, another St. Lawrence Island community in the Bering Strait, last month when Nanuq disappeared with their other family dog, Starlight, the Anchorage Daily News reported.

Starlight turned up a few weeks later, but Nanuq, which means polar bear in Siberian Yupik, was nowhere to be found.

'INSEPARABLE' DOG, GOAT DUO TO LIVE OUT REST OF DAYS TOGETHER ON FARM

About a month after Nanuq disappeared, people in Wales, 150 miles northeast of Savoonga on Alaska’s western coast, began posting pictures online of what they described as a lost dog.

""My dad texted me and said, ‘There’s a dog that looks like Nanuq in Wales,’"" Iworrigan said.

She reactivated her Facebook account to see if it might be her wandering hound.

""I was like, ‘No freakin’ way! That’s our dog! What is he doing in Wales?’"" she said.

The events of Nanuq’s journey will likely always be a mystery.

""I have no idea why he ended up in Wales. Maybe the ice shifted while he was hunting,"" Iworrigan said. ""I’m pretty sure he ate leftovers of seal or caught a seal. Probably birds, too. He eats our Native foods. He’s smart.""

THIS EASTER, NASHVILLE STEPS UP FOR COVENANT SCHOOL FAMILIES, MAKING EASTER BASKETS FOR EVERY STUDENT

Luke became involved with the organization alongside his parents in 2020, who came in to help Mesler and her team fill Easter baskets.

Luke started assembling the baskets with help from his mother, Beverly Flerlage, but by the end of his first year volunteering, he was able to start building baskets on his own, Mesler shared.

Mesler said he went home and told his parents that ""he wants to help more kids smile,"" so Luke started finding ways to bring in thousands of supplies.

Luke father, Mike Flerlage, reached out to Mesler on behalf of Luke – sharing his desire to increase the efforts, Mesler added.

In 2022, the Flerlage family filled multiple cars worth of different toys and gifts for the baskets that would go out that year.

After that season, Luke wanted to collect even more Easter basket goodies.

Over a root beer float, Mesler and Luke devised a plan for Easter 2023.

This time, Mesler provided Luke with a box truck, and he was determined to fill the entire vehicle with supplies.

""He spoke to everyone he knew and everyone he met and said, 'I'm collecting things for Alleluia Baskets, we're helping kids smile on Easter,'"" Mesler shared.

A friend of the Flerlages ran a pumpkin patch in the fall of 2022, and the proceeds from the patch were used to buy this year's supplies for Alleluia Baskets.

He is conscious of the mission to bring joy to others at Easter.

On March 27, 2023, the box truck arrived and with the help of nearly 50 volunteers, all 12,221 items were unloaded from the vehicle.

""It was a very sweet, beautiful act of love,"" Mesler commented.

Luke's parents said their kindergartner's heart is ""as big as he is.""

""He likes seeing [the volunteer effort] grow, getting bigger every year. And most of all it makes people happy and smile,"" Beverly Flerlage told Fox News Digital.

Luke already has plans for next year's basket-filling event and he's looking forward to hosting a kid's trivia night in September. All the proceeds from trivia night will go towards Alleluia Baskets, Mesler said.

Album returned to Toronto Public Library nearly 41 years after its due date,"A vintage vinyl album has made its way back to its home library more than 40 years past its due date.

The Toronto Public Library shared a tweet on April 6 showing the album cover and the original library card, with a due date of Oct. 5, 1982.

The album made its way back to the Spadina Road Branch in Toronto, Ontario.

NEW JERSEY MAN RETURNS BORROWED BOOK TO HIS PUBLIC LIBRARY 75 YEARS LATE

The music album, ""Tanzmusik der Praetorius-Zeit: Dance Music from the Time of Praetorius,"" by Fritz Neumeyer, was released in Hamburg, Germany in the 1960s, according to an Ebay auction that was selling the same album.

The classical 12-inch LP was released by the record label Archiv Produktion, as seen on Ebay.

""Good thing we eliminated late fines last year,"" the library staff wrote on Twitter.

""I wonder how much it would have cost in late fees?"" one user commented.

""But [the] penalty if that card was missing is 25 cents. Priceless,"" another person shared.

On March 31, 2022, the Toronto Public Library eliminated late fees in the hope of ""removing a barrier to access and making the library more welcoming to all,"" the library shared in a press release.

""When customers have fines, they are less likely to use the library and take advantage of the wide variety of materials and services, including free wifi, quiet study and workspace, programs for all ages and opportunities for civic engagement and participation.""

OREGON LIBRARY RECEIVES OVERDUE BOOK RETURNED DECADES AFTER IT WAS CHECKED OUT

While the library has done away with late fees, those who have lost or damaged an item — or who do not return an item — are still required to pay for its replacement cost.

The library claims that fines actually ""create a barrier"" for those who hope to use the different services at the library.

Florida nurse pleads guilty to replacing fentanyl with saline,"A nurse who previously worked at a Florida outpatient surgical center has been convicted of stealing fentanyl and replacing the powerful pain medication with saline.

Catherine Shannon Dunton, 54, pleaded guilty Tuesday to tampering with a consumer product in Fort Pierce federal court, according to court records. She faces up to 10 years in prison at a June 27 hearing.

According to court records, Dunton worked from September 2021 to April 2022 as a circulating nurse at The Surgery Center at Jensen Beach, about 45 miles north of West Palm Beach.

Center employees performing an inventory noticed the missing drugs, and video surveillance was used to identify Dunton as a suspect, officials said.

Beginning in February last year, prosecutors said Dunton took vials of fentanyl and injected it into herself. To avoid detection, she replaced the narcotic painkiller from nearly 450 vials with saline solution, and then returned the adulterated vials to the center for use during outpatient surgical procedures, investigators said.

Prosecutors had arranged for a Food and Drug Administration anesthesiologist to testify that surgery patients receiving diluted fentanyl was not safe. Inadequate pain control can also lead to an elevated risk of heart attack or stroke in vulnerable patients, officials said. Also, tampering with the vial presented a risk of contamination, which could lead to infection during or after the surgical procedure.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"Heart disease risk could be affected by one surprising factor, new study finds","The shape of a person's heart could be a predictor of future cardiac disease, a new study from Stanford University in California found.

Specifically, a heart that has a more spherical (round) shape could have a 47% higher likelihood of developing cardiomyopathy, which is a ""disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body,"" according to the Mayo Clinic.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze more than 38,897 MRIs of healthy hearts from the UK Biobank, researchers examined a large biomedical database that includes information from 500,000 U. K. participants.

HEART DISEASE, THE SILENT KILLER: STUDY SHOWS IT CAN STRIKE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS

In the study, published in the journal Med on Wednesday, the researchers measured the roundness of the left ventricle, a typically cone-shaped chamber of the heart that pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.

Next, the researchers analyzed the participants’ health records to identify which ones had certain genetic markers for heart conditions.

They found an overlap between the rounder-shaped hearts and a predisposition for heart disease.

""Most people who practice cardiology are well aware that after someone develops heart disease, the heart will look more spherical,"" said Dr. Shoa Clarke, a preventive cardiologist and an instructor in the Stanford School of Medicine’s departments of medicine and pediatrics, in a press release announcing the findings.

Clarke was one of the study’s senior researchers, along with Dr. David Ouyang of the Smidt Heart Institute of Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.

The lead author was Milos Vukadinovic, a bioengineering student at UCLA.

The research team was surprised by the strong link between heart roundness and the risk for future cardiomyopathy, Clarke told Fox News Digital.

""It was possible that heart shape may not have told us anything different than measurements of heart size or strength,"" he said.

""But it turned out that heart shape provides additional information about risk and genetics that is not picked up by other measurements.""

Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, said that when used properly, AI can be ""a clinician’s friend"" when evaluating heart health.

5 SIMPLE WAYS TO HELP PREVENT HEART DISEASE THIS YEAR

""In this instance, AI appeared to show a correlation between roundness of the heart and development of cardiomyopathy, where the heart balloons out and is a less effective pump,"" Dr. Siegel told Fox News Digital.

""This makes some sense, because the heart is typically more oblong,"" he explained.

""A rounder shape could conceivably put more stress or pressure on the valves and walls, potentially leading to this outcome."" He was not involved in the new study.

If the new study is confirmed, it would add another element to how cardiologists examine patients' echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart), said Dr. Siegel.

The researchers believe this is just the tipping point for much more data-rich information from MRI imagery.

""A key takeaway of our work is that current strategies for assessing the heart are good, but they were established decades ago, before the era of big data,"" Clarke told Fox News Digital.

""When used properly, AI can be a clinician’s friend.""

""We now have the opportunity to think more broadly and ask what other features of the heart can tell us about the risk and the biology of disease.""

Co-author Ouyang told the journal Med that there is an extensive amount of untapped information that physicians aren’t currently using.

The study authors indicated that more research is needed into how heart shape can or should be considered when making medical decisions.

Pentagon document leak has immediate impact on national security,"The leaked Pentagon documents will have a compounding effect of distracting officials from other, urgent topics of national security and will weaken allies’ trust in the country's ability to safeguard intelligence and operatives, experts told Fox News Digital.

""For the diplomats, this is going to take up a lot of oxygen that would otherwise be devoted to high priorities in our bilateral relations with many of the countries that are mentioned in these documents like South Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Israel,"" former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. ""We're going to be talking about this stuff.""

FBI agents arrested Massachusetts Air National Guardsmen Jack Douglas Teixeira at a home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, on Thursday in relation to a trove of classified documents that have been leaked online in recent months.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Teixeira, 21, is being investigated for the ""alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.""

James Anderson, former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, said that he fully expected ""many, many decades in a federal prison"" following a conviction, but that in the immediate aftermath, the U. S. needs to ensure that it restores ally confidence.

""It's important in the aftermath of this that there be a very thorough internal investigation as to what happened, and a congressional inquiry,"" Anderson said. ""That's what will be necessary to help convince allies and partners that we're doing everything in our power to try to prevent similar episodes from recurring in the future.""

""If we fail to convince them of our seriousness on this point, then they will be less likely to want to share sensitive intelligence with the United States government, and that would be most unfortunate,"" he added.

Hoffman highlighted the damage the leaks have caused to the CIA and intelligence assets out in the field, some of whom will have lost confidence in the U. S.' ability to protect their most sensitive information.

""Our sources, existing ones and those whom we hope to recruit, are going to wonder whether we can protect their information and their identities,"" he argued. ""Our people out in the field — my former colleagues at the CIA, even — have to reassure existing sources and potential sources that we can do that in spite of these leaks, and that's a that's not easy to do.""

""People are going to be taken off-line to deal with this counterintelligence flap, and the opportunity cost of that is they're not going to do other stuff they've got to deal with that is high priority, and that's not good for our national security, either,"" he added.

MARC THIESSEN ON CLASSIFIED DOCS LEAK: THE INCOMPETENCE IS ‘STUNNING’

Rebekah Koffler, president of Doctrine & Strategy Consulting and a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer, claimed that the disclosures could have a ""destructive impact"" on the country's ability to collect intelligence.

""It takes years to recruit human sources who are willing to betray their country and steal secrets from his/her country’s government and provide them to the United States,"" she explained. ""It takes years and billions of dollars to map out access to adversarial (or allied) networks and systems, in order to intervene in their communications,"" Koffler said.

""Now, some of these sources and channels will be patched up, closed and unusable by U. S. spy agencies. And massive amounts of taxpayers’ money will be wasted,"" she added. ""Overall, the impact of this leak is disastrous.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
'Unruly' pro-abortion protesters removed from Florida House gallery after throwing debris at lawmakers,"Pro-abortion protesters gathered at the Florida State Capitol on Thursday were forced out of the House gallery after they interrupted proceedings and began throwing debris at lawmakers who were deliberating a measure that would ban abortions after six weeks.

The incident took place as the Florida House of Representatives debated and voted on amendments to Senate Bill 300, an abortion bill that successfully passed in the state Senate earlier this month.

""The Speaker just ordered the Sargent at Arms to clear the gallery after protestors started throwing things at lawmakers,"" Spencer Roach, a Republican who represents the Sunshine State's 79th House district, wrote in a tweet.

Roach's tweet included footage of the protesters standing outside the chamber chanting, ""No justice, no peace.""

""These abortion-on-demand activists will not intimidate or deter us from protecting the unborn,"" Roach wrote in another tweet.

Speaking to Fox News Digital about the incident, Roach said protesters had become ""unruly"" in the gallery and were removed after being ""reprimanded"" for disturbances as the lawmakers debated the amendments.

""He gave a warning and said, 'The next time it happens, I'm gonna clear the gallery,' and it happened again. He ordered the sergeant of arms to clear the gallery,"" Roach said. ""Clearly, they were prepared for this moment and this was their plan all along. They started throwing debris and some papers down on the floor on lawmakers.""

Roach said the behavior from the pro-abortion protesters ""does expose a vulnerability"" in the fact that lawmakers could get injured if they are hit with heavier objects by those in the gallery in the future.

Another video shared by Brendon Leslie, the CEO of Florida's Voice, showed a chaotic scene as rowdy protesters tossed ""garbage"" and other papers at lawmakers from the House gallery as they voted on amendments to the bill.

""Leftwing activists throw garbage at lawmakers while they’re voting on amendments to bills,"" Leslie said of the footage, which was provided by Florida State University's WFSU-TV and The Florida Channel.

Demonstrators were also filmed chanting ""F--- around, find out"" after they were removed from the House gallery by Capitol security.

The bill making its way through the state legislature has faced strong criticism from Democrats and pro-abortion activists both locally and across the nation.

Florida House Democrats were also photographed joining in on the protests outside the chamber, according to Mitch Perry, a reporter for the Florida Phoenix.

""Florida House Democrats join protest against 6 week abortion bill taking place right outside the House chamber (they've since returned back to the chamber),"" Perry wrote in a tweet. ""Republicans have rejected every amendment Dems have introduced this morning.""

Earlier this month, Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried and state Democratic Sen. Lauren Book were two of 11 people arrested by the Tallahassee Police Department after they refused to leave an area outside the Tallahassee City Hall that had been designated by officers as a spot to protest the measure peacefully.

City officials worked with protest organizers for over a week but determined that the protest could not be accommodated because of the expected size of the crowd and plans of camping overnight. When the group arrived at City Hall, officials allowed them to protest during normal operating hours but told them to leave at sundown or face arrest.

Most of the crowd departed after sunset, but 11 people refused to leave after numerous requests, the city’s press release noted. They were ultimately arrested for trespassing.

Although the state Senate passed the six-week abortion ban, the bill still needs approval from the House before it reaches the desk of Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The state currently allows abortions up to 15 weeks, but if this bill is approved, it moves the state more in line with other Republican-led states.

"Pregnant women in New Jersey ate poppy seeds, then tested positive for opioid drug use","Fans of the hit sitcom ""Seinfeld"" may recall the episode in which Elaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) hilariously tested positive for opium after eating a muffin containing poppy seeds — which got her kicked off a work trip to Kenya.

But for two pregnant women in New Jersey, the real-life repercussions of eating poppy seeds and then testing positive for drugs weren't nearly as funny.

The women ate bagels with poppy seeds last year before heading to two separate hospitals to give birth to their children. Hospital staff administered drug tests to both women — which came back positive for opioids, as a press release from the New Jersey ACLU indicated.

OPIOID DRUGS CAUSE MORE THAN HALF OF YOUNG CHILDREN’S POISONING DEATHS: NEW STUDY

The hospitals reported the women to the New Jersey Department of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) for possible abuse and neglect.

Now, the women are suing the hospitals for discriminatory practices. The New Jersey ACLU's press release shared the filed complaints for each woman.

The women filed lawsuits against the two hospitals, Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack and Virtua Voorhees Hospital in Voorhees Township, for giving them drug tests without their knowledge or consent and ""in the absence of medical necessity.""

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU) filed two complaints on March 8 to the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights on behalf of the women.

The complaints cite a violation of New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination (LAD), which prohibits unlawful employment discrimination based on sex and pregnancy, according to the same press release.

There is also a federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), which ""prohibits discrimination based upon pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,"" and ""requires that women who are pregnant, or affected by related conditions, must be treated in the same manner as other applicants or employees with similar abilities or limitations.""

FENTANYL IS EVEN DEADLIER WHEN MIXED WITH XYLAZINE (OR 'TRANQ'): WHAT YOU MUST KNOW NOW

""No one should be subjected to unnecessary and nonconsensual drug tests,"" said ACLU-NJ staff attorney Molly Linhorst in a press release.

""Our clients are sending a clear message to hospitals that these testing and reporting policies are unacceptable.""

She also said, ""Discriminatory testing policies like these upend what should be a time of joy for families, and so often subject them to further trauma and unwarranted investigation by the state.""

""No one should be subjected to unnecessary and nonconsensual drug tests.""

One of the women, named in the complaint as Kaitlin K., said in a statement that she feels violated.

""This whole ordeal has been extremely stressful and has turned our lives upside down and now, because of what happened, I live in fear of medical tests and how they might be used against me as a mother,"" she said, as the ACLU press release noted.

""I found out later that the lab used a testing threshold far, far lower than what the federal government uses.""

Opiates can be detected in urine drug tests for as long as two days after eating foods containing poppy seeds, according to Winchester Hospital in Masssachusetts.

""Poppy seeds can cause a urine drug test to screen positive for opioids such as morphine, codeine and heroin,"" said Dr. Farah Khorassani, health sciences associate clinical professor at the UCI School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences in Irvine, California, in an email to Fox News Digital.

WHY ANTIBIOTICS MAY NOT HELP PATIENTS SURVIVE THEIR VIRAL INFECTIONS: NEW RESEARCH

Because poppy seeds come from the opium poppy plant, which is also the source of opioid drugs, the seeds are coated with trace amounts of the illicit substances.

""If someone is eating large amounts of poppy seeds and has to get a urine drug screen, they should avoid eating the poppy seeds within 48 hours of the drug screen,"" said Dr. Khorassani.

""Otherwise, most assays [laboratory tests] will not detect the trace amounts of opioids from poppy seeds.""

In addition to bagels and other pastries, some poppy-based teas can cause positive urine drug tests for opioids, the doctor noted.

""Other than that, hemp-containing foods may cause urine drug screens positive for THC, as they have variable concentrations of cannabinoids,"" she said.

Any given drug test’s result will depend on the ""cutoff concentration,"" Gary M. Reisfield, M. D., associate professor of the Division of Addiction Medicine at the University of Florida, told Fox News Digital.

""For example, in most workplace drug testing programs, the cutoff is 2,000 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter), which would screen out most (but not all) results due to poppy seeds,"" he said.

Poppy seeds come from the opium poppy plant, which is also the source of opioid drugs.

However, in medical settings such as hospitals, the cutoff may be as low as 300 ng/mL.

""At this lower cutoff, it’s actually pretty easy to test positive for opiates,"" said Dr. Reisfield. ""A lot depends on how much you eat and the opiate profile of the food — which is not posted on the package.""

A couple of poppy seed bagels, a larger poppy seed muffins or a piece of poppy seed Danish could yield a positive result, he said.

Pregnant women in several other states have filed similar suits challenging hospital drug tests.

In January, a complaint was filed against Saint Alexius Hospital in Chicago after a pregnant woman was drug-tested without consent, as detailed in a press release from the Illinois ACLU. The woman had eaten cake containing poppy seeds before coming to the hospital.

The test was positive for opioids, leading to a three-month investigation by the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).

In 2021, two pregnant women were drug-tested without consent at Garnet Health Medical Center in Middletown, New York, according to a press release from The New York Civil Liberties Union and Pregnancy Justice, a New York-based nonprofit that aims to protect pregnant women's rights.

Both women, who had also eaten foods with poppy seeds, tested positive.

The hospital reported them to the State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (SCR), which led to searches of their homes.

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET.

Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor.

A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers.

At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al.

GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE

While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future.

Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well.

One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor.

Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation.

Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits.

I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor.""

It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time.

Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing.

""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone.

But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands.

Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation.

Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught.

At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future.

Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark.

The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems.

I hope this first ""Turnabout Tale: helps us all to see the possibility in every young life and to recognize the responsibility we as adults have to nurture the light within them.

"'Horrible' bill banning police dogs from being used in arrests would 'embolden' criminals, sheriff says","A California sheriff criticized lawmakers who want to keep police dogs from biting suspected criminals or being used during protests, calling K-9s an important ""less-lethal"" option for law enforcement.

""One of our one of our biggest successes and biggest tools to deescalate situations is the deployment of canines,"" Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told Fox News.

SOROS-BACKED CALIFORNIA DA FLOATED KEEPING GANG MEMBERS ACCUSED OF KILLING TODDLER OUT OF JAIL: REPORT

AB 742 would prohibit police from using dogs to apprehend a suspect or for crowd control. Police dogs would not be allowed to bite people under any circumstances, according to the bill text. The bill does not prevent the use of search and rescue dogs or police K-9s that sniff out bombs or drugs.

""The use of police canines has been a mainstay in this country’s dehumanizing, cruel, and violent abuse of Black Americans and people of color for centuries,"" the bill reads, adding that police dogs were used by slave catchers and, more recently, to quell civil unrest like the Los Angeles race riots and Black Lives Matter protests.

Statistics from the California Department of Justice show no use-of-force injuries involving police dogs during civil disorder or assemblies in 2020 or 2021.

""Every agency should have canines,"" Bianco said, adding that very few deployments of canines result in bites and ""those deployments are all toward violent people.""

There are few national statistics on K-9 use or injuries associated with police dogs, but one study showed police dog bites sent nearly 33,000 people to U. S. hospitals between 2005 and 2013.

In California, police dogs accounted for nearly 14% of the use-of-force incidents that resulted in injury in 2021, according to the state's DOJ. K-9 use is also largely unregulated in California — individual police departments can set their own policies, and training guidelines published almost a decade ago are optional.

But Bianco characterized lawmakers as ""trying to take away a tool that is a non-physical use-of-force"" for police with the ""horrible bill.""

It's ""just going to make criminals more emboldened and more likely to fight with us,"" he said.

Valentine’s Day cards can be mailed or dropped off in person at the address below.

The local radio station recommends card submitters refrain from using glitter and googly eyes, making references to illness or religion and providing candy or toys. Instead, HIS Radio suggests making uplifting and gender-neutral holiday cards that feature standard Valentine’s Day greetings. Cards written in Spanish are also encouraged.

ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST VALENTINE'S DAY CARDS FROM 1818 REDISCOVERED AFTER 20 YEARS

Spreading Valentine’s Day cheer to seniors is an easy task with AARP’s Wish of a Lifetime. The organization has a volunteer-driven Cupid Crew campaign that collects Valentine’s Day cards nationally and delivers these heartfelt notes to seniors who are socially isolated.

Pre-made Cupid Crew Valentine’s Day cards can be downloaded from the Wish of a Lifetime website. Once printed, holiday celebrants can personalize and drop off or mail the cards to local senior communities or someone they know personally.

""Since the pandemic’s start, many older Americans have become more isolated, missing out on chances to connect with their communities and passions in life,"" Wish of a Lifetime's website states. ""Through Cupid Crew, you can help them feel more connected and loved.""

The Love in Action Project has already kicked off its annual Valentine’s Day card drive, which aims to create and deliver 5,000 cards to nursing home residents in North Carolina. The organization matches volunteers with nursing homes, so cards can be sent directly to these facilities.

According to the Love in Action Project, sending Valentine's Day cards to seniors in nursing homes fosters human connection, curbs loneliness and aids physical and mental health.

Volunteers who are interested in participating in this year’s card drive can email the Love in Action Project at info@iamlovenaction.org.

"Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Black history in the U. S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.

Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.

Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE

The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U. S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.

From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.

Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.

Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.

Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.

By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.

Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.

Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850).

Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.

He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.

Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881).

Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.

Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.

She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.

Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more.""

Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS.

By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.

Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.

While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.

Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.

YOUNG BLACK CONSERVATIVES PUSH BACK ON NARRATIVE OF ALL BLACK AMERICANS BEING PROGRESSIVE

Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.

Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.

American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.

Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.

Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900).

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.

American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.

He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.

Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U. S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth.""

Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism.""

Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U. S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.

He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U. S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.

From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.

Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U. S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal.""

Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.

His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U. S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.

Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.

At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.

The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.

The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.

She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.

Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.

In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U. S. House of Representatives reports.

Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics.

Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U. S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.

She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.

Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.

He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.

King delivered his most famous speech, ""I Have a Dream,"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U. S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.

"Vancouver police remove, arrest squatter who set up encampment on one of city's most expensive properties","Police in Canada have removed a squatter who had set up a makeshift shelter on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Vancouver and lived there for almost a year.

A campsite on Vancouver’s Belmont Avenue overlooking Spanish Banks Beach, one of the most pricey and exclusive streets in the city, was completely dismantled by police on Tuesday, and a squatter was arrested, CTV News reported.

The man arrested was identified as Joseph Grenon, and he has been charged with mischief, but police did not offer more specifics beyond that.

""This was an ongoing issue in the community, something our officers took very seriously,"" police said in an email.

Squatting has been a significant issue for residents in the area, specifically on the three large side-by-side lots on Belmont Ave that are valued at roughly $60 million.

Squatters have set up makeshift buildings with wooden planks and blue tarps, changed the locks to the gates multiple times and even brought their own toilets onto the property, the Vancouver Sun reported.

REALTY COMPANY: SQUATTERS MAKING LIFE MISERABLE FOR PROPERTY OWNERS, PHILADELPHIA OFFICIALS DON'T SEEM TO CARE

After being cleared of encampments, the vacant wooded property, which is reportedly owned by an investor who goes by Edison Washington and Qiang Wang, now sits mostly empty, and patrol cars have been spotted driving by to ensure that no one returns.

The Vancouver Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Squatters have been a growing problem in the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic as homeowners have continued to be tormented by individuals camping on vacant properties, showing up with fake paperwork and taking over foreclosed properties.

""I think it's a fairly big problem, and I think it's pretty hard to avoid,"" Jim Burling, vice president of legal affairs for Pacific Legal Foundation, told Fox News Digital last month.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"Calif Rep Katie Porter's ex-husband stands by domestic abuse allegations against her, contradicting campaign","EXCLUSIVE: The ex-husband of California Democrat Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter said he does ""not recant"" his domestic abuse allegations against the congresswoman after her campaign said that he did.

The allegations against Porter include claims that she dumped hot potatoes on her then-husband's head and smashed a glass that led to him being cut by flying shards. Porter has separately faced accusations of running a toxic, emotionally abusive workplace by former staffers.

According to divorce documents received by Fox News Digital, Porter and her ex-husband, Matt Hoffman, both filed domestic violence restraining orders against each other after an April 2013 altercation at the home they shared while legally separated.

Hoffman alleged that Porter hit him ""in the arm, causing a large bruise,"" dumped boiling potatoes on his head and ridiculed him as ""too dumb"" to have a cellphone. He said that the congresswoman ""waited all day, then called the police"" and ""made false allegations"" against him 11 hours after a confrontation while brushing their teeth the day the police were called to their residence.

Police arrested Hoffman on battery charges at the residence after the confrontation in April 2013. Porter requested the temporary restraining order the next day.

Documents obtained by Fox News Digital state that Hoffman regretted making the allegations against Porter in a court-ordered child custody evaluation, but it doesn't specify whether his regret was due to a lack of veracity or another reason.

Porter’s campaign told Fox News Digital that Hoffman had ""retracted"" his statement, but Hoffman said he did ""not recant"" his allegations against the congresswoman.

Hoffman said he did not ""recall stating I regretted making the allegations but, again, it's been a long time.""

""I do not recant the allegations,"" Hoffman added.

Porter’s spokesperson, Lindsay Reilly, told Fox News Digital that on ""the morning of the hearing on Porter’s request for a temporary restraining order following documented violence by her then-husband, her then-husband’s lawyer filed a reciprocal request for protection.""

""This common defensive tactic is designed to intimidate a victim. Her then-husband later admitted, as evidenced by the attached document, that ‘he regretted making these allegations,’"" Reilly said.

""Porter’s then-husband’s allegation was not supported by any evidence, other than his false and later retracted statement,"" she continued.

""Porter's account was supported by police accounts, a doctor's recommendation after a child custody evaluation, her sole request for a move-out order and property control, and ultimately a judge's decision granting her majority physical custody,"" Reilly added.

Porter has repeatedly denied the abuse allegations, which Hoffman made amid a contentious separation and divorce process in 2012 and 2013. But the accusations bubbled back to the surface after multiple former Porter staffers blew the whistle on what they described as Porter's toxic, emotionally abusive management style.

Porter and Hoffman separated in March 2013 and continued to live with each other until their divorce was finalized in December of that year, but the two alleged abuse from each other while living together during their separation.

Divorce filings obtained by Fox News Digital included 2012 allegations from Hoffman that Porter shattered a glass coffee pot after becoming angry over their dirty house, causing him to cut his hands and arms.

Hoffman also alleged that, while married, the congresswoman frequently berated him as a ""f---ing idiot"" and ""f---ing incompetent"" and dumped ""steaming hot potatoes"" on his head during a 2006 confrontation.

""She would not let me have a cellphone because she said, 'You're too f---ing dumb to operate it,'' Hoffman said in comments first resurfaced by the Daily Mail this week.

In her restraining order, Porter alleged Hoffman swore at her and called her names and ""grabbed both [of her] hands and squeezed"" during the April 2013 confrontation that led to his arrest.

The congresswoman also alleged that Hoffman had used his elbow to push her aside after rushing toward her, causing her to stumble and catch herself on a nearby bookshelf.

Porter said she went to find her daughter during the altercation and that Hoffman had yelled at her that she ""was ruining"" their family with the divorce.

""He would not let me leave. It seemed like five minutes or more that I was trapped in the laundry room with him,"" Porter said in the divorce documents.

""He told me that I better not call the police, because if I did, our children would go to foster care,"" Porter said. ""More terrifying, respondent then said, ‘Do you want me to kill myself? Is that what you are trying to make happen here?'""

Hoffman was the primary caretaker of the couple’s three children while Porter was the breadwinner for the family.

On April 30, 2013, Hoffman filed a restraining order with Orange County Superior Court the day before Porter’s temporary order was set to expire.

the mobile air defense protecting Ukraine's skies at a moment's notice,"KYIV, Ukraine - Ihor’s comrades were eager to show us something special. A cone, the remnants of a Russian X-101 missile that didn’t make it to its final destination. The 23-year-old clean-shaven specialist grinned slightly, on his shoulder a soviet era Man-portable air-defense system (MANPAD). Ihor is the 1st Presidential Brigade MANPAD specialist.

After months of training, he was called in December for his first combat mission around Kyiv. When alerts sounded, indicating that a Russian missile or drone was inbound, his squad rushed into position.

When he spotted the missile in flight, Ihor fired the first shot he would ever fire in combat. There was a loud sizzle of a round leaving the MANPAD, followed by cheers from his fellow guardians of the sky.

""At first, I didn't understand anything, then I realized that this is my first rocket hit, and I was very happy."" He told us through an interpreter.

INSIDE THE MASSIVE OPERATION TO TRAIN THOUSANDS OF UKRAINE TROOPS AHEAD OF SPRING COUNTEROFFENSIVE

That X-101 is a personal trophy to him, but it also serves as a reminder to the squad of how important every little shot can be to preventing destruction of infrastructure, to protecting civilian lives. The Brigade has operated since 2014 when bitterness between Russian and Ukrainian loyalists boiled over to a civil conflict in the Donbas region.

Since the beginning of Russia’s full scale invasion, they’ve operated around Kyiv, taking part in the defense of city in the early days of the battles of Irpin, Bucha and Moschun. Under the command of the National Guard of Ukraine, they are on shift at all times, ready to jump into action as soon as the air raid sirens sound. They use a mix of Soviet and Western-provided technology, including Javelins, Stingers and MLAWS.

Mykhailo, is a gunner for the brigade. Originally from Luhansk, he has been a guardsman since 2014 and operates the ZU-23 barreled auto-cannon, a soviet era anti-air gun. The big gun is jury-rigged on the back of a flatbed truck. Mobility is an absolute necessity when they try to intercept the path of inbound warheads that can come from any direction.

""Currently, this weapon is effective for shooting down shaheeds, kamikaze drones. UAV kamikaze Shaheeds."" But there are limits, he told us. The old weapon will not be effective against helicopters or other Russian aircraft that don’t fly close enough to be in range of the old Soviet gun. ""These are outdated weapons, and we need something more modern and more technological""

WAIT IN LINE: RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER LEFT WAITING FOR VISA TO ENTER US AHEAD OF UN MEETING

To call the weapons ""outdated"" may only be scratching the surface. The ZU-23 he operates was made in the 1960s, and the MANPAD that Ihor uses is almost three times his age.

Leaked documents earlier this week from the Pentagon indicated that in late February, the Ukrainian air defense systems were set to begin running out by Mid-May. Ukraine relies heavily on these Soviet-era guns in their arsenal, and without them Russia would have an advantage on Ukrainian frontline positions and civilian targets

""The number of means that arrived from the West is not sufficient, and the number of rockets is certainly not sufficient. That is why we emphasize today that we need the missiles and air defense systems themselves, in order to replace the Soviet-made air defense systems,"" Said Col Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson with the Ukraine Air Command ""After all, [if] these systems are destroyed and fail, we do not have spare parts, because all this equipment is produced in Russia, just like missiles. Therefore, the only way out for us is the transition to NATO standards and weapons samples.""

The U. S. has, since the end of February, seemed to recognize this weakness. The Biden administration last week authorized $2.6 billion in military assistance, which included air-defense munitions and systems such as National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), three air surveillance radars and 30mm and 23mm anti-aircraft ammunition. Ukrainian troops have also completed training on the PATRIOT Missile Battery earlier this year.

But Ukraine has still not received any indication as to whether it will be provided with the prized goal of Western combat aircraft like the F-16, which would be a significant upgrade over their Mig-29 fighters. One Ukrainian combat pilot who spoke with Fox News with the call sign ""Moon Fish"" says the Mig-29s are just a stopgap.

""We are running low on the spare parts, on the armament, on the missiles. And overall, yes, it is a great boost. It is a great possibility to fill the gaps filled with fuel, fill up, from the losses. Together with that, It does not provide us with any sort of new capabilities that we desire.""

Despite old equipment, the 1st Presidential Brigade does not lack a sense of purpose. They know when the attack is launched, the mobile air defense volunteers are all that stands between a deadly inbound warhead and the people of Ukraine. ""It all depends on the gunner,"" says Mikhailo.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Washington state judge addresses abortion pill ruling contradicting Texas judge,"A federal judge in Washington state is clarifying his ruling on access to the abortion pill that contradicts prior rulings by two other federal courts.

In a separate suit brought by 17 states with Democrat attorneys general, Judge Thomas O. Rice issued a ruling that compels the FDA not to do anything that might affect the availability of the abortion drug mifepristone in the suing states.

Rice said his decision, maintaining full unencumbered access to the drug, remains in effect ""irrespective of the Northern District of Texas Court’s ruling or the Fifth Circuit’s anticipated ruling."" That includes access to the drug by mail.

Rice was asked to clarify his position following a federal appeals court ruling late Wednesday that the mifepristone can still be used for now but reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be taken and said it could not be dispensed by mail.

The decision temporarily narrowed a ruling by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the FDA's approval of the drug while a lawsuit over it plays out.

The Biden administration said Thursday it would appeal. The Supreme Court will be the next stop for a legal fight over a drug used in the nation's most common abortion method.

Mifepristone was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration more than two decades ago. It has been used by more than 5 million women to terminate their pregnancies and today more than half of women who end a pregnancy rely on the drug, the DOJ said.

Rice’s order marks a legal victory for abortion rights advocates, but creates further confusion over how the FDA should enforce mifepristone.

Rice’s decision will likely be cited by the Justice Department when it files its appeal with the Supreme Court seeking to reverse key parts of the earlier appeals court ruling.

"GOP states rip AOC, Dems for pushing Biden to ignore abortion pill ruling","EXCLUSIVE — A group of Republican attorneys general is demanding that Democrats retract their suggestion that the Biden administration should defy a court order aimed at stopping the distribution of the abortion pill mifepristone.

Last week, a federal judge in Texas signed an injunction that directed the FDA to halt its more than 20-year-old approval of mifepristone while a lawsuit challenging its safety and approval works its way through court.

Democrats were incensed by the ruling, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y., who said that the Biden administration should ""ignore"" it. She said ""deeply partisan"" judges have ""engaged in unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts.""

""The interesting thing when it comes to a ruling is that it relies on enforcement,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN. ""And it is up to the Biden administration to enforce, to choose whether or not to enforce a ruling.""

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., issued a similar statement that called on President Biden and the FDA to ignore the ruling that he said has no ""basis in law"" but is ""rooted in conservatives' dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said on CNN last week, ""What you saw — by that one judge, in that one court, in that one state — that’s not America.""

Nine Republican AGs say those statements are so egregious, the Democrats need to retract them ""or resign.""

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, along with eight other Republican AGs who filed briefs in support of the ruling, sent a letter to those outspoken Democrats that scolded them for their statements, which they said are ""akin to a call to overthrow the Constitution.""

""This is the most anti-rule of law administration we’ve had in recent history. The fact that Becerra is even considering this means he should resign immediately,"" Bailey told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""Expressing mere disagreement with a court order, as all attorneys have done, is nothing like your call for the FDA not to comply with a court order. The difference between the two is enormous. For a party to defy a court order simply because one does not like it is an attack on our very system of government and the rule of law,"" the AGs stated in the letter exclusively reviewed by Fox News Digital.

HHS SECRETARY SAYS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IGNORING FEDERAL JUDGE’S ABORTION PILL RULING IS ‘ON THE TABLE’

""You ought to know better,"" the AGs wrote. ""Like each of us, you have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. Your anti-Constitution rhetoric is more than just wrong. It also erodes the culture of the rule of law that has taken centuries to build.

""Other nations have fallen into tyranny quickly when those who should have been upholding the rule of law chose instead to lead mobs against it. Your rash, inflammatory, anti-Constitution statements are unacceptable.

""You must retract or resign.""

On Wednesday, the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to keep mifepristone available only to be dispensed up to seven weeks, not 10, and not by mail, a decision that partially overturned the Texas ruling.

On Thursday, the Justice Department weighed in by asking the Supreme Court to issue a stay on the entire injunction issued by the Texas judge.

""The Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA to deny, in part, our request for a stay pending appeal,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.

Missouri Republican lawmaker clarifies comments about 12-year-olds getting married,"A Missouri Republican state lawmaker on Tuesday said children as young as 12 years old should be able to get married as he defended a proposed bill banning gender-affirming care for minors.

Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, sat before a panel on Tuesday to defend and debate a bill that would ban all gender transition procedures for anyone under the age of 18.

The bill passed the Missouri Senate in March and is now before the House.

During the questioning, Rep. Peter Meredith, a Democrat, called Moon out for his stance on marriage of 12-year-olds if parental consent were given.

""You voted ‘no’ on making it illegal for kids to be married to adults at the age of 12 if their parents consented to it,"" Meredith said to Moon. ""You said, actually, that should be the law because it’s the parents’ right and the kid’s right to decide what’s best for them. To be raped by an adult.""

Moon did not deny supporting the measure. In fact, he defended it, to a degree.

""Do you know any kids who have been married at age 12?"" he asked Meredith.

""I don’t need to,"" Meredith said.

""I do,"" Moon said. ""And guess what? They’re still married.""

Video of the senator making the statements made the rounds on social media, catching the eye of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who tweeted about them on Wednesday.

""Meanwhile, in Missouri: State Senator Mike Moon is advocating for 12-year-old kids to be married off to adults,"" Newsom tweeted.

Moon retweeted Newsom’s post with a statement of his own.

""To be clear, I did not advocate for minors to be married off to adults,"" he tweeted, directing followers to a video he made to help clear the air. ""Keep your California politics out of Missouri. Democrats will say whatever they can to make sure they can keep mutilating children.""

A spokesman for Moon spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday, who said the one-hour committee meeting had strict time constraints and the senator did not have time to clear up his comments before Meredith moved on to the next.

Had he been given the time, the spokesman explained, Moon would have clarified he did not support 12-year-old children getting married to adults.

Moon does support, though, 12-year-olds getting married to people closer in age, like another 12-year-old.

During the debate, Moon said he knew kids who were 12 years old when they got married. According to the spokesman, one of the 12-year-olds got pregnant, and the parents encouraged them to get married.

The two children got married but were raised in two different states. Once they became adults, the spokesman said, they got back together, and they have been happily married ever since.

When asked how old the married couple is today, the spokesman said they are in their 50s.

Moon also addressed the issue on YouTube on Thursday.

Stefanik to join Jordan for field hearing on New York City’s ‘crime crisis’,"House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is expected to join the House Judiciary Committee in next week's hearing focused on the crime crisis in New York City, Fox News Digital has learned.

The House Judiciary Committee is holding a field hearing in New York City to ""examine how Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.""

The hearing, ""Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan,"" is scheduled for 9 a.m. Monday at the Javits Federal Building.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked for Stefanik to join the panel for Monday's hearing.

BODEGA CLERK JOSE ALBA TO TESTIFY AT HOUSE JUDICIARY FIELD HEARING ON VIOLENT CRIME UNDER NYC DA ALVIN BRAGG

Stefanik, who represents New York’s 21st Congressional District, is not a member of the House Judiciary Committee, but Republicans are expected to let her participate in the panel’s highly anticipated hearing in lower Manhattan.

""New York City is the epicenter of the crime crisis,"" Stefanik told Fox News Digital. She blamed ""far-left radical district attorneys like Alvin Bragg"" for ""causing this crime crisis.""

MANHATTAN DA SAYS HOUSE GOP SEEKING TO 'WEAKEN' LAW ENFORCEMENT: 'ABUSE OF POWER'

Stefanik felt strongly about participating in the hearing, saying ""victims need a voice"" and stressing that victims of violent crime come from ""all political backgrounds.""

""New Yorkers fear for their safety,"" Stefanik said, pointing to the ""revolving door of criminals released back into the communities"" who are ""wreaking havoc"" on the city.

""I intend to make sure New Yorkers are represented at this hearing,"" she said.

Jose Alba, a bodega clerk charged with murder after acting in self-defense, will be one of the witnesses at the hearing.

Bragg took over as district attorney in January 2022 from Cyrus Vance. The crime wave has intensified under Bragg's watch.

""He is refusing to go after criminals but is prosecuting Joe Biden’s top opponent,"" Stefanik said of his investigation into former President Trump.

Trump last week pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in New York. The charges, which are related to hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign, came out of Bragg’s investigation.

Bragg alleged Trump ""repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.""

Trump has slammed the DA’s investigation and the indictment as ""political persecution and election interference at the highest level in history.""

JORDAN TAKES FIGHT TO ALVIN BRAGG, PLANS NYC HEARING ON HIS ‘PRO-CRIME’ POLICIES

""New Yorkers are smart,"" Stefanik said. ""They want their DA to prosecute violent criminals.""

As for Democrats, Stefanik said, ""They continue to put their heads in the sand.

""Their policies have caused the crime crisis in New York. Republicans stand strongly with police, with law enforcement and with victims.""

Trump was back in New York City Thursday for a deposition before New York State Attorney General Letitia James. James, a Democrat, has been conducting a civil investigation into the Trump Organization since she took office in January 2019.

James brought a lawsuit against Trump in September alleging he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets. She also alleged Trump ""inflated his net worth by billions of dollars"" and said his children helped him to do so.

When asked for comment, Stefanik told Fox News Digital that James is ""part of the far-left radicals.""

Parkinson's researchers discover disease biomarker in key breakthrough,"An international group of researchers has discovered a new tool that can reveal a key pathology of Parkinson's disease in brain and body cells.

The identification of the new biomarker, known as abnormal alpha-synuclein, opens a new chapter for research, according to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.

The foundation led the coalition and its landmark clinical study, Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

The findings were published Wednesday in the scientific journal The Lancet Neurology.

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN, 54, REVEALS PARKINSON'S DIAGNOSIS, SAYS 'DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME'

The tool, also known as the α-synuclein seeding amplification assay, is able to detect pathology in spinal fluid both for those diagnosed with the disease and individuals who are at high risk of developing it but have not yet been diagnosed or exhibited clinical symptoms.

The laboratory testing can confirm the presence of abnormal alpha-synuclein, which is detected in most people who have Parkinson's with what the foundation said was ""astonishing accuracy.""

Of those who participated in the testing, 93% were proven to have abnormal alpha-synuclein.

""We've never previously been able to see in a living person whether they have this alpha-synuclein biological change happening in their body,"" Dr. Todd Sherer, chief mission officer at The Michael J. Fox Foundation, said in a statement.

A protein normally found in the nervous system, alpha-synuclein — like amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease — can start to misfold and clump, damaging neurons and causing Parkinson’s disease to develop.

It has previously been possible to confirm the presence of the clumps solely through postmortem analysis. If abnormal alpha-synuclein is present in a spinal fluid sample, clumps form and the dye the sample is prepared with lights up.

The foundation notes the new tool ""takes advantage of a telling characteristic of alpha-synuclein that is pathologic,"" causing nearby, normal alpha-synuclein to misfold and clump.

The scientists tested some 1,123 samples of spinal fluid, showing the test was abnormal in fewer than 5% of people without Parkinson's.

The foundation said there is ""tremendous promise in optimizing"" the assay to measure the amount of alpha-synuclein present.

""I’m moved, humbled and blown away by this breakthrough, which is already transforming research and care, with enormous opportunity to grow from here,"" foundation co-founder Michael J. Fox said. ""I’m so grateful for the support of patients, families and researchers who are in it with us as we continue to kick down doors on the path to eradicating Parkinson’s once and for all.""

Optimized assays would also detect abnormal synuclein through a blood draw or nasal swab.

France's Macron defends controversial comments on being US ally amid Chinese aggression toward Taiwan,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday defended controversial comments he made during his trip to China last week regarding Europe’s relationship with the U. S. as it relates to escalating tensions with Beijing over Taiwan.

In a press conference from the Netherlands, Macron told reporters that ""being an ally does not mean being a vassal,"" adding that it ""doesn't mean that we don't have the right to think for ourselves.""

""France is for the status quo in Taiwan"" and a ""peaceful resolution to the situation,"" he said, according to DW, following pushback he has received over his comments suggesting that Europeans must not be ""followers"" of the U. S.

FRANCE'S MACRON MET WITH ANGRY PROTESTS DURING SPEECH IN NETHERLANDS, DAY AFTER SPARKING OUTRAGE ON TAIWAN

On Monday Macron raised international eyebrows after he was quoted from a Friday interview as having said, ""The question we need to answer, as Europeans, is the following: Is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No.""

""The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the U. S. agenda and a Chinese overreaction,"" he added.

The Biden administration has remained quiet in response to the French president’s comments during his trip to China – a nation listed as the U. S.’s top adversary and chief threat across the spectrum.

But Republicans on and off the Hill have outwardly condemned the comments, including GOP 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump, who said, ""Macron, who's a friend of mine, is over with China, kissing his a--,"" in reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Macron responded to the former president’s comments and condemned them as escalatory.

""France does not support provocations, does not engage in fantasy politics and considers the status quo, respect and clarity are the best allies of European strategic autonomy,"" Macron said, according to DW.

FRENCH ECONOMIC MINISTER ASSURES US ITS OLDEST ALLY ISN'T SNUBBING THEM WITH CHINA OVERTURE

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz also took to Twitter and blamed President Biden for the controversial comments in a tweet Wednesday, calling them ""stunning.""

"Bahrain, Qatar restore relations after 6 year blockade","The Gulf nations of Bahrain and Qatar agreed to restore diplomatic relations late Wednesday.

Bahrain had been the last holdout of four Arab nations that imposed a boycott and blockade on Qatar in 2017. They were angered by Qatar's support for Islamist groups that rose to power in some countries following the 2011 Arab Spring protests, which the other autocratic nations viewed as terrorist organizations.

The blockade was lifted at the start of 2021, and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have restored ties with Qatar since then, with top leaders paying official visits in recent months.

Bahrain and Qatar each issued official statements announcing the decision to restore relations following a meeting between their delegations at the headquarters of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-nation bloc of which both are members, in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

The four nations had severed all ties to Qatar, and at the height of the crisis there was even talk in local media of digging a trench along the 54-mile border between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and filling it with nuclear waste.

The boycott had little impact on Qatar's economy, however. The tiny Gulf country, which hosted soccer's World Cup last year, is one of the wealthiest countries on Earth owing to its vast natural gas reserves. Turkey, which is also friendly to Islamist groups, stepped in to aid Qatar during the crisis.

Greek Orthodox Church accuses Israeli police of violating 'Holy Fire' worshippers' rights,"The Greek Orthodox Church on Wednesday accused Israeli police of infringing on the freedom of worshippers with ""heavy-handed"" restrictions on how many pilgrims can attend the ""Holy Fire"" ceremony amid soaring tensions.

Israeli police said the limits are needed for safety during Saturday's celebration at the ancient Church of the Holy Sepulcher, a holy site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected.

Saturday’s ""Holy Fire"" celebration comes during a recent spate of violence in the Old City, touched off by an Israeli police raid on Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site, the compound that’s home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The tensions spiraled into a regional confrontation between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, and were punctuated Friday when two British-Israeli sisters and their mother were killed after their car came under fire near a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. The mother succumbed to her wounds on Monday.

Israel, which imposed similar restrictions on the ""Holy Fire"" event last year, says it wants to prevent another disaster after a crowd stampede in 2021 at a packed Jewish holy site left 45 people dead. Christian leaders say there’s no need to alter a ceremony that has been held for centuries.

Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that on the Saturday before Easter, a miraculous flame appears inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. The Greek patriarch enters the Holy Edicule, a chamber built on the traditional site of Jesus' tomb, and emerges with two lit candles. He passes the flame among thousands of people holding candles, gradually illuminating the walls of the darkened basilica. The flame will be transferred to Orthodox communities in other countries on special flights. The source of the Holy Fire has been a closely guarded secret for centuries, with an abundance of skeptics.

Church officials told reporters in Jerusalem on Wednesday that negotiations with the police over their ""heavy-handed"" restrictions had failed.

""After many attempts made in good will, we are not able to coordinate with the Israeli authorities as they are enforcing unreasonable restrictions on access to the Holy Sepulcher,"" the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem said, calling the limitations ""heavy-handed.""

""We will hold the ceremony as customary for two millennia and invite all who wish to worship with us to attend,"" said Father Mattheos Siopis of the Greek Orthodox Church. ""We leave the authorities to act as they will. The churches will freely worship and do so in peace.""

COLUMBIA'S PLAN TO OPEN ISRAEL CENTER SPARKS FACULTY OUTCRY OVER 'RIGHT WING' GOVERNMENT: REPORT

Israeli police officials acknowledged that they are increasing security and blocking some routes into the dense Old City and that attendance is limited in the ancient church and courtyard. But in a conference call with reporters, officials said the attendance limits — 1,800 people inside the church which Greek Orthodox officials said was a fraction of previous years — were set by the church.

Chief Superintendent Yoram Segal of the Jerusalem District Police told reporters during a conference call that the police's top priority is safety on a day when Muslims, Christians and Jews are celebrating their own holidays in the square-half mile Old City.

""We are going to regulate the movement of crowds,"" Segal said, adding that the holy fire ceremony will be available throughout the city on video screens and that meetings with the churches are ongoing.

Rays on verge of breaking 138-year-old MLB record after sweeping Red Sox,"The Tampa Bay Rays still don’t know what losing feels like in the 2023 MLB season after sweeping the Boston Red Sox Thursday afternoon to win their 13th straight.

This win ties the MLB record for the longest streak without a loss to start a season, a record that has stood for 138 years.

Since 1885, only the 1982 Atlanta Braves and 1987 Milwaukee Brewers have gone 13-0 to start a season. But these Rays seem set on getting into a league of their own.

The Rays had another offensive onslaught against the Red Sox with a seven-run fifth inning deciding the game before it was even over. Brandon Lowe went yard for the fifth time in his last six games, and Yandy Diaz hit his fourth of the season in the first inning off Corey Kluber.

Harold Ramirez led the way with three RBIs after a bases-clearing double capped the fifth-inning surge.

With the 9-3 win over the Sox, the Rays now look to make history.

ESPN PUNDIT DOESN'T TAKE RAYS SERIOUSLY DESPITE HOT START: ‘PUT A LOT OF COLD WATER ON THIS WINNING STREAK’

The Toronto Blue Jays, another AL East rival, await the Rays for a game Friday night at Rogers Centre. It’s a road game for Tampa after the Rays played six at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. And it will be their toughest opponent this season.

The Blue Jays are 8-4 entering Thursday night's game against the Detroit Tigers to finish a series, one the Jays are hoping to sweep at home.

But the Rays are getting a matchup Friday night that may favor them.

Jose Berrios is slated to start for Toronto, and he hasn’t gotten off to a very good start after posting a 5.23 ERA over 32 starts in 2022. Berrios has allowed 14 earned runs over 9.2 innings in two starts this season. With a .287 team batting average, the Rays may feast.

However, the Blue Jays are the only team better than the Rays in that category this season, hitting .289 as a team. But the Rays have been ruthless with runs scored over this stretch, bringing home 101 runners.

The Blue Jays, by comparison, have scored 67 runs.

The Rays have also enjoyed the long ball this season, belting 32 homers in 13 games. They've struck out 94 times, tied for fifth fewest with the New York Mets among the 30 MLB teams.

RAYS ACCOMPLISH FEAT NOT SEEN SINCE 1987 AS THEY CONTINUE TO SHINE TO START 2023

For the Rays, Drew Rasmussen will take the mound in Toronto. Rasmussen has not allowed a run this season, and he’s only given up three hits over 13 innings. Rasmussen has been solid since he was acquired by the Rays in 2021, posting a 2.84 ERA in 28 starts last season.

"US CENTCOM captures ISIS operative, associates in helicopter raid in Syria","U. S. Central Command forces over the weekend captured an ISIS operative and his associates in a helicopter raid that the command believes will help further destabilize the terrorist group.

CENTCOM said the helicopter raid was carried out in Syria late Saturday evening. The forces captured Hudayfah al Yemeni – an ""ISIS attack facilitator"" – and two of his associates.

No civilians were killed or injured in the raid, CENTCOM said.

""Operations against ISIS are important for the security and stability of the region,"" CENTCOM spokesman Col. Joe Buccino. ""ISIS remains a threat to the region and beyond – the group retains the capability to conduct operations in Iraq and Syria with a desire to strike beyond the Middle East, and its vile ideology remains a threat.""

Buccino added that such operations reaffirm the U. S.’ commitment to the ""enduring defeat of ISIS.""

California reparations panel says total cost 'least important' aspect despite potential $800B price tag,"A member of California's reparations task force is dismissing the total dollar amount as the ""least important piece"" of their proposal, despite the committee considering doling out nearly triple the state's existing budget in payments to Black residents as a way to make amends for slavery and subsequent discrimination.

""We want to make sure that this is presented out in a way that does not reinforce the preoccupation with a dollar figure, which is the least important piece of this,"" Cheryl Grills, a clinical psychologist and member of the California Reparations Task Force, told CalMatters in a new interview.

""It's important,"" continued Grills, ""but it's the least important in terms of being able to get to a point in our country's history and in California's history where we recognize that the harm cuts across multiple areas and domains and that the repair needs to align with that.""

Last month, economists predicted in a preliminary estimate that California's reparations plan could cost the state over $800 billion. The task force, which consulted five economists and policy experts to arrive at the number, clarified that the total does not include compensations for property the group says was taken unjustly, or for the devaluation of Black-owned businesses. California's total annual budget currently sits at roughly $300 billion.

The task force had previously been considering a proposal to give just under $360,000 per person to approximately 1.8 million Black Californians who had an ancestor enslaved in the U. S., putting the total cost of the program at about $640 billion.

It's unclear how California would pay for large-scale reparations. Newsom announced in January that the state faces a projected budget deficit of $22.5 billion for the coming fiscal year. Then weeks later, the California Legislative Analyst's Office, a government agency that analyzes the budget for the state legislature, estimated in a subsequent report that Newsom's forecast undershot the mark by about $7 billion.

Still, Grills chided the media for covering California's reparations proposals by focusing on the dollar amount.

""It's really unfortunate. I'm actually sad to see that our news media is not able to nuance better,"" she said. ""It's almost like, 'What's going to be sensational' as opposed to what's important.""

A final report with the panel's official recommendations is due by July 1 to the California Legislature, which will then decide whether to implement the measures and send them to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.

Newsom, a Democrat, signed a bill creating the task force amid the unrest following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He appointed the majority of the panel's nine members, one of whom are White.

Another task force member, Lisa Holder, president of the far-left Equal Justice Society, vowed in a recent opinion piece that the committee's ""recommendations will be breathtaking.""

According to California Justice Department officials, the law creating the task force did not instruct the committee to identify funding sources.

NEWSOM FALLS SILENT AFTER CALLS FOR HIM TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION ON REPARATIONS

""The task force is required by AB 3121 to recommend to the legislature methods for calculating reparations and the scope of reparations,"" Senior Assistant Attorney General Michael Newman previously told CalMatters. ""Based on their recommendations, the legislature is ultimately tasked with implementing these changes into law and figuring out how to pay for it.""

More recently, the panel's chair, Kamilah Moore, said last month it's up to the state legislature to determine a restitution amount based on the methodology economists recommended.

""The task force is pretty much done regarding the compensation component,"" she told KCRA. ""Our task was to create a methodology for calculation for various forms of compensation that correspond with our findings.""

MEET SOME OF THE CONTROVERSIAL INDIVIDUALS BEHIND SAN FRANCISCO'S $5M REPARATIONS PUSH: 'AMERICA, YOU OWE US'

The $5 million figure appeared to come from the city of San Francisco, which is currently weighing its own reparations proposals at the local level to pay that amount to qualifying Black residents.

Beyond the money, proponents of reparations are also seeking a range of other measures, including an apology letter from the state of California for past discrimination.

Gavin Newsom's office fails to provide proof of Florida college book ban claimed by California governor,"California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom took aim at a Florida college that he called ""ground zero"" for what Republicans want to do to education nationwide.

The progressive champion singled out the Sarasota-based New College of Florida, whose board of trustees was revamped by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a Wednesday message to his 2 million Twitter followers. Newsom said the institution is banning books, among other allegations of limiting speech.

""Last week, I went to New College in Florida – ground zero for what the [Republicans] are trying to do to education in this country,"" Newsom said on Wednesday.

""Take a moment to watch this. Books are banned. Speech is limited. Faculty are scared. Students are bullied. This is just a small dose of what's to come.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office asking them to provide a list of the alleged banned books at the institution. However, they failed to do so and did not respond to the inquiry.

Newsom's attacks further add to the speculation he may be exploring a future presidential run. DeSantis, also a likely presidential contender, appointed six members to New College of Florida's board of trustees in January. The college has since taken a rightward turn in pushing back against educational policies, including abolishing its diversity office.

Meanwhile, one of the college's DeSantis-appointed trustees, Christopher Rufo, responded to Newsom's message by saying he's spreading falsehoods.

""Gavin Newsom is spreading lies and falsely claiming that 'books are banned' at New College of Florida,"" Rufo said. ""He wants to put all Americans under the boot of DEI commissars and California's failed policies.""

Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, later said that Newsom visited the college to ""spread lies about Ron DeSantis' higher-education reforms"" and that ""no amount of hair gel"" could stop them from ""restoring classical liberal arts education in Florida.""

During Newsom's visit, he met with students and faculty who were reportedly upset with the school's current trajectory, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

""I'm crawling out of my skin for you guys,"" Newsom said during his visit. ""I want you to know you're not alone. You matter, we care. This is the 'why I'm here.' I'm not your governor. But I'm a member of the larger community all bound together.""

"Texas hospital sees 30 infant deaths in 15-month period, warns parents of co-sleeping dangers","A single hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, reported that it has seen 30 infant deaths due to unsafe sleeping conditions since January 2022, according to a press release issued last week from Cook Children’s Medical Center.

The hospital is sharing the statistics in an effort to raise awareness of the dangers to babies posed by co-sleeping, as well as the dangers posed by blankets, pillows and other fabrics.

The babies were not born at Cook Children’s — but were transported there after the incidents or deaths.

OHIO WOMAN'S SECOND BABY KILLED 'AS A RESULT OF CO-SLEEPING': WHAT IS CO-SLEEPING?

The majority of the reported infant deaths occurred when a parent or caregiver slept in the same bed with the baby.

Other causes included ""infants asleep on a pillow with a bottle, in the crib with a blanket or pillow, in a recliner or couch next to a sleeping adult or wearing a loose-fitting T-shirt that covered her face,"" the press release stated.

The age group that experienced the highest number of deaths from unsafe sleeping conditions was 2 to 6 months old.

Sharon Evans, the traumatic injury prevention coordinator at Cook Children’s, said the 30 infant deaths over the past 15 months is the highest number she has seen since she joined the staff 15 years ago.

""We don't have to wait for it to happen in our home to be aware of the danger. We want them to understand that this is a very preventable situation,"" said Candle Johnson, a registered pediatric nurse at Cook Children's Renaissance Neighborhood Clinic in South Fort Worth, in the hospital’s press release.

""Let's be proactive today so we don't have to be reactive tomorrow. If a fatality occurs, how do we move forward when we could have prevented it in the first place?""

""Let's be proactive today so we don't have to be reactive tomorrow.""

Johnson has made it her mission to educate families on the dangers of co-sleeping — which is when the baby shares a bed with a parent or caregiver — and the importance of having the baby sleep alone in a crib, bassinet or other flat, contained surface.

PEDIATRIC EXPERTS GIVE NEW RECOMMENDATIONS TO KEEP SLEEPING BABIES SAFE

She said many women succumb to the temptation to have the baby sleep next to them or with them while breastfeeding.

""I advise against this practice because, although it may be easier, it is not safe,"" Johnson said in the press release.

""No one can control your bodily functions when you are sleeping. When you are in a deep sleep and your baby is next to you, you cannot say, ‘I am not going to roll over on him.’""

Other potential dangers include the baby suffocating under covers or pillows or getting trapped under the adult’s body or between the headboard and mattress, Johnson said in the release.

Fox News Digital reached out to Cook Children’s Medical Center for additional comment.

Approximately 3,400 babies every year die from unsafe sleeping conditions in the U. S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Some parents may face challenges that could put their babies at a higher risk of death from unsafe sleeping conditions, Johnson shared.

Those include lack of knowledge about optimal sleeping environments, financial hardship that makes it difficult to purchase a crib or bassinet, or a mistrust of medical advice, the press release stated.

Evans pointed out that in many cases, parents unknowingly may put their babies in danger.

""Parents want to do their best, but are often exhausted from feeding their babies at night and from other aspects of caring for a baby,"" she said in the Cook Children’s press release.

""Nobody does it intentionally. I don't think any of the parents who sleep with the baby think there could be any danger.""

Cook Children’s is just one of many hospitals that have seen the tragic loss of infant life due to unsafe sleeping arrangements.

Dr. Jenelle Ferry, a neonatologist and director of feeding, nutrition and infant development at Pediatrix Medical Group in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has experienced many cases of babies dying from unsafe sleeping situations, such as co-sleeping with a caregiver and being put to sleep with soft blankets — leading to suffocation.

""Sometimes a baby is able to be revived, but then suffers permanent severe brain injury from lack of oxygen, which may take away"" the baby's ability ""to ever learn to walk or talk,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Ferry said she's also experienced a case of co-sleeping in the hospital after a baby was born, which resulted in the infant falling out of the bed — and suffering a fractured skull and bleeding in the brain.

""These cases are heartbreaking because they can be prevented.""

""These cases are devastating because they involve babies so full of life and potential, but also because they involve loving and well-meaning parents who are usually exhausted and may not fully comprehend how something so seemingly simple could have such life-altering consequences,"" she said.

""These cases are heartbreaking because they can be prevented,"" Ferry continued.

Caregiver education is a critical part of preventing accidental infant death, said Ferry. This applies not just to parents, but also to babysitters and any other family members who will be caring for the infant.

""The hospitals I’ve worked in all have some degree of education on safe sleep,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""This should also be part of regular pediatrician visits.""

Ferry said parents should be educated about the importance of placing babies on their backs to sleep, keeping them in their own crib or bassinet on a firm, flat surface, and removing blankets and pillows from the sleep environment.

RECORD-BREAKING TWINS BORN FOUR MONTHS EARLY DEFY ODDS: ‘GOD WAS IN CONTROL’

Any other sleeping surfaces, such as portable cribs or other devices, should meet the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

In 1994, the National Institute of Child Health and Infant Development and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) launched the ""Back to Sleep"" campaign to spread awareness and prevention measures for sudden infant death.

It was later renamed ""Safe to Sleep"" to include a wider range of recommendations for reducing infant suffocation and promoting safe sleep.

Cook Children’s has launched its own Safe Sleep for Babies Council, which provides portable cribs and sleeping bags to families that need them.

Many parents make the mistake of thinking about an infant’s comfort in the same way they do their own, Ferry pointed out.

""While I may sleep more comfortably with a soft mattress topper and lots of blankets, I also have good head and neck control, can roll over and can remove a blanket from my face if it starts to interfere with my breathing,"" she explained.

With a baby, a similar environment will increase the risk of suffocation because he or she hasn’t yet developed. Only a tightly fitted sheet should be placed in a baby’s crib.

Instead of co-sleeping, the AAP recommends room sharing, which is when the baby’s crib or bassinet is kept in the room with the parent or caregiver.

Ferry said there are some safe tools available to help encourage good infant sleep, like swaddling blankets and sound machines that produce white noise to simulate the comforting sound of the womb.

MICHIGAN COUPLE WELCOMES 1ST BABY GIRL BORN INTO THE FAMILY AFTER 138 YEARS OF BOYS: 'UTTER SHOCK'

""A pacifier can be part of a safe sleep environment and has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of sudden infant death,"" she said.

The same safety precautions should apply outside the crib, too — when infants sleep with someone on a couch, cushion or soft chair, the risk of sleep-related death is up to 67 times higher, according to the AAP.

""Don’t leave infants sleeping on soft surfaces like couches or pillows unless they are directly supervised,"" Ferry said.

Instead of co-sleeping, the AAP recommends room sharing, which is when the baby’s crib, bassinet or play yard is kept in the room with the parent or caregiver.

This will make it easier to monitor, comfort and care for the baby while decreasing the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) by up to 50%.

The ""Safe to Sleep"" campaign focuses on the first year of life, as the highest risk for infant sleep-related deaths is in the first two to six months.

""As infants learn to roll over on their own, their risk of suffocation starts to decrease,"" Ferry told Fox News Digital.

""They should still be placed to sleep on their back — not their stomach and not their side — until one year of age, but if a baby rolls over on their own, the parents don’t need to worry about rolling him back over.""

Shaq suggests Jill Biden's Iowa White House invitation wish was race related,"LSU alum and NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal voiced his doubts about first lady Jill Biden's motivations for inviting the Iowa women's basketball team to the White House.

Biden drew ire this month when she suggested that the Hawkeyes should also be invited to the White House along with the national champion LSU Tigers as part of the tradition of sports champions being recognized by the president for their achievements.

LSU defeated Iowa handily in the national title game thanks to a dominant performance from Angel Reese, who was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player. Caitlin Clark, who set the basketball world on fire during the tourney, put up a valiant effort, but Iowa was outmatched at the end.

Biden, who was at the game, said on the Monday after the game that she would suggest to her husband, President Joe Biden, that Iowa come to the White House, too.

Reese responded with laughing emojis and called her suggestion ""A JOKE."" She even speculated that LSU wouldn’t visit the White House at all after the comment.

As the basketball world dissected the remarks, O’Neal suggested Biden’s invitation was related to race – Reese is Black and Clark is White.

He and ""The Big Podcast"" co-host Nischelle Turner talked about the issue.

""Although we know she doesn’t make the decision, that caused a big uproar. What did you think about that? Because, you know, we are in this era of participation trophies,"" Turner said.

O’Neal replied, ""No, but that’s not what it was about. That’s not what it was about. I want people to use their imaginations. You know what it was about. I’m not going to mention it. You know what it was about, right?""

Turner said ""we can say it"" and added the matter became a ""race issue.""

""It became a team of all Black girls beating a team of all White girls. That’s what it became,"" she said.

""So, in the history of me going to the White House and all the champions going to the White House, we never even mentioned the second team, right?"" he said. ""But the fact that it was that versus that, and the other [team] that lost, that’s when they wanted to make it a participation: ‘Oh, they lost, but they were there and all that.'""

O’Neal and co-host Spice Adams agreed that if Iowa had won then LSU wouldn’t have even been a thought on Biden’s mind.

""Everybody counted their chickens before they hatched,"" O’Neal said. ""Let me just explain why. Iowa’s championship game wasn’t that game; Iowa’s championship game was when they beat South Carolina.""

""The almighty Black girl team is undefeated, who was going to beat them, and they beat them. So, when they beat them, they got happy, and then when LSU came along, they thought they was going to, you know, run us over. But we had way too many dogs.""

O’Neal also declared Reese the best athlete to come out of LSU sports.

Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, tweeted that the first lady meant no disrespect to the Tigers.

""Her comments in Colorado were intended to applaud the historic game and all women athletes,"" she wrote. ""She looks forward to celebrating the LSU Tigers on their championship win at the White House.""

Despite all the controversy, Reese said she would join her team on a White House visit.

""In the beginning we were hurt – it was emotional because we know how hard we worked all year for everything,"" Reese said Friday, per ESPN. ""You don't get that experience [to go to the White House] ever ... and I know my team probably wants to go for sure and my coaches are supportive of that, so I'm going to do what's best for the team, and we've decided we're going to go.""

"Tunisian officials report 25 Europe-bound migrants dead, 15 missing in Mediterranean","At least 25 African migrants died and 15 are missing after a boat carrying them toward Europe sank in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Tunisia this week, Tunisian authorities said.

The Tunisian coast guard on Thursday recovered the bodies of 15 people trapped under the boat near the coast of Sfax, a port in east-central Tunisia, Sfax Prosecutor Faouzi Masmoudi told the Associated Press.

On Wednesday, the coast guard recovered 10 other bodies and rescued 72 migrants from the sunken vessel he said. The prosecutor estimated that 15 to 20 others who had been on the boat are still missing, based on survivors' accounts.

TUNISIA SAYS MORE THAN 2 DOZEN MIGRANTS DIED OFF COAST WHILE HEADING TO ITALY

Nearly all those who died or were rescued were from sub-Saharan Africa, Masmoudi said.

Attempts at illegal migration have increased in recent weeks from the Tunisian coast towards the nearby Italian coast, leaving dozens dead and many missing. The central Mediterranean is the most dangerous migration route in the world, according to the International Organization for Migration.

European countries rely on countries in North Africa to police migration, and Italy on Thursday pledged Tunisia a host of investments and help negotiating an International Monetary Fund bailout as the Italian government seeks to stem the number of migrant arrivals.

Cyprus probing residents involved in alleged Russian sanctions evasion,"Cyprus' government said Thursday it's looking into how a number of Cypriot nationals were included in a new round of U. S. and U.K. sanctions targeting the financial networks of Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Roman Abramovich who are close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides called an emergency meeting of top officials to investigate the involvement of three Cypriot nationals, three executives holding dual Cypriot-Russian citizenship, a Russian Cypriot-Israeli national and another resident of Cyprus who were among executives running Cypriot-registered trusts and other businesses involved in alleged sanctions-busting for Usmanov.

In a statement, government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said a number of decisions were taken ""for the exclusive purpose of protecting Cyprus’ name as a reliable, financial and business center.""

""The president of the republic considers the entire matter as particularly serious and has issued instructions to thoroughly investigate it,"" the statement said.

Cyprus has in recent years been at pains to shake off a reputation of being in the pockets of Russian oligarchs who have concealed their assets through a maze of Cyprus-registered trusts and brass-plate companies. Russian deposits in Cypriot banks have dropped precipitously since a 2013 financial crisis brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy.

Usmanov has been subject to U. S. and European Union sanctions since shortly after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine last year.

New product acts as 'copilot for doctors',"America’s medical community appears to be embracing artificial intelligence products in an effort to speed up patient care and prevent burnout among health care professionals.

AI technology is already rolling out in doctors' offices, hospitals and clinics nationwide through a variety of formats.

California-based Regard has launched its AI product, a system that enables doctors to automate routine tasks, in 30 hospitals, its CEO said.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WON’T EVER BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THIS ONE THING

""What we started developing was essentially an AI copilot for doctors,"" Eli Ben-Joseph, co-founder and CEO of Regard, told Fox News.

The company’s software allows computers to diagnose a patient, assist with doctors' notes and alert professionals when something may have been overlooked.

The company told Fox News that the solution's ability to streamline workflows may allow doctors to spend less time on paperwork and administrative tasks.

AI AND HEART HEALTH: MACHINES DO A BETTER JOB OF READING ULTRASOUNDS THAN SONOGRAPHERS DO, SAYS STUDY

""We like to say it's almost like having an AI med student or an AI medical resident that helps the doctors with their day-to-day,"" added Ben-Joseph.

The AI medical industry is expected to grow significantly in the next several years.

The technology may save U. S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs on an annual basis, researchers found.

Separate studies, however, have indicated that the public remains cautious about embracing AI when it comes to medical care.

A survey published by Pew Research found that 60% of Americans would be ""uncomfortable"" with their health care providers relying on AI when administering services.

Conflict-plagued Sudan region reports 14 killed in 3 days,"* At least 14 people have been killed this week in Sudan's troubled Darfur region.

* West Darfur's governor has imposed a two-week state of emergency and a nighttime curfew in hopes of stemming violence.

* A 2003 insurgency by sub-Saharan rebels plunged the region into chaos, and it has remained embroiled in conflict since.

Bloodshed in Sudan's long-troubled Darfur region has left at least 14 people dead over the last three days, two activists said Tuesday.

Adam Haroun, a local activist, said clashes erupted Sunday in West Darfur province after Arab gunmen on motorcycles shot and killed a trader in the remote town of Fur Baranga.

The killing sparked a series of reprisal attacks between Arabic and African tribal groups and looting, said Adam Regal, spokesman for a local organization that helps run refugee camps in Darfur.

The violence continued Tuesday and the death toll was likely to rise, Haroun said.

On Monday, the governor of West Darfur declared a two-week state of emergency and introduced a night-time curfew across the state.

Analysts see an uptick in violence in recent month between different tribal groups across Sudan’s far-flung regions as a product of a power vacuum and tensions caused by political turmoil.

In late March, at least five people were killed in clashes in West Darfur. Last October, over 170 people were killed in clashes in Blue Nile province, situated in the remote southeast corner of the African country.

Sudan has been steeped in chaos since a military coup, led by the country’s leading Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, removed a Western-backed government in October 2021, upending its short-lived transition to democracy.

In December, the country’s ruling military and various pro-democracy forces signed a preliminary agreement pledging to reinstate the transition. Despite months of wrangling cross-party talks and several deadlines, Sudan's various political factions have yet to agree to a final deal.

The conflict in Darfur first broke out in 2003 when rebels — mostly from the region’s ethnic central and sub-Saharan African community — launched an insurgency, complaining of oppression by the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum.

China records world’s 1st human death caused by H3N8 bird flu,"A Chinese woman has become the first person to die from a type of bird flu that is rare in humans, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said, but the strain does not appear to spread between people.

The 56-year-old woman from the southern province of Guangdong was the third person known to have been infected with the H3N8 subtype of avian influenza, the WHO said in a statement late on Tuesday.

All of the cases have been in China, with the first two cases reported last year.

The Guangdong Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported the third infection late last month but did not provide details of the woman's death.

The patient had multiple underlying conditions, said the WHO, and a history of exposure to live poultry.

Sporadic infections in people with bird flu are common in China where avian flu viruses constantly circulate in huge poultry and wild bird populations.

Samples collected from a wet market visited by the woman before she became ill were positive for influenza A(H3), said the WHO, suggesting this may have been the source of infection.

COULD A BIRD FLU PANDEMIC SPREAD TO HUMANS? HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Though rare in people, H3N8 is common in birds in which it causes little to no sign of disease. It has also infected other mammals.

There were no other cases found among close contacts of the infected woman, the WHO said.

""Based on available information, it appears that this virus does not have the ability to spread easily from person to person, and therefore the risk of it spreading among humans at the national, regional, and international levels is considered to be low,"" the WHO said in the statement.

"Biden repeats long-debunked claim he ‘traveled 17,000 miles’ with Xi Jinping","President Biden repeated a long-debunked claim while addressing Ireland’s parliament Thursday, boasting that he ""traveled 17,000 miles"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""I met more with Xi Jinping than any world leader has over the last 10 years – 91 hours of just one-on-one conversations, 68 in person, I traveled 17,000 miles with him through Asia, primarily, and through China,"" the president said.

""He once asked me on the Tibetan Plateau, he said, ‘Can you define America for me?’ It's the God's truth. I said, ‘Yes, I can, in one word,"" he added. ""Possibilities.""

Biden previously made the ""17,000 miles"" the claim in November, prompting Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler to give the president a ""bottomless Pinocchio"" rating, meaning he had said it over 20 times during his presidency up to that point.

Kessler previously fact-checked Biden’s claim in February 2021, calling it ""bogus,"" saying he could only confirm one instance in which Biden and Xi appeared to have traveled together when they visited Qingchengshan High School in Dujiangyan when he was vice president in August 2011.

""This was a reference to the total travel back and forth — both internally in the U. S. and China, and as well as internationally — for meetings they held together,"" a White House official explained at the time. ""Some travel was in parallel, some was separately to joint destinations.""

"Tim Scott supports national 20-week abortion ban, would consider 15-week limit","EXCLUSIVE – Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said there’s ""no question"" he would support a 20-week federal ban on abortion and would potentially consider a 15-week limit.

Scott, a rising star in the GOP and the only Black Republican in the Senate, made news early Thursday in New Hampshire as he told local TV station WMUR that if elected president, he would support a 20-week ban on abortion. He reiterated that position a couple of hours later in an interview with Fox News at a café in Manchester — the state’s most populous city — but went a step further.

""At least 20 weeks. There’s no question that I think the 15 weeks — there’s a lot of reasons for us to understand that, the viability,"" Scott told Fox News on his second day of campaigning in the crucial early presidential nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire after launching a presidential exploratory committee.

Abortion, always an important issue on the campaign trail, took center stage following the blockbuster move last June by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority to overturn the landmark nearly half-century old Roe v. Wade ruling, which allowed for legalized abortions nationwide. The decision by the high court moved the divisive issue of abortion back to the states. Last year, following the Supreme Court ruling, Scott’s GOP colleague from South Carolina, Sen. Lindsey Graham, proposed a 15-week federal ban on abortions.

""There’s no question that the health of the child, the viability of the child, 20 weeks in my opinion is a no question. But the 15-week threshold is something that I believe is a place where you find a national limit that says ‘no more.’ States can do less. That’s got to be a state’s opportunity to do what they want to do.""

Taking questions from reporters after a stop at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, a longtime must stop for White House hopefuls from both major political parties, Scott criticized Democrats for being hypocrites on the abortion issue and took aim at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for suggesting at a Senate Banking hearing that participation in the workforce by African American women in poverty could be increased by having abortions.

TIM SCOTT TAKING NEXT STEPS AS GOP SENATOR MOVES TOWARDS 2024 RUN

""The most egregious form of restrictions are the lack of restrictions that our friends on the other side of the aisle have been voting for. They voted for late-term abortions up until the time of birth,"" Scott argued in his Fox News interview.

The senator charged that ""the most egregious form of this conversation gets so little coverage and so there’s no doubt that we have to find a threshold where we know that while the issue allows the states to be as aggressive or permissive as they want to be, I think there is the need for some kind of threshold that says we’re going to limit access to abortions for x number of weeks because we continue to see the rise of the far radical left wanting abortions up to the day of birth.""

And he emphasized that ""we can’t be a country aligned with North Korea and China,"" which allow abortions for any reasons even after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Scott, who’s co-sponsored restrictive abortions bills during his tenure in the Senate, including the 2021 Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which called for jail time for physicians who perform abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The senator, who’s reiterated when asked about abortion that he’s ""100% pro-life,"" on Thursday declined to answer when asked whether he would support legislation to prosecute doctors who performed late-term abortions.

Speaking with reporters, Scott declined to weigh in on whether medication abortions should remain legal, in the wake ruling this week by a federal appeals court that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone for now reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used, and said it could not be dispensed by mail. The Justice Department says it will ask the Supreme Court for an emergency order to put any action on hold.

""The courts are on their way to solving the problem,"" Scott said.

WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Democrats spent millions attacking Republicans over abortion ahead of last year’s midterm elections, and it was a contributing factor in turning the hoped for red wave by Republicans into a trickle. Democrats increased their razor-thin Senate majority by one seat, and while they lost control of the House, they kept their losses to a minimum. Democrats also won a number of crucial gubernatorial contests and flipped a handful of GOP controlled state house chambers. And Democrats last week won a crucial state supreme court election in battleground Wisconsin — where abortion was a top issue — by double digits.

On the eve of Scott's visit, longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley emphasized to reporters that the senator ""has supported some of the most extreme anti-choice legislation in Congress, including national abortion bans and legislation that could pave the way for banning forms of birth control.""

Scott has long highlighted his faith and has been a champion to social conservative voters, who overwhelming oppose abortion rights. He’s likely to heavily court evangelical voters, who play an outsized role in Republican politics in Iowa and his home state of South Carolina, which votes third in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

Among his stops on Wednesday in Iowa was a roundtable discussion with homeschool families. And following his visit to the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, Scott privately met with a group of pastors.

Dan Snyder reaches deal to sell Commanders for billions,"Dan Snyder’s tenure with the Washington Commanders appears to be over after nearly 30 years.

Snyder agreed to sell the Commanders to a group led by Josh Harris, the co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils, for $6 billion, Sportico reported Thursday. Snyder and Harris are reportedly hoping to execute a contract in a few days.

The Harris group also includes billionaire Mitchell Rales and NBA legend Magic Johnson.

The Commanders had no comment when reached by Fox News Digital.

NFL Network noted that nothing has been finalized and the deal has to receive approval from the rest of the league's owners.

In November, the Commanders announced Snyder hired Bank of America Securities to consider the possible sale of the NFL franchise. Snyder and his family control all shares of the team after minority partners were bought out in March 2021.

Snyder has been under fire in recent years and has faced pressure to sell the team.

The organization rebranded from the Redskins to the Washington Football Team to the Commanders as it faced pressure to make the nickname change following the racial unrest in 2020.

The NFL fined the organization $10 million and co-CEO Tanya Snyder was told to focus more on team matters after reports in The Washington Post on workplace misconduct surfaced.

Congress began investigating the team in October 2021 when allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct arose after then-Las Vegas Raiders head coach Jon Gruden stepped down following the leak of emails with then-Commanders team president Bruce Allen.

Allen was fired in December 2019 after 10 years with the franchise, of which he served in various executive roles.

The lawmakers’ investigation found that Snyder played a significant role in fostering a toxic work environment and pointed to evidence that suggested Snyder impeded the NFL’s independent probe into those allegations. Snyder refused to testify at a hearing before the House lawmakers in June as part of the investigation.

Britain to give cigarette smokers vapes in world’s 1st ‘swap to stop’ scheme,"Up to one million smokers will be encouraged to swap cigarettes for ""vapes"", with pregnant women offered financial incentives to make the change in what will be a world first, the British government said on Tuesday.

Under the scheme, almost one in five smokers will be given a vape - an e-cigarette - starter kit along with support to help quit smoking, the Department of Health (DoH) said.

Pregnant women will also be offered vouchers to help them kick the habit as part of the government's target of reducing the number of smokers to 5% or less of the population from 13% now.

""Up to two out of three lifelong smokers will die from smoking. Cigarettes are the only product on sale which will kill you if used correctly,"" Health Minister Neil O’Brien will say in a speech later on Tuesday, the government said.

""We will offer a million smokers new help to quit. We will be funding a new national ‘swap to stop’ scheme – the first of its kind in the world.""

Although worldwide average smoking rates are higher than in Britain, tobacco is still the highest preventable cause of death and illness in the country, the DoH said.

The government spent $84.52 million in 2021-22 on local authority measures to get people to stop smoking, leading to 100,000 smokers quitting, and easing the strain on Britain's overwhelmed National Health Service.

Vaping, however, has its critics and health officials have warned its popularity among children is exposing them to chemicals whose long-term effects are unclear.

Health service figures show 9% of 11 to 15-year-olds in Britain had used e-cigarettes in 2021, up from 6% three years before. The government said it would set up an enforcement squad backed by 3 million pounds in funding to prevent the illegal sale of vapes to under 18s.",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z
"Phillies’ Matt Strahm opposes extended beer sales at MLB ballparks, citing fan safety","A few Major League Baseball stadiums will be selling alcohol through the eighth inning in order to combat shorter games due to the implementation of the pitch clock.

With games roughly 31 minutes shorter this season, four teams have announced that alcohol sales will be extended beyond the traditional seventh-inning cutoff.

The Arizona Diamondbacks, Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins have all made alcohol available through the eighth inning as games have sped up, according to The Associated Press.

But not everyone is on board with the idea.

Philadelphia Phillies relief pitcher Matt Strahm joined the ""Baseball Isn’t Boring"" podcast and pushed back on extending beer sales.

""The reason we stopped it in the seventh before was to give our fans time to sober up and drive home safe,"" Strahm said. ""Correct? So now, with a faster-paced game, and me just being a man of common sense, if the game is going to finish quicker, would we not move the beer sales back to the sixth inning to give our fans time to sober up and drive home?

""Instead, we’re going to the eighth [inning], and now you’re putting our fans and our family at risk driving home with people who just drank beers 22 minutes ago.""

Rick Schlesinger, the Brewers' president of business operations, said the team will extend beer sales on an experimental basis and has not ruled out going back to the seventh-inning rule.

""If it turns out that this is causing an issue or we feel that it might cause an issue, then we’ll revert to what we have done previously,"" Schlesinger said.

MLB’s average game time is on pace to be its lowest since the 1984 season.

""When you mess with billionaires' dollars, they find a way to make their dollars back,"" Strahm continued. ""But my thing is when you’re looking at the safety of your fans, that’s probably not the smartest decision to extend it into the eighth.""

""Again, just being a commonsense thinker, I think as a fan of the game and just looking out for people, it would make more sense to stop the sales in the sixth [inning].""

"Leaked intel, found on social media, shows Ukraine more vulnerable than US claims","China has again blockaded Taiwan in a military exercise designed to intimidate not just the democratic country but western powers as well. The supposed cause was Kevin McCarthy meeting with the Taiwanese president. And while the U. S. has pledged to defend Taiwan, it’s hard not to wonder what would happen if American troops were sent to a group of islands just off China’s coast.

The Biden team tried to bury a report before Easter weekend that said it should have begun the U. S. withdrawal from Afghanistan much sooner. Administration officials, inexplicably, denied that the exit was chaotic, but one thing we know is that it was deadly, with 13 U.S. service members killed by a deadly bomb.

And now the secret American intelligence floating around social media raises a series of alarms – including how it got there – that we’re just beginning to grasp.

The intel paints a much darker picture of Ukraine’s ability to fight off the Russians. This directly contradicts the president’s reassurances that the war is going well.

Which brings to mind the phrase ""credibility gap,"" popularized during the Vietnam War. With LBJ, Robert McNamara and Gen. William Westmoreland reassuring the press and public that the war was going well, it was all the more shocking to learn that the jungle war was a disaster. Their light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel rhetoric was a pack of lies, as was clear not just from the Pentagon papers but from the desperate U. S. evacuation from Saigon in 1975.

The leaked intel documents reveal, as the Washington Post put it, ""Ukraine’s challenges in massing troops, ammunition and equipment could cause its military to fall ‘well short’ of Kyiv’s original goals for an anticipated counteroffensive aimed at retaking Russian-occupied areas this spring."" This shines a light on ""Washington’s misgivings about the state of the war.""

Even more worrisome, Volodymyr Zelensky could soon run out of ammunition for their anti-missile systems, which date to the Soviet era. How is this possible, with all the weaponry the U. S. and NATO countries have provided? Or is it just too hard to keep up with the Russian military machine?

Ukraine wants to cut off the Kremlin’s access to Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014, but its deficiencies in training and weapons ""probably will strain progress and exacerbate casualties during the offensive.""

LEAKED PENTAGON DOCUMENTS PAINT GRIM PICTURE OF UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE SUPPLIES, MAY ONLY LAST A MONTH

Fortunately, the leaked intel also says that Russia suffers from bad morale and poorly equipped soldiers.

What’s grabbing headlines now is the revelation that the U. S. spied on Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, as well as adversaries. This should come as a shock to no one, as word has dribbled out over the years that even friendly countries spy on each other. A source close to Zelenskyy told CNN that Ukraine has changed some of its military plans because of the documents becoming public.

As for the origins of the leak, the New York Times reports ""a surprisingly large number of people potentially had access to the Pentagon intelligence documents."" We’re talking about hundreds of people. That sounds like an abject failure, since these are among the nation’s most sensitive military secrets.

""We don’t know who is behind this, we don’t know what the motive is,"" national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.

Kirby also said the leaked material ""has no business, if you don’t mind me saying, on the front pages of newspapers, or on television. It is not intended for public consumption, and it should not be out there.""

That horse is already out of the barn, with major news outlets carrying a series of stories about the documents.

They first popped up last month on the social media site Discord, and went unnoticed for awhile. Discord says it is cooperating with a DOJ leak investigation.

In the old days – a few short years ago – leakers would give secret material to one or more news organizations. Those outlets would have to weigh whether some of the material would jeopardize American soldiers or operatives, and often there would be conversations with the White House.

"AOC, other pro-choicers want to ignore court ruling blocking abortion pill","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a heroine on the Left, does not like the ruling by a Texas judge directing the FDA to stop the approval of an abortion pill that was greenlit by the agency more than two decades ago.

Her solution: simply ignore it. Those are her words.

Now there are serious questions to be raised about the order by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee and opponent of abortion who would freeze the approval of mifepristone while a lawsuit challenging its safety winds its way through the courts. The Biden Justice Department has appealed.

How can a drug that’s been safely used by many Americans since 2000 suddenly be deemed unsafe? Wouldn’t that destroy the ability of the FDA or any other regulatory agency to make well-grounded decisions?

TRUMP DEFIES JUDGE WITH NEW ROUND OF STINGING ATTACKS ON PROSECUTORS

But the idea that politicians can choose to blow off court rulings they don’t like is just as dangerous, since it would – not to overstate things here – totally undermine the rule of law.

""That’s a pretty stunning position,"" CNN host Dana Bash told the New York congresswoman when she made the remarks Sunday.

AOC is hardly the only Democrat slamming the Texas decision. In fact, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, in his own CNN sitdown, would not rule out ignoring the court order, saying ""everything is on that table."" And Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, told CNN’s morning show yesterday that she agrees with taking no action on the ruling.

The South Carolina lawmaker, clearly worried about the fallout from taking too hard a line on restricting abortion, said: ""This is an issue that Republicans have largely been on the wrong side of. We have, over the last nine months, not shown compassion towards women.""

Regardless of your views on abortion, we have a judicial system that has worked pretty well since Marbury v. Madison. If you don’t like a court ruling, try to get it overturned, countersue or work to elect politicians who would name judges that share your values. I don’t see how ""ignore it"" is a viable option.

AOC argued in the interview that she does ""not believe that the courts have the authority over the FDA that they just asserted, and I do believe that it creates a crisis.""

Ocasio-Cortez insisted there was ample ""precedent"" for the executive branch to shrug off lower-court rulings, saying Donald Trump had done that very thing on lower court orders to fully restore DACA, the law protecting the dreamers that he was moving to abolish. The Supreme Court in 2020 blocked Trump’s plan on a 5-4 vote. But in that case the issue was resolved by the courts.

Even if Trump had engaged in slow-walking during the court fight, how does it help AOC’s case to say, well, the other side does it too? Such logic would lead to both parties feeling emboldened to ignore unfavorable court rulings.

AS EXPECTED, TRUMP INDICTMENT ALL ABOUT FALSIFYING RECORDS – FOR HUSH MONEY

At the same time, an Obama judge in Washington state ruled in favor of preserving the status quo for medicated abortions in the 17 states where it is now legal. So now we have dueling rulings, and this is clearly headed for the highest court.

Which brings up another point: why should a federal district judge be able to issue a nationwide injunction? Shouldn’t the authority be limited to that district? That only encourages forum-shopping. If you file a case in Amarillo, you get Kacsmaryk, because he’s the only federal judge there. AOC complained about ""deeply partisan"" judges and said the courts are ""now going rogue."" Are there no partisan judges on the other side, such as when SCOTUS was issuing liberal rulings on abortion and civil rights a half century ago? What about when the John Roberts court, in 2015, legalized same-sex marriage?

The stakes are extremely high. For decades, getting an abortion meant going to a clinic, perhaps encountering protesters, even as conservative states passed restrictive new laws. Now the availability of mifepristone means universal access, although there are legal battles to come over whether the pills can be mailed across state lines or within states banning abortion in the post-Roe era.

"Trump’s GOP rivals try to grab media coverage, but he dominates with Fox interview","Nikki Haley ranks high on the list of Republicans who don’t want to directly criticize Donald Trump.

In fact, she deflects every question about the front-runner and insists only the media are asking her about this.

But she came up with a not-so-subtle method of taking a few swipes at her rivals. It’s called the confidential memo. And I can’t exactly say it has no fingerprints.

The Haley campaign simply leaked the memo to Axios – which touted it as a scoop. An Axios reporter confirmed it came from the campaign (duh). And a leaked memo is sexier to journalists than, say, a sitdown interview.

MAJORITY OF DEMS OPPOSE BIDEN RUN

Haley has raised $11 million in six weeks, and the memo from campaign manager Betsy Ankney says: ""Donald Trump had a pretty good Q1, if you count being indicted as 'good.'""

""Still, it’s increasingly clear that Trump’s candidacy is more consumed by the grievances of the past and the promise of more drama in the future, rather than a forward-looking vision for the American people."" Perfectly fair shots – but why couldn’t Haley say these things herself? Who is she fooling? Perhaps she thinks she’s avoiding a Trump counterattack by laundering it through the press. The memo also says of Ron DeSantis that he’s ""not ready for prime time.""

Still, the memo didn’t make much news, not in this environment. Sen. Tim Scott announced a presidential exploratory committee yesterday. Which means he’s running.

The Senate’s only black Republican is an attractive candidate with a compelling life story, which he summarizes as ""from cotton to Congress.""

In a video, Scott stressed his optimistic message: ""I know America is a land of opportunity, not a land of oppression. I know it because I lived it."" But given the nature of today’s GOP, Scott has to be regarded as a long shot. And as more Republicans jump in, they increase the chances of Trump cruising to the nomination as they divide the opposition vote.

BIDEN FADES FROM NEWS AMID TRUMP MELODRAMA

Both Haley and Scott got a sliver of the coverage that Trump attracted, not surprisingly, by sitting down with Fox’s Tucker Carlson.

The former president was full of provocative responses, such as saying he’ll stay in the race even if he’s convicted in the Stormy Daniels case. When he was brought in for the arraignment, ""They were actually crying. They said ‘I'm sorry.’ They'd say ‘2024, sir, 2024.’ And tears are pouring down their eyes.""

Will Joe Biden stay in the race?

""Look, I watch him just like you do, and I think it's almost inappropriate for me to say it. But I deal with other people. I don't see – I don't see how it's possible.

And it's not an age thing.""

Then what is it?

Trump delivered his standard riff about the president being surrounded by ""smart"" but ""vicious"" left-wingers, as if Biden isn’t really in charge.

In a particularly strange series of exchanges, Trump said Biden ""is not top of the line"" and then proceeded to praise dictators around the globe.

Vladimir Putin? ""Very smart,"" said Trump, despite the fact that he has decimated his military and committed countless war crimes by invading Ukraine.

"AI model Sybil can predict lung cancer risk in patients, study says","Recent artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the ability to accurately predict an individual's future lung cancer risk, according to researchers.

In a study published earlier this year, a team of international researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital — as well as in Taiwan — said the Sybil AI model only needed a single low-dose CT (LDCT) scan to ""further enable personalized screening.""

An LDCT scan is the only recommended screening test for lung cancer. During the scan, patients lie on a table and an X-ray machine uses a low amount of radiation to make detailed images of the lungs.

The study's authors developed Sybil using scans from the National Lung Screening Trial, including those with a range of smoking history. It can run in real time in the background on a radiology reading station.

AI’S ABILITY TO LEARN POSES CHALLENGE TO REGULATORS, COMPANIES: 'A LITTLE BIT SCARY'

The group found that it was shown to accurately predict whether a person will develop lung cancer in the next year 86% to 94% of the time, and up to 81% of the time within six years.

However, they noted that future study is required to understand Sybil's clinical applications.

Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer in the U. S., accounting for 23% of all deaths. In 2020, more than 136,000 people died of lung cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of those deaths were in men.

BE WELL: REDUCE YOUR COLON CANCER RISK WITH REGULAR SCREENINGS

""It’s the biggest cancer killer because it’s relatively common and relatively hard to treat, especially once it has reached an advanced stage,"" Dr. Florian Fintelmann, Massachusetts General Cancer Center thoracic interventional radiologist and co-author, said in a statement. ""In this case, it’s important to know that if you detect lung cancer early, the long-term outcome is significantly better. Your five-year survival rate is closer to 70%, whereas if you detect it when it’s advanced, the five-year survival rate is just short of 10%.""

Lung cancer screening programs are underdeveloped in regions of the U. S. hardest hit by lung cancer due to a variety of factors, and Sybil was able to find — being trained both with scans with visible cancerous tumors and some without discernible signs — where the cancer was when humans couldn't see it.

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Finland's president warns country's new status as NATO member 'doesn't solve every problem',"Finland's President Sauli Niinistö on Thursday warned that the country's new status as a NATO member ""doesn't solve every problem,"" and said Helsinki should not let down its guard on security issues.

""We still bear the main responsibility for our own security. Wherever we detect any gaps or vulnerabilities, they must be fixed,"" Niinistö said, in a speech to lawmakers as they gathered for the first time since the April 2 elections.

He added that Finland, which shares a 832-mile border with Russia, has been focused on regional security in the past year, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""We must not let this level of alertness drop in the future, either,"" the president said as he formally opened the 200-member Eduskunta legislature. ""We should better understand how organically the dangers and tensions we are witnessing here are linked with the increasing geopolitical pressures.""

Finland’s main conservative party came first in this month's elections, after a tight three-way race that saw right-wing populists take second place. Sanna Marin, the head of the Social Democrats that came in third, stepped down as prime minister as her hopes for reelection were dashed. No new government has been formed.

Neighboring Sweden also applied for NATO membership in May 2022.

"Mothers passed COVID to babies through placenta, possibly causing brain damage, death","Two mothers who gave birth at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, passed along the COVID-19 infection to their newborns through the placenta, researchers at the University of Miami Health System and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have found.

In both cases, the infection caused brain damage in the babies, according to a press release summarizing the findings from the study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics on April 6.

Although both babies tested negative for the COVID-19 virus at birth, they experienced ""seizures, small head sizes and developmental delays,"" the press release said.

COVID-19 VACCINE DOES NOT DAMAGE PLACENTA IN PREGNANCY, STUDY FINDS

One of the babies died suddenly at 13 months old.

Tests found that the babies had ""significantly elevated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies"" in their blood, which means either the antibodies crossed the placenta or the babies contracted the virus and produced their own antibodies.

The press release indicated that both pregnant women tested positive for COVID during their second trimesters, then recovered and tested negative.

Yet one of the women contracted the virus again during the third trimester.

This is the first study to show the transmission of COVID through the placenta resulting in brain damage in infants, the press release said.

Dr. Merline Benny, assistant professor of pediatrics and a neonatologist at the University of Miami, was the first author on the paper. She told Fox News Digital that she was surprised by the findings.

This was the first study to detect COVID crossing the placenta into a baby’s brain.

""The presence of the virus in the brain/organ of an infant had never been shown before,"" she said. ""The infants reported were two extreme cases we saw in the NICU [neonatal intensive care unit].""

COVID VACCINES ARE NOT NEEDED FOR HEALTHY KIDS AND TEENS, SAYS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

The hospital has had more than 350 infants born to COVID-positive mothers, and the vast majority of them were fine, Dr. Benny noted. Only a handful of the infants had any symptoms.

Dr. Ken Perry, an emergency physician in Charleston, South Carolina, was not involved in the study but reviewed the findings. He said the most surprising result was the fact that the outcome has been shown only in two patients.

""I do not believe this is a common finding that is occurring,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""The findings of microcephaly [small head size], as well as low Apgar scores [a scoring system used to determine a newborn’s color and breathing] are not common. If they had become more common during COVID, this information would definitely have been shared across pediatric hospitals.""

He added, ""This is a very concerning set of symptoms, especially if it can be directly connected with COVID.""

RECORD-BREAKING TWINS BORN FOUR MONTHS EARLY DEFY ODDS: ‘GOD WAS IN CONTROL’

Earlier in the pandemic, the researchers observed other, less severe issues — such as short-term lung disease and high blood pressure — in babies born to COVID-positive mothers.

In those cases, it wasn’t clear whether the problems stemmed from inflammation or from COVID crossing the placenta.

In addition to signs of the virus and ""severe inflammatory changes"" in the two placentas, the researchers found ""major changes"" in the brain of the baby who passed away.

""I was struck by the unexplained severity of the loss of the white matter and the presence of features of hypoxia/ischemia in the cerebral cortex,"" said Dr. Ali G. Saad, a Miller School professor, neuropathologist and director of the pediatric and perinatal pathology service at Holtz Children’s Hospital, in the press release discussing the findings.

""We became suspicious that the virus, somehow, managed to breach the placental barrier to damage the central nervous system, but this had not been documented before,"" he added.

Dr. Benny reiterated that these two cases of brain injury were highly unusual.

""The vast majority of infants were asymptomatic, so we don't want parents to panic,"" she said. ""This study was targeted at raising awareness among obstetricians, neonatologists and neurologists. However, it is important to conduct further research to study the long-term outcomes in these infants.""

""We don't want parents to panic.""

If a mother is infected with COVID during pregnancy, Dr. Benny recommends monitoring for any developmental delays in the infants.

""If there are any developmental delays noted, they should report it to their pediatrician for further neurological and neurodevelopmental monitoring,"" she said.

""The standard practice in our NICU is to screen all babies born to mothers who test positive with a respiratory swab for PCR [COVID test] starting at 24 hours of life.""

The biggest takeaway for pregnant women, Dr. Perry said, is to not become too nervous about these results.

""Pregnancy is stressful enough without adding another level of stress for pregnant mothers,"" he said.

Given that there were only two infants involved in the study, Dr. Perry doesn’t think it’s necessary for patients to change their habits as of now.

""With these few patients, we are only able to discuss association rather than causation,"" he said.

""There are some similarities between these patients that could account for these outcomes rather than COVID.""

He also said, ""It is important for medical professionals to appropriately evaluate and integrate this data rather than change the normal standard of care. The best thing to do while pregnant is to ensure that mothers are getting appropriate prenatal care.""

For example, the study hypothesizes that the issues stemmed from inflammatory changes in the placenta.

""The best way to monitor this in utero is to have appropriate ultrasounds done to monitor the health of the placenta,"" Dr. Perry said.

""At this time, we do not have much information on maternal COVID during pregnancy and its long-term effects on the infant into childhood and adolescence,"" Dr. Benny told Fox News Digital.

""Conducting such studies into the long-term effects of COVID would be very important.""

Dr. Perry said this research should be followed by additional studies that include many more patients, allowing for better control of independent variables.

""This will allow for a discussion of causation to actually occur, which will guide recommendations going forward.""

The researchers plan to look for the specific ""biomarkers"" that indicate babies who are at a higher risk of having adverse effects from maternal COVID.

Researchers recommend that pregnant women get the COVID vaccine.

To prevent any issues from occurring, the study authors recommend that all women get vaccinated against COVID-19 before or during pregnancy and that they practice ""standard COVID precautions.""

Breastfeeding is also recommended as a means of boosting babies’ immunity, as COVID-19 antibodies have been found in breast milk.

Ultimately, Dr. Perry said the best option is for a patient to have a conversation with her doctor.

Top Peruvian politician gets 12 years for journalist's 1988 murder,"A Peruvian judge convicted retired army general and conservative politician Daniel Urresti and sentenced him to 12 years in prison Thursday for his role 35 years ago in the murder of a journalist who covered abuses during Peru’s civil war.

Hailed by advocates as an overdue but key verdict in upholding accountability and press freedom in Peru, the sentence represented a remarkable turnaround for Urresti, who has been an interior minister, congressman and presidential candidate as well as a frequent political commentator.

Urresti was a military intelligence officer in November 1988 when journalist Hugo Bustíos was machine-gunned and blown up with dynamite in a slaying initially blamed on the communist militant group Shining Path. A fellow journalist with Bustíos survived the attack.

Members of the military later were convicted of carrying out the ambush during a plainclothes patrol in Huanta province to prevent the journalist from covering news of military abuses against civilians in the largely indigenous region. The man who had been the local military commander was convicted in the attack in 2007, and he implicated Urresti as a member of that patrol in 2011.

Judge Juan Santillán issued the sentence Thursday in Lima as Urresti listened along with his wife and daughter, whom he hugged before being taken into custody by the police. Prosecutors had requested 25 years, but said they were satisfied with the decision. Urresti indicated he would appeal.

Sharmelí Bustíos, daughter of the murdered journalist and his late widow, told reporters that after 35 years, ""I can tell my parents that they can finally rest in peace.""

The National Association of Journalists said in statements on social media that the verdict was restitution both for the family of Bustíos and for journalism. ""It is an important step towards justice and the defense of press freedom in Peru,"" the group said.

Urresti was a popular interior minister in 2014-15 under President Ollanta Humala, with a reputation for being outspoken and taking a hard line against crime. He served in Peru’s Congress in 2020-21.

POLICE OFFICER IN PERU ATTACKED, BURNED TO DEATH AS MOB PROTESTS OUSTER OF PRESIDENT CASTILLO

The conviction against the politician came only after a second trial. He initially was acquitted in a verdict that was annulled in 2019 by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial saying that the previous process had been riddled with errors.

The Huanta province capital, also called Huanta, about 370 miles southeast of Lima, was one of the most violent cities during the war that raged between the Peruvian military and the Shining Path from 1980 to 2000.

Herminia Oré, who represents disappeared and tortured people of that city, told a journalist from The Associated Press in 2015 that there was an atmosphere of paranoia in Huanta during the conflict. ""A candle lit in your house at night was a reason for the military to arrest you,"" she said.

"NFL, NFLPA approve new helmets for quarterbacks in latest step to combat concussions","A new helmet specifically designed to help protect quarterbacks has been approved by the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).

The NFLPA said the push to develop the Vicis Zero2 Matrix quarterback helmet was based on the fact that ""half of all QB concussions occur when their helmets hit the ground.""

Although the helmet is expected to be available by next season, signal-callers will have the option of using the same headgear they used in 2022.

Tests showed that the new Vicis Zero2 Matrix helmet ""performed 7% better than the most popular helmet worn by quarterbacks last season,"" according to a memo sent to team executives on Thursday.

NFL data noted that almost half of the quarterback concussions were a result of helmet-to-ground impacts, including the one suffered by Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa last season.

FATHER OF EX-NFL PLAYER PHILLIP ADAMS WHO KILLED 6 SUES SON’S ALMA MATER OVER LACK OF HEAD TRAUMA TREATMENT

""We've now analyzed with our engineers and with the Players Association more than a 1,000 concussions on field, we have a pretty good database of how these injuries occur,"" NFL executive Jeff Miller told the Associated Press about the helmet-to-ground impacts.

""This helmet performs better in laboratory testing than any helmets we have ever seen for those sorts of impacts.""

Jason Neubauer, an executive for Vicis, said the company began designing its Zero2 Matrix QB helmet in early 2022.

""The unique thing is that it has a deformal outer shell, which means when you take an impact in any location on that helmet, it will deform or basically dent in that location to absorb the impact,"" Neubauer said.

""What that means for us, as designers or engineers as we're looking to optimize it for different types of impacts, we're able to change unique locations to try to optimize the impact mitigation in any one area.""

It remains unclear how many quarterbacks will make the switch to the new QB-specific helmet. The league and the NFLPA share information from the helmet studies with teams so that players can make informed decisions on helmet choice.

The only other position-specific helmet already approved is the Vicis Zero2-R Trench for offensive and defensive linemen.

The memo sent to teams also includes the results of the 2023 helmet laboratory testing study. Miller told the AP that seven helmets the league highly recommended in 2020 have been downgraded to prohibited as a result of new testing.

""That's a great sign,"" Miller said. ""Hopefully, we can continue to stimulate that either with position-specific helmets designed for each position group or for a general all-purpose helmet, to be able to say to players, 'Work with us, be willing to change helmets, because better and better products are coming online every year.'""

Odell Beckham Jr. makes pitch to Lamar Jackson amid contract battle,"Odell Beckham Jr. is officially a member of the Baltimore Ravens, but who he’ll be catching passes from next season is still very much up in the air.

At his introductory press conference Thursday, Beckham said he received no assurances from Lamar Jackson that the former MVP would be his quarterback next season.

""Didn't get any assurances for anything. You know, life's uncertain,"" Beckham said, according to NFL Network. ""I think that we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day. We only know what's happened in the past.""

Jackson revealed he requested a trade from Baltimore March 2, days before the Ravens placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on the quarterback before the deadline.

But the uncertainty at the quarterback position did not stop Beckham from signing a one-year, $15 million deal in Baltimore after sitting out the entire 2022 season with a knee injury.

Though the three-time Pro Bowler is clearly hoping Jackson is under center when the Ravens kick off the 2023 season.

""Lamar, if you’re watching, I would love to get to work with you,"" Beckham said as he waved at the camera.

Jackson aided in Beckham’s recruitment, and the two went to dinner and a club after Beckham agreed to the deal, according to ESPN.

""Lamar's in our plans. We love Lamar,"" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said Thursday, per ESPN. ""Our feelings about Lamar have not changed one bit since the end of the season.

"Hunter Biden firm sought Irish government investments while Biden was VP, raising questions about Ireland trip","FIRST ON FOX: President Biden’s embattled son was invited to accompany his dad and aunt to Ireland this week, despite continued scrutiny over the Biden family’s foreign business dealings and dual investigations.

In 2011, Hunter's partners at his now-defunct investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners discussed making contacts to expand their energy investments in various state-owned investment funds, including in China, Ireland, Oman and Qatar, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.

On March 8, 2011, Eric Schwerin, the firm’s former president, sent Hunter and then-CEO Devon Archer an email containing the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute’s (SWFI) current list of the top sovereign wealth fund, which are state owned, and their rankings at the time.

""Let's discuss today what else we can be doing to connect with these groups,"" Archer responded, adding that Rosemont Seneca was ""already working"" with several funds on the list, including two in China.

BIDEN'S CLAIM TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS IS BECOMING HARDER TO MAINTAIN

""China Social Security-following up with Jonathan Li to see if there's viability,"" Archer wrote to Schwerin and Hunter, referring to the National Social Security Fund in China, which had over $146 billion in assets at the time, according to the SWFI list, and Hunter’s Chinese business partner, Li, whom Biden briefly met in China more than 2 years later.

In December 2013, then-Vice President Biden traveled to Beijing due to a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Hunter expressed interest in joining his father on the trip and ended up going, where he admitted to the New Yorker that he introduced his father to Li, who ran the Chinese private-equity fund Bohai Capital.

According to the report, Hunter arranged for a brief handshake in the lobby of the hotel where the U. S. delegation was staying and then Hunter met up with Li privately.

Archer’s March 2011 email to Hunter and Schwerin added he was scheduling a meeting for that April with the China Investment Corporation, China’s largest sovereign wealth fund that manages part of the government’s foreign exchange reserves.

The SWFI list said CIC had over $332 billion in assets at the time of Archer’s email.

Another sovereign wealth fund mentioned on the SWFI list was the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) in Ireland, which had $33 billion in assets at the time. The NPRF was a public pension fund that later became the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) in 2014, according to Investopedia.

Archer suggested that someone from Rosemont Seneca reach out to Dan Rooney, the then-U. S. ambassador to Ireland, who was appointed by Obama in 2009, in order to gain connections to the Irish government.

""Ideas we could follow-up on,"" Archer wrote. ""Ireland- ask for intro through Rooney.""

VP BIDEN'S OFFICE TRIED TO QUASH BLOOMBERG STORY ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN AT HIS FIRM'S REQUEST, EMAILS SHOW

Schwerin then suggested to Devon and Hunter that an informal meeting with Rooney could be arranged during the St. Patrick's Day festivities in Washington, D. C., the following week.

""Ireland - I assume there may be some opportunities to informally connect to Rooney, et. al. at the St. Patrick's Day stuff next week and then formally follow up afterwards?""

Archer then joked that they should use a mashup video of comments by Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen as their ""pitch.""

""We should use this in our pitch,"" he said, linking to the video.

Fox News Digital asked the White House whether it was aware of the 2011 email before the Ireland trip, or whether it could guarantee Hunter would not use the trip to further his financial interests, but it declined to respond.

It is unclear whether Hunter and his now-defunct firm were successful with any potential business ventures in Ireland. Rooney passed away in 2017.

News of the email comes as Biden travels Ireland with Hunter, and his sister and former campaign manager, Valerie Biden Owens, on his first presidential trip to Ireland to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.

The Bidens boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Tuesday and headed for the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast for a four-day tour of the country in an effort to ""keep the peace"" in the region.

Biden's transparency criticized by Americans,"People in Nashville weighed in on President Biden’s growing rift with the White House press corps and his administration’s transparency since taking office.

""He doesn't answer any questions,"" one man, David, told Fox News. ""I honestly just don't think he's in charge of the country.""

Kerry, however, said, ""I think we still get all the information we need to. Maybe he just isn't looking for the spotlight as much as others may have.""

The White House press corps grew frustrated with the president after hearing he would forgo a formal news conference during his four-day trip to Ireland this week. Biden has done only 23 press conferences since taking office, compared to 41 by President Trump, 53 by President Obama and 45 by President Bush at this point in their administrations.

Another man, Robert, said, ""Nobody really knows what's going on anymore.""

""The press corps travels with him, right?"" David said. ""I think all the media sources are getting frustrated, because they can't report on anything.""

The reporters pushed back on Biden’s lack of transparency in a Monday press conference, with one reporter asking whether the administration was ""trying to protect the president"" from their questions.

REPORTERS ERUPT ON JEAN-PIERRE OVER BIDEN NOT TAKING QUESTIONS FROM PRESS POOL: ‘THAT’S NOT TRUE'

""Certainly the president, many times, has stood in front of all of you, has taken questions on his own because he wanted to see what was on your minds. . . . That has happened multiple times, many times, during this administration. And that will certainly continue to be. When it comes to a formal press conference, I don't have anything to share with you at this time,"" she said.

Michael, visiting Nashville from Connecticut, said the press secretary’s response was ""laughable.""

""They won't let him talk to anybody – do any interviews. Donald Trump answered so many questions. Biden won't answer anything,"" he said.

""I think we all know that he doesn't run the show,"" another man, Matt, said. ""His handlers pretty much take care of everything that he does.""

Buenos Aires locals bemoan homeless encampments overrunning major airport,"At the start of the long Easter weekend, the airport in Argentina’s capital is eerily quiet before dawn, hours before it will fill with travelers. About 100 people who sleep inside the facility are getting ready to start their day.

One of them is Ángel Gómez, who has been living in the Jorge Newbery International Airport for two years and has seen how the number of people joining him has soared.

""After the pandemic, this became a total invasion,"" Gómez said early Thursday as he sat next to a sign that advertised the Perito Moreno glacier, an iconic tourist attraction in Argentine Patagonia.

The airport, known colloquially as Aeroparque, has practically become a homeless shelter at night. It’s a stark reflection of the rising poverty in a country where some of the world’s highest inflation rates are making it difficult for many to make ends meet.

""If I pay rent I don’t eat, and if I pay for food I’m on the street,"" said Roxana Silva, who has been living at the airport with her husband, Gustavo Andrés Corrales, for two years.

Silva gets a government pension of around 45,000 pesos, which is equivalent to $213 at the official exchange rate and about half of that in the black market.

""I don’t have enough to live on,"" Silva laments, explaining that she and her husband take turns sleeping so that someone is always watching their stuff.

More and more Argentines are finding themselves in Silva’s situation, as the country’s inflation clocked in at an annual rate of 102.5% in February. Although Argentina has been used to double-digit inflation for years, this marked the first time the annual rise in consumer prices reached triple digits since 1991.

The high inflation, which has been especially pronounced in basic food items, has hit the poor the hardest and pushed the poverty rate to 39.2% of the population in the second half of 2022, an increase of three percentage points from the first six months of the year, according to Argentina’s national statistics agency, INDEC. Among children under age 15, the poverty rate increased more than three percentage points to 54.2%.

Horacio Ávila, who runs an organization devoted to helping homeless people, estimates the number of people without a roof in Argentina’s capital has soared 30 percent since 2019, when he and others carried out an unofficial count of 7,251 people in this city of around 3.1 million.

Amid the increased cost of living and diminishing purchasing power, more people started to look to the airport as a possible refuge.

Laura Cardoso has seen this increase firsthand in the year she has been living in the airport ""sleeping sitting up"" on her wheelchair.

""More people just came in,"" Cardoso said while accompanied by her two dogs that she says make it difficult for her to find a place to live because no one wants to rent to her. ""It’s packed with people.""

EL SALVADOR’S GANG CRACKDOWN STRETCHES TO ONE-YEAR MARK WITH NO SIGN OF SLOWING

Mirta Lanuara is a new arrival, living in the airport only about a week. She chose the airport because it’s clean.

Teresa Malbernat, 68, has been living in the airport for two months and says it’s safer than being in one of the city’s shelters, where she says she was robbed twice.

The Argentine company that operates the airport, AA2000, says it ""lacks police power"" and ""the authority to evict these people"" while also saying it has the obligation to ensure ""non-discrimination in the use of airport facilities.""

For Elizabet Barraza, 58, the sheer number of homeless people living in the airport illustrates why she’s choosing to emigrate to France, where one of her daughters has been living for five years.

Colombia's Petro fires police chief who claims he used exorcisms to catch fugitives,"Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday removed the national police director who had talked about using exorcisms to catch fugitives.

Neither Petro nor the Defense Ministry elaborated on reasons for the dismissal of Gen. Henry Sanabria, a staunch Catholic who was appointed by Petro in August of last year. But Sanabria was under an internal investigation by the ministry over whether he had inappropriately allowed his religious beliefs to infringe on his duties.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES TRILATERAL DEAL WITH PANAMA AND COLOMBIA TO STOP DARIEN GAP MIGRATION

Sanabria had unleashed a debate about the impact of his faith on the police after his statements in an interview last month including that police had used exorcisms to catch drug kingpins and guerrilla leaders. He also issued a strong condemnation of abortion, which is legal in Colombia.

Although Colombia is a predominantly Catholic country of conservative and religious traditions, it is a secular state under its constitution. Petro, who was sworn in as the country’s first-ever leftist president last August, said that Sanabria would never be persecuted over his religion, but that there must be separation between religious beliefs and the state.

Interior Minister Alfonso Prada said Wednesday that Sanabria’s departure had nothing to do with his expressions of his religious beliefs, since the government respects freedom of thought. He said only that the dismissal was part of a new start for the national police force.

In a Twitter message, Petro thanked Sanabria for his work without referring to the reason for his removal.

Sanabria will be replaced by a retired general of the police force, William Salamanca, who currently is Colombia’s consul in Miami.

In an interview in Semana Magazine last month, Sanabria said that the police forces carried out exorcisms to catch top leaders of drug trafficking gangs and guerrilla groups.

He also spoke out strongly against abortion, which has been legalized in Colombia by the Constitutional Court since February of last year. Sanabria said that abortion is a ""very serious sin"" because it implies ""killing a little person who is being formed.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z

LEAKER OF CLASSIFIED US INTELLIGENCE WORKS ON MILITARY BASE, POSTED THE DOCUMENTS ON DISCORD: REPORT

REP. MIKE WALTZ: I find this far more serious, more significant than what we're hearing from the White House. And what jumped out at me is that we have this massive security infrastructure within the Defense Department, our intelligence and our intelligence community, secure, compartmented facilities by the thousands, secure I. T. systems, security background checks that take months, if not years, and all of this costs billions and billions of dollars. Yet, this seems to have been done so simply. And it really drives me as a member of the intelligence community, from an intelligence committee, from an oversight standpoint, to look at that infrastructure, how much money we're spending on how effective is it, really? And then also, all of the insider threat programs that supposedly were put in place since the Snowden leaks. At the end of the day, we've built these massive forts kind of around our classified intelligence, as we should. Yet, it's the insiders that seem to be the biggest threats. And that's what I want to dig into when we get back to Washington and start conducting oversight.

BIDEN SAYS FEDS 'GETTING CLOSE' TO FINDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT LEAKER

President Biden said Thursday that the U. S. is ""getting close"" to finding the person responsible for leaking Pentagon documents that the Department of Defense has described as containing ""sensitive and highly-classified material.""

"Weight loss in older adults associated with risk of death, study shows","Weight loss in older adults may increase their risk of death, according to new research.

A cohort study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Monday looked at more than 16,000 adults in the U. S. and Australia.

The authors from the University of Melbourne, Monash University and others said weight loss in healthy older individuals was found to be associated with an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and ""other life-limiting conditions.""

""Physicians should be aware of the significance of weight loss, especially among older men,"" it said.

WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATIONS OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY: WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU STOP TAKING THEM

Study participants, recruited between March 2010 and December 2014, were 70 years and older in Australia and 65 years and older in the U. S.

Data analysis was performed from April 2022 to September 2022.

The adults were weighed annually, with researchers warning physicians to be aware of the ""significant association"" between relatively minor weight loss of more than 5% and mortality.

Older men who lost between 5%-10% of weight — compared to those who had stable weight — had a 33% higher risk of mortality, and those who lost more than 10% of weight had a 289% higher chance of mortality.

Women who lost between 5%-10% of their weight had a 26% higher chance of mortality, and those who lost more than 10% had a 114% higher chance.

The authors posited that the observation that weight loss was associated with mortality among men may be the result of the different body composition characteristics of men and women.

For example, men have a higher percentage of body muscle than body fat compared to women.

They said that a ""likely"" explanation for the findings is that weight loss can be an early premonitory indicator of the presence of various life-shortening diseases, noting that weight loss in this age group was largely associated with a reduction of appetite.

Those who gained weight did not show an increased risk of mortality in the group.

Jim Nantz defends broadcasting partner Tony Romo amid criticism,"Tony Romo faced a significant amount of criticism over his abilities in the broadcasting booth this past season, specifically during the postseason, but play-by-play partner Jim Nantz spoke out this week in defense of the former NFL quarterback and their chemistry.

During an appearance on Sports Illustrated’s ""SI Media With Jimmy Traina,"" Nantz said the criticism Romo faced was ""a misinformation attempt"" which seemingly only began during the playoffs.

""I think there was a little bit of a misinformation attempt there to portray him in a not-so-favorable light,"" Nantz said. ""It was very disappointing. It really got, to me, more steam after the AFC Championship Game, which was our last game. And for the life of me, I didn’t understand it.""

The New York Post reported in February that CBS executives met with the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback following the 2021 season in what was described as an ""intervention,"" but the network denied the characterization, explaining that it regularly meets with all of its on-air talent.

The report also called into question Romo’s chemistry with Nantz, but the legendary analyst set the record straight this week, calling Romo one of his ""best friends.""

""Tony is the best. He’s the absolute best. And he’s also one of my best friends. I love the guy. And when somebody starts questioning our chemistry, there’s an agenda there,"" Nantz said on the podcast.

Romo and Nantz were in the booth for the divisional-round matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals, but viewers took to social media to seemingly criticize Romo’s every remark.

Nantz defended Romo’s unique style in the booth and noted that the majority of the focus followed their broadcasts in the postseason.

""We didn’t do any of these games in January any different than we did during the regular season. So, why all of a sudden are people taking cheap shots? I don’t get it.""

Nearly 100 paper mill employees could be infected,"Nearly 100 people have likely contracted blastomycosis in an outbreak at the Billerud Paper Mill in Escanaba, Michigan, according to numerous reports and a press release from Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties (PHDM).

Blastomycosis is an infection caused by a fungus called Blastomyces, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As of April 10, there were 19 confirmed cases and 74 probable cases among employees of the paper mill, per the press release.

FRIGHTENING NEW FUNGUS 'CANDIDA AURIS': WHAT IS IT? WHO IS SUSCEPTIBLE?

Health agencies are still working to identify the source of the exposure. The fungus thrives in moist soil and decomposing wood and leaves, according to the CDC.

About a dozen of the mill’s employees have been hospitalized, as local outlets reported.

The PHDM was first notified of several pneumonia infections among mill employees on Feb. 28, with the first symptoms beginning in January and February.

On March 3, Billerud learned of the infections from the PHDM.

""Early testing has indicated that these infections may be caused by a fungal infection called blastomycosis,"" the PHDM stated in the press release. ""Additional testing to confirm these results may take a couple of weeks and is underway.""

It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months for symptoms to appear after exposure to the fungus, per the CDC.

The Billerud Paper Mill began operations in 1911. It employs 885 people, nearly 100 of which could be infected with blastomycosis.

The mill produces up to 730,000 tons of paper per year, according to a fact sheet on its website.

It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months for symptoms to appear.

The facility is located in Escanaba, a small community in Delta County in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

""The health and safety of our employees, including those who support and visit our mills, is always our first priority,"" said Brian Petersen, the mill’s vice president, in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""From the moment we became aware, we have been leveraging all available public health resources and other professionals to quickly understand any and all measures we can take to support our colleagues and implement proactive steps toward prevention,"" he went on.

Peterson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Billerud has provided its employees with N95 masks, hired an ""industrial hygienist"" for guidance, deep-cleaned high-traffic areas throughout the mill and inspected ventilation systems and replaced filters.

Local and national health agencies investigating the outbreak include PHDM, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Mike Snyder, health officer for Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties, told Fox News Digital that because this is an ongoing investigation, the agency is not making any statements at this time, aside from its weekly press releases.

The Blastomyces fungus is found in the midwestern, south-central and southeastern U. S., predominantly in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, per the CDC.

People can contract blastomycosis by breathing in ""microscopic fungal spores,"" the CDC states on its website.

For most people, the fungus does not cause illness.

Some, however, will develop symptoms including fever, cough, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue, joint pain, muscle aches or weight loss.

Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person.

Those with compromised immune systems face a higher risk of the infection spreading into their skin, bones, joints and central nervous system, per the CDC.

""Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person or between animals and people,"" stated the press release from PHDM.

Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist and co-medical director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D. C., said that because Blastomyces live in the soil, outbreaks of blastomycosis have been reported after people engage in construction, excavation or other activities that disturb the natural habitat of the fungi.

There is not currently a vaccine for blastomycosis.

""As long as humans continue to engage in deforestation for the expansion of civilization, it’s likely that we will continue to experience outbreaks of blastomycosis in the United States,"" she told Fox News Digital.

There is not currently a vaccine for blastomycosis.

If a person has a job that involves disturbing soil and develops symptoms of the infection, the CDC recommends seeing a health care provider for early diagnosis and treatment with prescription antifungal medication.

Additionally, the CDC says any infected employees should contact their employers’ occupational health, infection control, risk management or safety/security department.

Because the fungus that causes blastomycosis is common in the environment of some areas, limiting exposure can be difficult.

Those who have weakened immune systems may want to avoid areas where the soil is disrupted, the CDC says.

The PHDM recommends wearing personal protective equipment, including face masks or respirators, eye protection and gloves, to reduce the risk of inhaling the fungal spores when working in areas where soil may be disturbed.

Additionally, the agency recommends avoiding moving or digging soil on windy days, only moving leaf litter when it is dry, covering soil and yard materials, ensuring adequate drainage of water, and installing walkways over wet areas to avoid walking through muddy soil, as stated in its press release.

Petersen, Billerud's VP of operations, said the mill's operations are running uninterrupted and that they are continuing to service customers.

""Billerud is continuing to monitor cases to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and visitors,"" he said.

""We will continue to closely communicate with local union leaders, mill workers, state and local public health officials, and our communities as we learn new information.""

Father of ex-NFL player Phillip Adams who killed 6 sues son’s alma mater over lack of head trauma treatment,"Alonzo Adams, the of father of former NFL defensive back Phillip Adams, is filing a lawsuit against the college where his son played football.

Adams fatally shot six people just over two year ago, before killing himself. An autopsy later revealed that Adams suffered from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease that some research has suggested is linked to head injuries and blows to the head.

CTE has also been shown to cause violent mood swings, and memory loss in some cases. Adams' father is arguing that his son's alma mater, South Carolina State University, failed to adhere to protocols. He also believes the university did not have enough highly trained staff members available to treat the sustained head trauma that Adams suffered throughout his college football career.

That alleged ""negligence, carelessness, recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness"" contributed to Adams’ death following the April 8, 2021, mass shooting in Rock Hill, South Carolina, according to the wrongful death lawsuit filed March 31. Police found Adams with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

University spokesman Sam Watson said that school does not comment on current or pending litigation.

The NFL journeyman also sustained ""head trauma"" during his six years as a professional cornerback, according to the complaint. During a three-game span with the Raiders in 2012, Adams had two concussions.

The local coroner said the family told investigators that Adams complained of excruciating injury-related pain, had issues with his memory and struggled to sleep.

His sister told USA Today after the killings that the family had noticed concerning signs of rapidly deteriorating mental health like an escalating temper and lack of personal hygiene.

Because he didn’t retire by 2014, he would not have been eligible for testing included in a broad settlement between the league and former players over long-lasting concussion-related injuries.

More than two years later, Kelly appeared on Barstool Sports’ ""Bussin’ With the Boys"" podcast and said he didn’t fake a Southern accent.

""No, I mean, who would – that’s the stupidest thing to try to do,"" he said. ""Listen, when you have a Boston accent, I mean, and you’re in the Midwest, and you go down South, you’re going to be all messed up anyway.

""I think I have a bit of a strange accent anyway. So add another one, I think it’s crazy anyway.""

'Friday Night Lights' star Minka Kelly details shocking childhood,"Minka Kelly is revealing details of her ""chaotic"" and ""unstable"" childhood — raised by an exotic dancer — in a shocking, upcoming memoir.

The actress, now 42, shares stories of her mother, ""Mo,"" taking her to strip clubs as a child, physical abuse and getting pregnant at 17. The memoir, ""Tell Me Everything,"" is set to be published May 2.

""My childhood was colorful and chaotic, unstable and inconsistent, unpredictable and hard a lot of the times,"" Kelly told People magazine. ""But the silver lining is that it made me a very adaptable person.""

The actress grew up in poverty and often unsupervised as her mother worked as an exotic dancer to make ends meet. Mo would sometimes take the young child with her to the Crazy Girls strip club in Los Angeles, and they'd go grocery shopping at 2 a.m. afterward if Mo made enough money, according to People.

‘EUPHORIA’ STAR MINKA KELLY, LIKE SYDNEY SWEENEY, PUSHED BACK AGAINST NUDE SCENES: ‘WE CAN KEEP MY DRESS ON’

At the age of 17, Kelly performed in peep shows at an adult video store in New Mexico — to make ends meet while her mother wasn't around, the outlet reported.

""I started with the scariest part,"" Kelly told People of her decision to write about the peep show in first part of the memoir. ""The part that I carried the most shame about, the part that I felt the most embarrassed of, the part that I hid my whole life, and the part that I've had people make me feel bad about. And I felt like that was just where I had to be the most brave.""

Kelly also found out she was pregnant at the age of 17 with her high-school boyfriend, Rudy. The actress moved in with Rudy at the time but later chose to have an abortion.

Kelly recalled making the decision after her mom suggested they raise the baby together.

""Raise this baby together, how?"" Kelly wrote, according to excerpts obtained by Page Six. ""With what money? What home? What insurance? I couldn’t imagine bringing a baby into what my mother brought me into. Absolutely not.""

""That was it. In that moment, I knew the right choice,"" she added. ""Raising a child with my mother would only continue this family trauma, another cycle added to so many generations of pain. Hadn’t there been enough damage already?""

The ""Just Go With It"" star detailed her toxic relationship with Rudy, explaining that he had coerced her into making a sex tape, which he later sold back to her for $50,000 after trying to sell it to the tabloids.

""I hardly even remembered making the tape,"" she wrote in the book. ""I’d become such a master at leaving my body when things were uncomfortable.""

Kelly had moved to New Mexico with her mother to live with Mo's boyfriend, David. According to Kelly, he beat her after Mo told him the actress had been ""borrowing"" the car.

""He hit me with an open hand, then a fist, over and over,"" Kelly claimed. ""He found a piece of cable wire on the floor and started thrashing me with it as I curled into a ball to protect what parts of myself I could. ... He yanked my hair, pulling me around the room by my ponytail. ... How long the beating continued, I don’t know. Welts were rising all over my skin when he finally exhausted his fury.""

Kelly recalled him asking for a hug after the beating.

""'You a--hole,' I wanted to say,"" she writes. ""'You f--king monster!' I wanted to cry and scream and tell them both to go f--k themselves, but that would only make it worse. I held it in.""

Kelly returned to Los Angeles after finishing high school and studied to become a surgical technician while acting. She was also able to reconnect with her father, a former guitarist for Aerosmith.

Kelly also wrote about her toxic relationship with ""Friday Night Lights"" co-star Taylor Kitsch in the memoir. She landed the role of Lyla Garrity on the drama, which ran from 2006 to 2009.

""All the effort I might have invested in connecting consistently with the girls on the show went to Taylor. So when my relationship with Taylor became toxic, I had no one to turn to,"" she revealed.

""Life became very difficult both on and off set whenever we broke up. We were young and had very few tools to handle our emotions and personal grievances. On the days we had to work together and were broken up, he didn’t want to be in the hair and makeup trailer at the same time I was.""

"Princess Margaret endured ‘a deep sadness’ on her deathbed over ‘forbidden’ lover Peter Townsend, doc claims","Princess Margaret spent her final days reminiscing about her true love.

The claim was made by George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, in a new ITVX docuseries titled ""The Real Crown: Inside the House of Windsor."" The five-part documentary aims to examine the struggles the British royal family has endured over the years.

Carey, who was Archbishop between 1996 and 2002, revealed in the documentary that he visited Queen Elizabeth II’s younger sister on her deathbed in 2002.

""She was sad,"" he recalled, as quoted by U. K.’s Daily Mail. ""There were moments when she expressed that sadness.""

""Here is a woman who longed for love and commitment, and the love of her life was forbidden from her, and there was a deep human sadness in that,"" he shared.

The princess first met Peter Townsend in 1947 when she was 17 years old. She quickly fell head over heels for the dashing World War II fighter pilot who was married with two sons.

A year after Townsend divorced his first wife, he proposed to Margaret, who was 16 years his junior, in 1953. At the time, divorcées weren’t allowed to remarry in the Church of England. Margaret also required her sister’s permission to marry before the age of 25.

Despite the couple’s love for each other, the much-decorated war ace was banished from Buckingham Palace on the advice of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill to a diplomatic post in Brussels. Still, the romance survived, at least until 1955. At the time, Margaret was 25 and third in line to the throne. That year, she ended her engagement with Townsend.

""I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage,"" Margaret said in a statement to BBC Radio at the time.

""But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others,"" she shared. ""I have reached this decision entirely alone, and in doing so I have been strengthened by the unfailing support and devotion of Group Captain Townsend.""

After the couple called it quits, Townsend moved to Belgium before settling down in France. Then in 1959, he married Marie-Luce Jamagne.

""[Margaret] could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up everything – her position, her prestige, her privy purse,"" Townsend later reflected in his 1978 memoir. ""I simply hadn’t the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.""

In 1960, Margaret became engaged to Antony Armstrong-Jones. It was a quick engagement, with the couple saying, ""I do"" mere months later. But the union wasn’t to last. The pair divorced in 1978, two years after they separated.

Townsend died in 1995. He was 80.

Looking back, Carey said he believed that Margaret died with a ""deep sadness"" about her lost love.

""I talked to her quietly and said a prayer, anointed her with the oil, and she died soon after that,"" he said. ""It was a lovely moving occasion.""

"Marburg virus ‘will not become the next pandemic’ but should be monitored, doctor says","Amid reports of two confirmed Marburg virus outbreaks in the African countries of Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released an alert last week for U. S. doctors to keep an eye out for any potential cases.

""Currently, the risk of MVD [Marburg virus disease] in the United States is low; however, clinicians should be aware of the potential for imported cases,"" the CDC stated in the alert.

""It is important to systematically assess patients for the possibility of viral hemorrhagic fevers.""

The CDC defines the Marburg virus — which has been compared to the Ebola virus — as a ""rare but severe hemorrhagic fever, which affects both people and non-human primates.""

Fox News medical contributor and NYU Langone internal medicine specialist Dr. Marc Siegel appeared on the Fox News Channel to share his perspective on the virus.

The Marburg virus isn’t new — it was first discovered in 1967, when outbreaks happened in labs in Marburg and Frankfurt (both in Germany) and in Serbia (formerly Belgrade, Yugoslavia).

However, Dr. Siegel said more sustained outbreaks are happening where it used to be sporadic.

""This is a virus that comes from bats — it’s very similar to Ebola,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday, April 10.

The Marburg virus is spread by the Egyptian fruit bat, which is found in both Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, per the CDC.

""We saw a pretty big outbreak in Tanzania, which it looks to me like they’ve gotten control over, as very few people are being quarantined now,"" said Dr. Siegel. ""But in Equatorial Guinea, there’s a problem.""

Symptoms of Marburg include nausea, vomiting, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the CDC stated.

More severe cases can lead to inflammation of the pancreas, jaundice, delirium, severe weight loss, shock, hemorrhaging and organ failure.

Due to its similarity to the Ebola virus, the CDC recommends that doctors follow the same protocols for infection prevention and control when dealing with cases of the Marburg virus.

Dr. Siegel expressed concern that the governments of the countries where the Marburg outbreaks have occurred aren’t sharing the full details.

""It’s the usual problem — they’re not telling us anything.""

""It’s the usual problem — they’re not telling us anything,"" he said. ""They’re hiding cases. There have probably been at least 29 deaths.""

Dr. Siegel also condemned the World Health Organization (WHO) for not reacting appropriately.

""The World Health Organization, as usual, is limp — not doing what they’re supposed to be doing here, which would be to get a vaccine in there,"" he said.

Dr. Siegel noted that there is a vaccine for the Marburg virus — and that the recommended course of action would be to conduct a ""ring vaccination"" around the people who are most affected.

With the ring vaccination approach, a vaccine is given to a person who is exposed to a virus, along with anyone else who has been in close contact with that person, per WebMD.

This strategy was used to help end the smallpox outbreaks in the mid-1900s.

One piece of good news that Dr. Siegel shared: Unlike the COVID-19 virus, the Marburg virus does not spread through the air.

""It’s pretty stable, so it doesn’t mutate the way we saw with COVID,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends.""

""It spreads through close contact through secretions.""

Secretions include bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, plasma, semen and urine.

""But it is a horrible virus and it causes a pretty high death rate,"" Dr. Siegel noted. ""We definitely need to keep an eye on it, because we don’t want to see any cases here [in the U. S.] — but we don’t have control of the situation.""

""And again, I’m disappointed in both the WHO and the local governments, because it can clearly spread around Western Africa,"" he added.

Dr. Siegel was clear: He does not think the Marburg virus will become the next pandemic, as ""it’s too stable to mutate in that direction.""

""In nature, this is not going to cause a pandemic.""

He did express concern, however, about viruses being ""played with"" in the lab.

""I can’t tell you 100% that something won’t happen in a lab,"" he said. ""That’s where my concern is. But in nature, this is not going to cause a pandemic — it’s only going to cause sporadic outbreaks. And it can be controlled, as it just was in Tanzania.""

Vice President Kamala Harris was just in Tanzania a couple of weeks ago, said Dr. Siegel — but there's a ""really low chance"" that she would have been exposed.

Reduce your colon cancer risk with regular screenings,"Colorectal cancer is becoming more prevalent among younger people and at more advanced stages, recent studies have shown.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) has found that one in five diagnoses are in people younger than age 55. Advanced disease affects three in five people.

These shifting patterns highlight the importance of screening and early detection as life-saving measures.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer seen in both men and women in the U. S., according to data from the American Cancer Society.

DISTANT-STAGE COLON CANCER SHOWING UP MORE IN YOUNGER ADULTS, STUDY SAYS

This year alone, it is estimated there will be 106,970 new colon cancer diagnoses and 46,050 new cases of rectal cancer

Dr. Kyle S. Eldredge, a general and colorectal surgeon in Wellington, Florida, said that in people over 50 years old, the overall incidence of colorectal cancer actually has been dropping over the last three decades due to increased screening.

""However, for people younger than 50, the incidence has been increasing by 1-2% per year since the 1990s,"" he told Fox News Digital.

It’s predicted that by 2030, colorectal cancer will be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among people ages 20 to 49.

""The exact reason for this increase in younger persons is unclear, but it is thought to be linked to diet, lifestyle and the gut microbiome,"" said Dr. Eldredge.

Although diagnoses have skewed younger in recent years, age is the biggest risk factor of colorectal cancer — over 90% of cases are diagnosed in those older than 45, noted Dr. Eldredge.

Age is the biggest risk factor of colorectal cancer.

""Family history is another important risk factor — having a single first-degree relative with colorectal cancer can increase your risk two- or three-fold,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Other risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease — ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease — which are inherited disorders that lead to increased polyp growth, [as well as] smoking, obesity and alcohol intake.""

In many people, early-stage colorectal cancer doesn’t cause symptoms, Dr. Eldredge said.

AI TESTING OF BRAIN TUMORS CAN DETECT GENETIC CANCER MARKERS IN LESS THAN 90 SECONDS, STUDY FINDS

Yet it’s important to know the warning signs. These include changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, bloody stool, weakness and fatigue, rectal bleeding, anemia due to blood loss and unexplained weight loss.

""The most effective way to prevent the development of colorectal cancer is through screening,"" said Dr. Eldredge.

""Early-stage cancer starts as noncancerous polyps. Through screening and removal of these polyps, the risk of colorectal cancer can be reduced by 75% to 85%.""

The ACS recommends that screening should start at age 45 for those persons at average risk.

Early screening is the best way to lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

""The most effective screening method is via colonoscopy, which uses a camera to directly visualize the colon,"" said Dr. Eldredge. ""Any polyps that are found can be removed.""

The ACS recommends that people of average risk get a colonoscopy every 10 years.

For higher-risk people who have a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, Dr. Eldredge recommends increasing the frequency to every five years.

Another type of visual screening test is the CT (computed topography) colonography, which uses a computer to capture three-dimensional images of the colon and rectum.

There are also stool-based studies that are not as invasive, but need to be done more frequently.

""Although each test has its advantages, the best test is the one that gets done,"" said Dr. Eldredge.

UN agrees to hear century-old Venezuela-Guyana border dispute case,"The United Nations' highest court ruled Thursday that it can hear a case between South American neighbors Guyana and Venezuela about a border dispute that dates back to 1899.

The decision to reject Venezuela's challenge to the case's admissibility means it will go ahead at the International Court of Justice, though will likely take years to resolve.

The ruling was a second defeat for Venezuela's attempts to have the case tossed out. It came more than two years after judges rejected a challenge by Caracas to the world court's jurisdiction.

In the admissibility challenge rejected Thursday, Venezuela had argued that the court could not hear the case without the involvement of the United Kingdom, which was Guyana's colonial master at the time of the original border decision. The Guyanese side had argued that Britain ceased to have any involvement in the case once Guyana gained its independence in 1966 and that Venezuela was using its argument as a delay tactic.

Guyana President Irfaan Ali welcomed Thursday's ruling and underlined his country's commitment to resolving the dispute peacefully.

""Guyana remains confident that its longstanding international boundary with Venezuela will be confirmed by the court,"" Ali said in a statement.

INDIAN ARMY GENERAL SAYS SITUATION ON BORDER WITH CHINA IS 'UNPREDICTABLE'

The territorial dispute dates back to an arbitration award by an international tribunal in 1899 that drew the border between the two South American nations largely to the favor of Guyana, which was then a British colony. The Tunisia-sized swath of jungle west of the Essequibo river in the dispute is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources.

Guyana took the case to the world court in 2018 after years of fruitless mediation failed to resolve the dispute. In its case, Guyana asks the court to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding on both countries.

Mozart Prevot was detained Tuesday by National Police officers who also searched his residence in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where they found a 9mm pistol and ammunition, the National Police said on the agency's website. Prevot has not been charged.

HAITIAN PRESIDENT JOVENEL MOÏSE ASSASSINATED AT HOME, OFFICIAL SAYS

Prevot was the driver of former Haitian Sen. John Joel Joseph, who is currently facing charges in the United States related to the 2021 assassination.

Joseph, a political rival of the slain president, was extradited from Jamaica to the U. S. last May to face a charge of conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping outside the United States and other charges. He faces a possible life sentence.

According to a report from Haiti’s National Police, at least one person identified Joseph as one of the leaders in the assassination plot. The source said Joseph paid cash for rental cars that other suspects used and met with them ahead of the killing.

China opts out of UN wildlife survey aimed at preventing future pandemics caused by animals,"China is not participating in a United Nations project to survey Asian wet markets and other facilities at high risk of spreading infectious diseases from wild animals to humans, despite long-running talks with Beijing, a UN official told Reuters.

China's hesitancy to join the UN project involving other Asian nations may compound frustration by global researchers who have been pressing Beijing to share information about the origins of COVID-19, as they seek to prevent future pandemics due to zoonotic, or animal-to-human, disease transmission.

Four Asian countries - China, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos - were initially selected for the survey by the scientific advisory committee of the project, called the Safety across Asia For the global Environment (SAFE), because they host multiple facilities presenting risks of animal-to-human disease transmission, the UN official said.

FBI DIRECTOR SAYS COVID PANDEMIC 'MOST LIKELY' ORIGINATED FROM CHINESE LAB

The selection for the project, launched in July 2021, was also made after major wildlife trafficking cases were detected, investigated and prosecuted in those countries, which increased zoonotic risks, the official said.

""China was initially in discussions to be part of the project,"" the official said, declining to be named as the information was deemed sensitive.

The official said discussions with China are still ongoing, but did not clarify with which state institution the UN project is holding talks.

China's foreign ministry and the country's National Forestry and Grasslands Administration (NFGA), which oversees the management of wildlife and was involved in initial talks with the project organizers, did not respond to requests for comment.

The official said NFGA initially showed interest in the project but eventually declined to join, saying it was not under its remit. The agency did not indicate which government agencies would be responsible for the matter, the official said.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which monitors illegal wildlife trafficking and coordinates the SAFE project, had no immediate comment.

After a strain of coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, many researchers suspected it spread in a live animal market there.

China has since banned the sale and consumption for food of wildlife animals. Despite the ban, experts warn risks still remain.

HOUSE GOP TO REQUIRE BIDEN TO DECLASSIFY INFO ON WUHAN LAB, COVID ORIGINS

""There are glaring holes in the restrictions that still pose a zoonotic disease risk,"" said Peter Li, China Policy Specialist for Humane Society International, a Washington-based non-profit organization.

He said China still allows wildlife breeding on a massive scale for fur trade, traditional medicine, pet trade and for entertainment or display in low welfare conditions.

China's public security organs have handled more than 70,000 criminal cases involving wild animals from 2020-2022, confiscating 1.37 million wild animals in the process, state news agency Xinhua has reported.

The country's revised wildlife law, designed to close regulatory loopholes, is due to take effect in May, according to the National People's Congress website.

The SAFE project surveys only began in October last year, when the project's assessors visited Khao Kheow zoo and a cafe in Thailand. Another dozen surveys have been conducted in the country since then.

The goal is to boost pandemic prevention and preparedness, the official said, noting the results of the surveys would be solely shared with the participating governments.

After China effectively dropped out from initial talks, it was replaced with the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island, according to the list of participating countries posted on the official website of the project.

About 40 facilities in each participating country are to be surveyed to identify potential risks of disease transmission.

The facilities to be surveyed include restaurants, wet markets, biomedical supply facilities, zoos and breeding facilities. The wet markets targeted are markets where wild animals are sold alongside fresh meat and vegetables.

Vietnam and Laos have yet to approve the surveys. The UN official expected the formal greenlight from the two countries over the coming weeks or months. Malaysia's Sabah has authorized the field visits.

A second UN official, from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which implements the project, said practices that can increase disease transmission risks include lack of hygiene, mixing of different animal species and the use of overcrowded cages.

The project, which is funded by the European Union and will run until July 2024, could be expanded to involve the World Health Organization (WHO) if public health considerations are identified, the first UN official said.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Germany allows Poland to give Ukraine 5 old MiG-29 fighter jets,"Germany has approved Poland's request to export five old MiG-29 fighter jets to bolster Ukraine's air power against the Russian invasion, the German defense ministry said on Thursday.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said the request had arrived Thursday, and that Berlin's same-day approval showed that Germany could be relied upon.

INSIDE THE MASSIVE OPERATION TO TRAIN THOUSANDS OF UKRAINE TROOPS AHEAD OF SPRING COUNTEROFFENSIVE

Germany inherited 24 MiG-29 jets from the East German GDR during reunification in 1990. At the time, the aircraft were seen as among the most advanced fighter jets in the world.

In 2004, Berlin passed on 22 of the aircraft to Poland. Of the remaining two jets, one was destroyed in a crash and one is on show at a museum.

Poland needs Berlin's consent to send its remaining jets to a third country.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said during a visit to Warsaw last week that Poland would help form a coalition of Western powers to supply warplanes to Kyiv.

Sanders asked a couple of questions, but was reassured that he could remain in the trailer and wait for Ralphie to return. As the buffalo began racing back to the trailer at full speed, Sander shouted, ""Oh no!""

""Oh no I'm not standing here while this thing is coming at me full speed!""

""Ralphie was intimidating,"" Sanders said toward the end of the video. ""That was intimidating.""

Deion Sanders Jr. posted a YouTube link of the legendary NFL player's meeting with Ralphie saying, ""Coach Prime FINALLY Faces His Biggest Fear!""

Sanders seemed to be able to have a good laugh about the ordeal and wrote, ""Ok I was SCCCCCCARED"" in a tweet.

NFL Draft prospect Michael Jefferson undergoes multiple surgeries after involvement in fatal car crash,"A 2023 NFL Draft prospect was involved in a fatal car crash in Alabama on Sunday and needed to undergo multiple surgeries, his agent said.

Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin’ Cajuns wide receiver Michael Jefferson was considered to be a mid-round pick when the draft kicks off in late April.

But the draft is unfortunately not the top priority right now. His agent told ESPN that Jefferson has serious injuries from the car crash in Mobile. The nature of those injuries has not been disclosed.

A man was pronounced dead at the crash site when Alabama law enforcement arrived, per TMZ. It was a 55-year-old man in a 2014 Dodge Charger who wasn’t wearing his seat belt when he collided head-on with Jefferson’s 2019 Chevy Impala. That collision led to a 2008 Nissan Maxima also hitting Jefferson’s vehicle.

The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is investigating the crash.

NFL VETERAN'S COMMENT TO CJ STROUD COULD HINT AT PANTHERS' PLANS FOR NO 1 OVERALL DRAFT PICK

Jefferson, a 6-foot-4-inch, 199-pound receiver, had a solid senior season with the Ragin’ Cajuns in 2022. He hauled in 51 receptions for 810 yards with seven touchdowns over 12 games.

For his career at Louisiana-Lafayette, he totaled 1,291 yards on 69 catches with 11 touchdowns.

At the NFL Draft Scouting Combine, Jefferson posted a 4.56-second 40-yard dash time with a 1.52-second 10-yard split. He also showcased a 37-inch vertical jump and 11-foot-1-inch broad jump.

""Jefferson is a tall target with build-up speed and a receiving style that gets better the further he gets from the line,"" NFL.com Draft analyst Lance Zierlein wrote. ""He doesn’t have the short-area quickness to elude NFL press effectively and could struggle to uncover against tight man coverage over the first two levels. He has decent ball skills and works into the zones effectively, but he will have a challenging time making an NFL roster.""

5 things you might not know about Academy Award-winning star,"As a comedian, musician, actor, filmmaker and father, Jamie Foxx is beyond a triple threat.

The 55-year-old actor earned top industry accolades and won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the 2004 film ""Ray,"" but Foxx has been performing nearly his entire life.

His daughter, Corinne Foxx, revealed Wednesday that Foxx suffered a ""medical complication"" the day before, and ""quick action and great care"" helped guide him toward recovery. His family has not disclosed Foxx's medical issue.

""Nothing further is being provided from the family at this time,"" Foxx's representatives told Fox News Digital Thursday.

JAMIE FOXX SUFFERS ‘MEDICAL COMPLICATION,’ DAUGHTER CORRINE SAYS: ‘HE IS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO RECOVERY’

Production crews in Atlanta reportedly shut down filming his latest project, ""Back in Action,"" Wednesday, but resumed on Thursday ""using a stand-in for Foxx on set,"" a source told People. A scene scheduled for Sunday has also reportedly been canceled due to ""changes in production.""

With more than 30 years of entertainment industry experience under his belt, here's a look at five things you might not know about Jamie Foxx.

He was a natural comedian and loved telling jokes from a young age.

Foxx was dared to perform at an open mic night, and he immediately fell in love with stand-up comedy.

""It was the most incredible feeling,"" he told Texas Monthly. ""It was, ‘OK, I think I know what I want to be right now.’""

He noticed that women were usually called to the stage first, so he changed his name to something more ambiguous and gender-neutral.

WILL JAMIE FOXX'S COMEDY ‘ALL-STAR WEEKEND’ SUCCUMB TO CANCEL CULTURE?' EXPERTS WEIGH IN

Born Eric Marlon Bishop, he became known as Jamie Foxx.

He picked the moniker as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx, a pioneer in the civil rights movement who found television success portraying Fred G. Sanford on ""Sanford and Son.""

On the ""Redd Foxx: We've Come to Join You"" podcast, Jamie discussed his name change as an ode to one of the greats.

""It was a tip of the hat to him that I chose that name, and the name stuck, and I have to be thankful to him for blazing the trail as a comedian and allowing me to sort of ride on his coattails,"" he said.

Jamie grew up in a religious household. He was adopted by his grandmother, Estelle Talley, when he was a baby after his biological parents rejected him.

JERRY SEINFELD RETURNS FOR ‘COMEDIANS IN CARS’ WITH NEW GUESTS JAMIE FOXX, SETH ROGEN AND MORE

Talley began taking Foxx to piano lessons when he was 5, and by the time he was 13, he was the musical director at a local Baptist church. He told Texas Monthly that he earned $75 each Sunday, saying, ""Church is big time!""

He continued to pursue piano throughout high school, which landed him a scholarship at the U. S. International University in San Diego, where he studied classical music and composition.

The keys also helped him with side hustles, and he sang in a ""terrible"" R&B band called Leather and Lace while in school.

With his career exploding with roles on ""In Living Color"" followed by his own sitcom, ""The Jamie Foxx Show,"" and then working in movies alongside Robin Williams in ""Toys"" and with Will Smith in ""Ali,"" Foxx got into the studio to show off his vocal range for his first album, ""Peep This.""

One decade later, he was featured on the 2003 Kanye West and Twista song, ""Slow Jamz,"" which reached No.1 on the Billboard 100, and then again with West on ""Gold Digger."" The hit included a Ray Charles-inspired hook of ""I Got a Woman,"" somewhat foreshadowing his future work with the acclaimed pianist.

JAMIE FOXX SAYS DIRECTOR ONCE CALLED HIM ‘HORRIBLE,’ KICKED HIM ‘THE F--K’ OUT

His second album, ""Unpredictable,"" was released in December 2005 and received Grammy nods, but it was his third album in 2008, ""Intuition,"" that turned the music world upside down.

""Blame It,"" featuring T-Pain, earned Foxx his first Grammy. He's been nominated a total of 10 times.

When ""Ray"" director Taylor Hackford approached Jamie about playing the role of the legendary musician Ray Charles in 2004, Hackford didn't know about Jamie's instrumental background and was blown away by Foxx's talent.

""Taylor didn’t know that I play piano, so he said, ‘I gotta figure out a way to shoot your face and then shoot somebody else’s hands playing.’ And I said, ‘No, no, I actually play. I’ve been playing since I was 5.’ That opened up a whole different thing,"" Foxx told the Jazz Times.

""Since I can play, we could stay in the same frame and shoot through the playing of the music and the singing at the same time, which was a huge plus.""

Foxx's world was turned upside down when his younger sister, DeOndra Dixon, died in October 2020. She was 36.

He wrote on social media at the time that his heart ""is shattered into a million pieces."" Foxx added DeOndra ""transitioned"" and said ""she will always be alive… anyone who knew my sis… knew that she was a bright light.""

Foxx continued, ""I can’t tell you how many times we have had parties at the house where she has got on the dance floor and stolen the show... even gave her boyfriend @chrisbrownofficial a run for his money... well I know she is in heaven now dancing with her wings on...tho my pain is unbelievable I smile when I think of all of the great memories that she left me... my family... and her friends.""

Jamie's sister danced in the ""Blame It"" video and also on the Grammys. He was proud of her accomplishments, especially becoming the ambassador to the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.

Shortly after her death, the foundation created the DeOndra Dixon Fund in her honor. Foxx told Extra two months after DeOndra died that their family was ""getting along"" as best they could.

""It was so much pain, man. My mother, my father and my sister, they all live with me. It was so much pain,"" he said.

The nonprofit sent a message of support to Jamie Thursday.

Dixon began participating in the Special Olympics in the sixth grade. She competed for nearly a decade and moved from her native Texas to California, where she lived with Foxx after graduating from high school in 2002.

""I feel I was born to dance. I want to be a professional dancer,"" Dixon’s foundation bio said. ""My brother has given me a chance to do some special things. I danced in his video ‘Blame It.’ I’ve danced on stage at some of his concerts all over the country. And guess what? I’ve danced at the Grammys!""

Jamie received an Academy Award for ""Ray"" the same year that he was nominated for best supporting actor in ""Collateral.""

He starred as a Los Angeles cab driver turned hostage by a hitman on a killing spree (Tom Cruise) in the neo-noir action flick directed by Michael Mann.

The star-studded cast included Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, and the film grossed more than $220 million at the box office. Months after its release, Cruise went public about his relationship with Katie Holmes.

Holmes and Cruise were married six years and have one daughter, Suri Cruise. They divorced in 2012.

Foxx and the ""Dawson's Creek"" star reportedly began dating in 2013 but kept their romance out of the spotlight for years.

They made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in 2019, six years into their relationship.

Weeks later, they were both single again.

Jamie helped Cameron Diaz come out of retirement with their latest film, ""Back in Action.""

People may still be able to access abortion pills if FDA loses US court battle,"* A separate federal judge in Washington issued an order to maintain mifepristone’s availability in contradiction to a Texas judge’s effort to suspend its approval

* The FDA could say it can’t satisfy both judgements, allowing the agency to preserve the status quo

* Because abortion pill mifepristone also has a strong safety record, the FDA would not be pressured to remove the abortion drug from the market

The U. S. Justice Department is racing this week to convince a federal appeals court, or possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, to put on hold a judge's order suspending the government's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, which is used in more than half of all abortions in the country.

But even if those legal efforts fail and last Friday's order by U. S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas goes into effect, essentially rendering the drug unapproved, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could nonetheless continue to allow access to the drug, legal experts say.

The FDA, responsible for protecting public health by assuring safety, efficacy and security of drugs, is also facing an order issued minutes later on Friday by a separate federal judge in Washington state, barring the federal agency from changing the availability of mifepristone.

PRO-LIFE REPUBLICANS SAY FDA APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL WAS ILLEGAL, ASK APPEALS COURT TO UPHOLD INJUNCTION

The contradictory rulings may give the FDA reason to preserve the status quo while the government's appeal proceeds and declare that drug companies and doctors won't face legal risks for making or prescribing mifepristone, experts said.

""One way in which the FDA could comply with this is to do nothing, to use its enforcement discretion to say we can't satisfy both judgments,"" said Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law.

The FDA can demand that manufacturers remove unapproved drugs from the market and if a manufacturer fails to comply, the agency can take the drugmaker to court.

But the agency also has to make best use of its resources and has a history of not taking action when there is low risk to the public. The FDA has estimated that there are thousands of drug products marketed illegally without agency approval, including those that were available prior to the passage of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938.

In 2011, the agency issued guidance for prioritizing action against unapproved drugs and said it would focus on those that present potential safety risks, are ineffective, are fraudulent, or are formulated to avoid FDA enforcement.

The FDA, which has said it stands behind it determination that mifepristone is safe and effective, declined to comment.

Sources told Reuters the Biden administration is planning steps to support mifepristone manufacturers.

The FDA approved mifepristone, which is the first of a two-drug regimen to terminate a pregnancy within the first 10 weeks, in 2000.

On Friday, Kacsmaryk suspended FDA approval of mifepristone in response to a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups claiming that the agency approved the drug using an unlawful process and did not adequately consider its safety. Minutes later, U. S. District Judge Thomas Rice in Spokane, Washington, blocked the FDA from making any changes to the current availability of the drug. His ruling applies in the 17 states and the District of Columbia that sued the government seeking to loosen the special safety restrictions around the pill.

Both rulings apply while the cases proceed, and are not on the merits of each case.

Kacsmaryk put his ruling on hold until Friday to give the Biden administration, which supports access to abortion, time to pursue its appeal.

SCHUMER SAYS JUDGE'S MIFEPRISTONE ABORTION PILL RULING ‘COULD THROW OUR COUNTRY INTO CHAOS’

But, even if the abortion pill's approval remains suspended, the FDA has precedent on its side to do nothing, legal experts said.

""They don't have to drop everything and remove mifepristone from the market,"" said Evan Bernick, a professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law. ""They haven't done that with other drugs, they've prioritized on the basis of safety risk, and mifepristone has a strong safety record.""

Forty years ago, prison inmates sentenced to death by injection sued the FDA because the agency refused to prevent the administration of certain drugs in executions, which allegedly violated their approved use.

The case, known as Heckler v Chaney, found its way to the Supreme Court which ruled unanimously in 1985 that judges should not review the FDA's decisions about allocating resources.

""I would hope the administration would recognize this as an opportunity to do what they have been saying they would do, which is take all steps available to them to maintain access to this drug,"" said Phil Katz, an attorney for mifepristone maker Danco Laboratories, which is also appealing the Texas ruling.

An attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the plaintiffs in the Texas case, said if Kacsmaryk's ruling takes effect manufacturers cannot make mifepristone and it would be ""extremely dangerous"" for the FDA to suggest otherwise.

""The whole problem here is that FDA didn't follow regulations and rulemaking in the first place,"" Denise Harle said.

Kacsmaryk briefly discussed the 1985 case in his Friday ruling, saying the FDA ""cannot shield their decisions from judicial review merely by characterizing the challenged action as exercising 'enforcement discretion'.""

Rebouche said she did not think Kacsmaryk's discussion of the 1985 case had any bearing on the FDA's authority.

""The FDA’s enforcement discretion is established by prior precedent,"" Rebouche said. ""That case law would have to be overturned, which is not impossible but would be a major upending of federal agency authority.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"As India inches closer as world’s most populous nation, interest in birth control continues to decline","Pratima Kumari, a government health worker in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, sets off on her mini scooter every morning, crisscrossing vast corn fields and pineapple orchards to visit villages and meet young, married couples.

She offers condoms and birth control pills for free in the Kishanganj district and talks to the couples about birth control and the benefits of having just two children.

But it's mostly been a losing battle in Kishanganj, which has the highest fertility rate of any district in India, soon to be the world's most populous nation.

""The minute I tell couples to use condoms or suggest permanent birth control, they ignore it or just change the topic,"" Kumari told Reuters.

Kishanganj, and Bihar, are exceptions in India, which has over decades controlled its population growth.

The national fertility rate, or the number of children a woman has on average, fell to 2.0 in 2019-21, just below the replacement rate of 2.1, official data shows.

But Bihar, one of India's least developed states, had the highest fertility rate of 2.98. State health officials estimate Kishanganj's fertility rate at 4.8 or 4.9.

Successive state governments have been aware of the population growth problem, particularly in Kishanganj, and have mounted programs to curb it.

Besides the free distribution of condoms and birth control pills, the state pays $36.50 to women who get sterilized and $48.80 to men. Health workers who get people sterilized are paid $6.10 per surgery.

Yet the results have been poor.

""I talk to women while they are experiencing labor pain and nudge them to undergo sterilization immediately after delivery,"" said Parvati Rajak, a medical officer in one of Kishanganj’s seven government health centers.

""But the final choice is always made by the family,"" she said, minutes after helping a woman deliver her fifth child.

Jahan Sheikh, a mother of four and pregnant for the fifth time, said she was not in favor of sterilization .

Sheikh said her mother-in-law told her it was good to have at least five children as they would help in the farm and at home.

""I don’t know but getting a sterilization operation makes me nervous. What if there are problems after the surgery? Who will take care of my kids,"" she asked.

A 2021 Bihar planning and development department report said the state had a sterilization target of 871,307 people in 2020 but managed just 401,693 or 46%..

Men refused to undergo sterilization as they thought the procedure would harm their masculinity, health workers say.

In Kishanganj, only 0.2% of the male population was sterilized while it was 22.8% for the female population, the state government report said.

Just minutes after giving birth to her fifth child at a government clinic in Kishanganj, Zamerun, the wife of a mason, said she would try to secure permission from her husband to undergo sterilization before leaving for home.

""My body cannot take this pressure of having babies anymore,"" she told Reuters. ""I have been lucky to survive each time.""

Her husband later said he had agreed, and Zamerun was sterilized .

Reuters spoke with 14 women and six government medical officers for this report and eight of the 14 women said their families expected them to have at least five children.

""For the fourth time I have had a girl...now I will wait for a few years before I try to have a boy,"" said Chandani Devi, 36, as she tried to fight back tears in a hospital ward after her delivery.

Her newborn girl was lying next to her and nurses were helping her feed the weak baby.

Senior government officials said they faced an uphill task.

""We are doing our best but in a democracy one can only do this much...we cannot dictate rules on family planning,"" said Tejashwi Yadav, Bihar's deputy chief minister who holds the health portfolio and has eight siblings.

Sanjay Kumar Pansari, director in the Bihar government's Directorate of Economics and Statistics, said the state’s fertility rate is slowly showing signs of decline.

""The state government's focus is to ensure that policy interventions percolate to the ground, its mechanisms such as free sterilization , temporary birth control instruments are used actively,"" Pansari told Reuters.

""The problem is people shy away from using them and we need to continuously remind them about it.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z
Japanese baseball stadium where Babe Ruth wowed crowds at center of environmental debate,"A Japanese baseball stadium where Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx and Lou Gehrig played in 1934 when American stars went on tour is at the center of a climate battle in the country.

Meiji Jingu Stadium in Tokyo opened in 1926 and is currently the home of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball. The facility is in an area known as Meiji Gaien, a green patch in central Tokyo famous for an avenue lined with 150 ginkgo trees.

Ruth hit several home runs in front of 60,000 fans.

However, the stadium could be demolished along with a nearby rugby stadium to make room for skyscrapers and a shopping area. The stadiums would be moved elsewhere.

The entire plan has sparked a debate among government officials, residents and environmentalists.

""I really think we shouldn't sacrifice nature in order to get short-term economic growth,"" Natsuka Kusumoto, a university student who is against the redevelopment. ""In order to stop global warming we have to face how to balance economic growth and nature conservation.""

She added that developers, construction companies and Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike ""don't hear the voice of the people who live in this town.""

""Around this area in Jingu Gaien there are lots of trees that have been living for 100 years,"" she said. ""They will cut the old trees in order to build skyscrapers or rebuild this baseball stadium.""

The plan to move the baseball to a new location would put the facility against the ginkgo trees, which environmentalists claim will damage the complex root system and potentially kill or damage trees.

MLB PITCHER GETS FIRST CAREER WIN THANKS TO ODD SCORING QUIRK

A poll last year showed about 69.5% were against the project, which could take 13 years to complete.

Rochelle Kopp, who runs a Tokyo management consulting company and is a leader of the protest movement, said an injunction to stop the preliminary work could be filed in the next few weeks.

Activists believe Koike has the power to cancel the project but has, instead, given developers the go-ahead to start the project.

Koike has said the number of trees in the area would increase from 1,904 to 1,998 through the redevelopment and that ""green area"" coverage could increase from 25% to 30%.

Kopp argued that not all trees are created equal.

""However, not all trees are equal. Huge 100-year-old trees provide significantly more CO2 sequestering and cooling effect than small new saplings,"" Kopp said.

Meiji Jingu Stadium is an artifact in baseball lore and one of four ballparks still standing where Ruth has hit a home run. Fenway Park, Wrigley Field and Koshien Stadium in Kobe, Japan, are the others.

'Princess Bride' star Cary Elwes shares thoughts on possibility of reboot,"Cary Elwes, star of the beloved 1987 cult fantasy film ""The Princess Bride,"" doesn’t think there’s a shot at it ever being remade

Elwes told ""E! News"" in a recent interview, ""There's no reboot.""

He continued, ""There was a studio head one time who suggested that, and he posted it on Twitter, and I responded, 'There's a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one.'""

The 60-year-old actor had responded to a 2019 tweet from Variety in which Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra had told the outlet, ""Very famous people whose names I won't use, but they want to redo ‘The Princess Bride.’""

'THE PRINCESS BRIDE' CAST: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

Elwes paraphrased one of his more famous quotes from the movie in his response, and he said that it ""got quite a sizeable response of positive feedback"" at the time.

He added a definitive opinion: ""I don't think you can touch it.""

""The Princess Bride,"" based on the 1973 novel of the same name, premiered in 1987 and celebrated its 35th anniversary last year. It wasn’t a box-office hit when it first played in theaters, but over the decades it has become a family favorite for many people, with its quotable lines and memorable moments.

The closest the film has come to being remade was in 2020 during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, when dozens of celebrities recreated the movie shot for shot and line for line at home with improvised costumes and props. Elwes even appeared, but instead recreating his role as the hero Westley, he played the evil Prince Humperdinck.

The charming recreations were broadcast on the now-defunct Quibi.

Elwes also told ""E! News"" that the cast remains close.

""We do get together, and we do celebrate each other,"" he told the outlet. ""We're all one big family now thanks to this wonderful film.""

The actor noted that there aren’t any plans at the moment for the cast to reunite on screen.

Zion Williamson dunks in warmups despite not being ready to play in critical game,"The New Orleans Pelicans’ season is over, and controversy over one of the team’s most polarizing players has begun.

Zion Williamson was not available for a must-win matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA play-in tournament. But he didn't look like he was injured in his pregame workout.

Williamson threw down a windmill dunk during his workout before the game, and it got many people questioning whether he’s actually hurt.

Williamson was also making hard, explosive moves on the court and was hitting shots with a trainer defending him. So, it didn’t appear his right hamstring, which he injured in January, was bothering him much.

He also said it wasn’t on Tuesday.

PELICANS STAR ZION WILLIAMSON OPENS UP ABOUT HIS STRUGGLES WITH INJURIES: ‘IT’S BEEN FRUSTRATING'

""Physically, I’m fine,"" Williamson said, via The Associated Press. ""Now, it’s a matter of when I fee like Zion.""

What exactly is feeling like Zion?

""I can pretty much do everything, but it’s just a matter of the level that I was playing at before my hamstring,"" Williamson said. ""I don’t want to go out there and be in my own head and affect the team when I can just be on the sideline supporting them more because I know myself. If I was to go out there, I would be in my head. I would hesitate on certain moves, and it could affect the game.""

Williamson has not played for the Pelicans since Jan. 4 after aggravating his hamstring. He also reaggravated the injury in February, which set him back.

Meanwhile, veteran guard CJ McCollum revealed he has been playing through a thumb injury, one that requires offseason surgery. A shoulder injury also may need surgery, but he played through it Wednesday night.

"Hundreds of US drugmakers, including Pfizer, call for reversal of sales suspension of abortion pill","Over 300 biotech and pharmaceutical industry executives, including Pfizer Inc CEO Albert Bourla, signed an open letter on Monday calling for reversal of a federal judge's decision to suspend sales of the abortion pill mifepristone.

A U. S. judge on Friday suspended the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's two-decade-old approval of the drug, effectively banning sales while a case brought by anti-abortion groups before him continues in the Northern District of Texas.

Last week's ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk undermines the FDA's authority, the letter's authors wrote, adding that it ignores decades of scientific evidence and legal precedent.

""We call for the reversal of this decision to disregard science, and the appropriate restitution of the mandate for the safety and efficacy of medicines for all with the FDA, the agency entrusted to do so in the first place,"" they wrote.

Bourla was the first leader of a major pharmaceutical company to add his name to the letter, which also bore the signatures of more than 300 executives from smaller U. S. biotechnology companies.

The letter was written by ReCode Therapeutics CEO Shehnaaz Suliman, Blackfynn co-founder Amanda Banks, and Ovid Therapeutics CEO Jeremy Levin, who is also a former chairman of biotech industry lobbying group BIO.

The decision puts the entire industry at risk, the letter says, and sets a precedent for undermining the agency's authority to approve drugs, adding regulatory uncertainty that they warned would disincentivize investment in new treatments.

""You have the real potential of having medicines not being developed because it's far too expensive, or medicines that are currently approved being withdrawn because they are political,"" Levin told Reuters.

The FDA approved mifepristone, part of a two-drug regimen that accounts for more than half of U. S. abortions, more than 20 years ago and has determined its safety several times since.

Health policy and legal experts have said that if Kacsmaryk's unprecedented ruling is allowed to stand it could undermine confidence in FDA's authority to regulate drugs, severely weaken the agency, and hinder access to new treatments.

""If courts can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone,"" the letter said.

The ruling could open the possibility to the banning of vaccines and contraception for women, said Levin.

""This is a nightmare scenario for the industry,"" he said. ""It's the single worst threat to the industry in over 50 years.""",2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z

Wiggins was away from the team since Feb. 14 and didn’t have a timeline for a return as he dealt with a personal matter.

He returned April 4 to Golden State, but he didn’t participate in the final three regular-season games while he got himself in game shape. During his absence, Wiggins was still working out, Kerr noted in the past.

The Warriors secured the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference, earning them a place in the first round of the NBA Playoffs instead of needing the NBA play-in tournament to qualify.

The Kings were a surprise team this year, but the Warriors, despite winning it all last year, won’t be questioning the No. 3 seed’s ability to beat them.

Wiggins averaged 17.1 points, five rebounds and 2.3 assists over 37 games this season.

It will be a new situation for Wiggins with the Warriors, though. He's never come off the bench for a game he’s played for Golden State. Since he was traded to the Warriors from the Minnesota Timberwolves, he’s started all 193 games he’s played.

In fact, Wiggins has started every game he’s ever played in the NBA since being drafted first overall by the Wolves in 2014. He’s averaged 19.1 points in 635 regular-season games.

Grizzlies' Ja Morant files countersuit against teen he got into physical altercation with,"Ja Morant has reportedly filed a countersuit against a teenager who claims the Memphis Grizzlies superstar showed off a weapon after a physical altercation between the two last summer.

Morant and the boy fought one another during a pickup basketball game at Morant's residence after sharing hard passes to one another to check the ball in. The boy's return pass slipped out of his hands and hit Morant in the face.

The star guard is claiming the pass could have ended his career.

When the ball struck Morant, he put his chin on the boy's shoulder and asked a friend, ""Do I do it to him?"" When the friend replied yes, Morant appeared to punch the boy in the jaw. Morant allegedly punched the boy ""12 or 13 times,"" and his friends added ""four or five"" more strikes.

After the fight, the boy, according to Morant, said he was ""going to come back and light this place up like fireworks."" Morant then filed a police report about the boy's comment, citing threats made to his family. That's when Morant came back outside with a gun, according to the teen, but Morant says that is a claim that is untrue.

The teen ""lied to the police about Morant brandishing a weapon and that the key details of the once-sealed case were leaked to the media in violation of a court order,"" the countersuit says.

The legendary Grammy winner has been preparing to kick off his latest tour, starting with a special appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. Sheryl Crow, Kacey Musgraves, Miranda Lambert, Chris Stapleton, Snoop Dogg and more popular artists are scheduled to perform with Nelson during the two-day event.

""Working is really good for me, no matter what kind of show it is,"" Nelson told AARP.

""The fact that I’ll be there for two days with a lot of my good friends coming out…saying hello and singing with me makes it a lot of fun. I’m looking forward to it.""

Nelson has a fifth-degree black belt in GongKwon Yusul, but said he doesn't necessarily rely on those martial arts skills to defend himself.

""Mainly it gives you enough confidence where you don’t have to jump out there and get into trouble. If they bring it to you, you feel confident you can handle it. It’s not anything I worry about, because I’m not really afraid of it. I don’t really think I’m afraid of anything,"" he said.

Nelson also confessed that marijuana has improved his life over the years, saying there are upsides to the drug.

""I don’t smoke as much as I used to. Every now and then, I’ll take a hit. I’ll still do a couple edibles. It has a positive effect with me. I’m one of those redheaded kids with a high temper. I feel like it calms me down a little bit,"" he explained.

Birth rate in Italy hits record low in 2022 as population continues to shrink,"Births in Italy dropped to a new historic low below 400,000 in 2022, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Friday, as the population continued to shrink.

Italy's death of babies is considered a national emergency, and fixing the problem was a prominent policy pledge by Giorgia Meloni ahead of last year's election which saw her become the country's first woman prime minister.

Last year Italy recorded more than 12 deaths for every seven births and the resident population fell by 179,000 to 58.85 million, ISTAT said in its annual demographic report.

FORMER ITALIAN PREMIER SILVIO BERLUSCONI SAYS HE'LL 'ONCE AGAIN' RECOVER FOLLOWING LEUKEMIA DIAGNOSIS

The population decline slowed somewhat compared with 2021 and 2020, two years heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Italy recorded 392,600 births in 2022, down from 400,249 the previous year, ISTAT said, the 14th consecutive fall and the lowest number since the country's unification in 1861.

""A major factor is the reduction and the ageing of the female population in the 15-49 age group conventionally considered reproductive,"" the institute said in a note.

POPE FRANCIS WON'T PRESIDE OVER GOOD FRIDAY'S LATE-NIGHT WAY OF THE CROSS EVENT DUE TO COLD WEATHER IN ROME

The fertility rate edged down to 1.24 children per woman from 1.25 in 2021, registering a decline in central and northern regions and a marginal increase in the south.

The trend was partly offset by immigration, with immigrants exceeding emigrants by 229,000 last year compared with a net inflow of 160,000 in 2021. Foreigners made up 8.6% of the country's population in 2022, for a total of 5.05 million.

Italy's overall population has been falling steadily since 2014, with a cumulative loss since then of more than 1.36 million people, equivalent to the residents of Milan, the country's second biggest city.

ISTAT predicted in September that Italy could lose almost a fifth of its residents, with the population set to decline, under a baseline scenario, to 54.2 million in 2050 and 47.7 million in 2070.

In its latest report, ISTAT said one in four people in Italy is above the age of 65, while the number of centenarians has tripled to 22,000 over the last 20 years.

Life expectancy at birth stood at 82.6 in 2022, with people in wealthy central and northern regions living longer than those in poorer southern ones.

Overall, men born in Italy can expect to live to 80 years and six months, and women until almost 85.",2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z
Blackhawks to part ways with captain Jonathan Toews; regular-season finale to serve as send-off,"Jonathan Toews and the Chicago Blackhawks will soon go their separate ways.

The team revealed its decision to not re-sign the team captain, making Thursday night's regular-season finale Toews' Chicago send-off.

After missing time due to chronic immune response syndrome and long COVID, the 34-year-old rejoined the team in early April.

Thursday will mark the end of Toews' 15th season in the league. He has not publicly mentioned retiring.

""I've had a number of conversations with Jonathan throughout the season about his future with the Blackhawks, and recently, we had the difficult conversation that we won't be re-signing him this offseason,"" Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said in a statement.

""Tonight will be his final game as a Blackhawk, and it was very important to us to be able to provide the proper send-off for Jonathan and our fans.""

The Blackhawks will welcome the Philadelphia Flyers to the United Center Thursday night. Chicago defeated Philly in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals with Toews receiving playoff MVP honors.

Toews entered the 2022-23 season on the final year of his eight-year, $84 million contract. In the 53 games he has played this season, he has recorded 14 goals and 16 assists.

Following a series of conversations, Davidson said he told Toews of the decision while the team was in Seattle last week. The GM also said he had talked to CEO Danny Wirtz, the son of Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz, about the move.

""Danny and Rocky spoke with Jonathan, not about this, just to kind of reminisce about what was lived and experienced and just to show that respect and share in the memories that were made together,"" Davidson said. ""So, when you're moving on from someone like Jonathan Toews, they have to be involved. They have to be, given the status and stature of the player.""

The Blackhawks selected Toews with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2006 NHL Draft. He became the team captain when he was just 20 years old in July 2008

Toews became a pivotal part of the 2010, 2013 and 2015 Stanley Cup championship teams. In 1,066 regular-season games, Toews has 371 goals and 511 assists. In 139 career playoff games, he has posted 45 goals and 74 assists.

""He has done so much for this organization, and no matter where he plays next, we're excited our fans get the chance to show Jonathan exactly how much he means to them,"" Davidson said in his statement.

Last month, Toews prioritized his long-term health and ability to lead a ""normal life."" He also mentioned that he wants to close out his tenure in Chicago on a high note.

""It's definitely on my mind that this could be my last few weeks here as a Blackhawk in Chicago,"" Toews said last month. ""It's definitely very important for me to go out there and enjoy the game and just kind of soak it in and just really appreciate everything I've been able to be part of here in Chicago.""

Avalanche captain Gabriel Landeskog will miss Stanley Cup playoffs in team's quest to repeat,"The defending Stanley Cup Champions will continue their season-long uphill battle in their quest to repeat.

The Colorado Avalanche announced Thursday that captain Gabriel Landeskog will not play in the playoffs due to a knee injury that has kept him out all season long.

Mötley Crüe manager says Mick Mars is a victim of 'elder abuse' amid touring dispute,"Mötley Crüe's manager claimed Mick Mars' representatives are ""taking advantage"" of the guitarist amid the group's recent touring dispute.

In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Mick Mars accused the band of forcing him to resign after he chose to stop touring. However, the band's manager Allen Kovac and a lawyer for the band claimed representatives for Mars, including the guitarist's lawyer, ""manipulated"" him into the dispute.

Kovac, who has managed the heavy metal band for the past 29 years, told Fox News Digital, ""Every time there was a problem, [Mick] would call me. I haven't heard from Mick. I would have protected him from the elderly abuse that [the representatives] are taking advantage of him with.""

A representative for Mars had no comment regarding the ""elder abuse"" allegation.

Mars filed a mandate of writ on April 6 claiming Mötley Crüe had been slow to turn over documents, but Mötley Crüe's lawyer Sasha Frid of Miller Barondess told Fox News Digital there is ""no issue"" regarding documents.

""We're an open book. We're not hiding any documents from this guy,"" Frid claimed. ""There's no issue with documents. You want your documents, here are your documents.""

The mandate of writ was filed ahead of the band and Mars going to arbitration over a shareholders agreement amendment signed in 2008. At the time, all original members of the band – Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Nikki Six and Mick Mars – signed an agreement stating they would not be entitled to any touring revenue or any value of the Mötley Crüe name once they had resigned from the band, according to Frid.

""It's common sense,"" Frid explained. ""If you're not out on the road touring, you don't get any money from touring. Just like when I don't go to work, I don't get a paycheck.""

Mötley Crüe previously claimed that when Mars announced that he couldn't tour anymore, he was resigning from the band. However, in court documents Mars alleges that he told the band members that he could still play in a residency situation and could still record.

The guitarist just could no longer ""physically handle the rigor of the roads.""

""It is beyond sad that, after 41 years together, a band would try to throw out a member who is unable to tour anymore because he has a debilitating disease,"" Mars' attorney Ed McPherson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Mick has been pushed around for far too long in this band, and we are not going to let that continue.""

Meanwhile, lawyers for Mötley Crüe maintain that Mars gave up his rights to any future earnings from tours after he quit.

The back-and-forth between Mars and Mötley Crüe began in October. Fans became confused due to differing statements. Mars announced that he was retiring from touring due to his arthritis, while the band claimed that he was retiring from music completely.

""Things get twisted around sometimes from other band members. I don’t really know if I should say this, but… those guys have been hammering on me since ’87, trying to replace me,"" Mars told Variety. ""They haven’t been able to do that, because I’m the guitar player. I helped form this band. It’s my name I came up with [the Mötley Crüe moniker], my ideas, my money that I had from a backer to start this band. It wouldn’t have gone anywhere.""

Frid and Kovac claim that after Mars announced he was retiring from touring, the guitarist was offered a ""generous compensation package"" despite being entitled to nothing due to the 2008 amendment.

""Despite the fact that the band did not owe Mick anything – and with Mick owing the band millions in advances that he did not pay back – the band offered Mick a generous compensation package to honor his career with the band,"" Frid explained to Fox News Digital. ""Manipulated by his manager and lawyer, Mick refused and chose to file this ugly public lawsuit.""

The ""generous compensation package"" included 7.5% of the remaining tour revenue, according to Kovac. However, Mars and McPherson claimed the musician was entitled to 25% of all touring for the history of the band in perpetuity.

Frid claimed there was no reason to file the writ of mandate, and says the documents requested by Mars could have been recovered through arbitration.

""If this lawsuit was really about documents, then Mick and his lawyer would not have spilled ink recanting a 41-year band history and badmouthing the band’s performance on tours,"" the lawyer said.

""Mick and his lawyer filed this lawsuit to make derogatory statements so that they can be protected from a defamation lawsuit under California’s litigation privilege,"" he claimed. ""This lawsuit is nothing more than a malicious attempt to smear the band and Mick’s former bandmates to gain leverage – orchestrated by Mick’s lawyer.""

In Mars' lawsuit, he also claimed other members of the band were not actually playing while on stage. Specifically, he claimed Nikki Six's parts were all pre-recorded and some of Neil and Lee's were as well.

However, the band obtained signed declarations from crew members, who Kovac claimed are ""independent contractors,"" on Feb. 9 stating that Mars was actually the band member not playing live. Mötley Crüe chose not to publicize these declarations until Mars' lawsuit.

Mars' lawyer claimed the declarations came from ""employees"" of the band.

Few heavy metal acts were as notorious in the 1980s – onstage and off – as Mötley Crüe, whose songs include ""Looks That Kill,"" ""Shout at the Devil"" and ""Girls, Girls, Girls."" Fueled by drugs and booze, their stage show included excessive amounts of pyrotechnics and chain-sawing the head off a mannequin filled with blood.

Mötley Crüe was formed in 1981 by Sixx and Tommy Lee. The two were later joined by Mars and Vince Neil.

This caused Justin to jokingly faint behind the game show podium as luck didn't appear to be on his side.

Rory McIlroy’s decision to withdraw from RBC Heritage could cost millions,"Rory McIlroy’s decision to withdraw from the RBC Heritage this week is proving to be a costly one for the PGA Tour star.

After failing to make the cut at Augusta National last week, McIlroy announced he would be withdrawing from Hilton Head, a move typically expected from the Masters winner.

McIlroy did not offer an explanation, but he stands to lose $3 million as a result.

According to Sports Illustrated and Golf Channel, RBC Heritage marks the second tournament of the PGA Tour’s 17 designated events that members are required to play to cash in on the Player Impact Program (PIP).

McIlroy previously skipped out on the Sentry Tournament of Champions at Kapalua, another designated event, at the start of the year. Under the current rules, players are only allowed one opt-out.

According to The Associated Press, the Tour originally said 25% of the bonus would be paid after Kapalua. A memo sent to players in December said 75% would be paid after Kapalua, and the rest paid when a player met the rest of his obligations, which included playing in 16 of 17 designated events.

McIlroy was No. 2 behind Tiger Woods when the PIP results were announced in November.

A source told Sports Illustrated McIlroy will now forfeit $3 million of his $12 million earnings because of his withdrawal from RBC Heritage.

"Mary Quant, designer who revolutionized 1960s fashion, dies at age 93","Mary Quant, the visionary fashion designer whose colorful, sexy miniskirts epitomized Swinging London in the 1960s and influenced youth culture around the world, has died. She was 93.

Quant’s family said she died ""peacefully at home"" in Surrey, southern England, on Thursday.

Quant helped popularize the miniskirt — some credit her with inventing it — and the innovative tights that went along with it, creating dresses and accessories that were an integral part of the look. She created mix-and-match, simple garments that had an element of whimsy. Some compared her impact on the fashion world with The Beatles’ impact on pop music.

""I think it was a happy confluence of events, which is really what fashion is so often all about,"" said Hamish Bowles, international editor at large for American Vogue magazine. ""She was the right person with the right sensibility in the right place at the right time. She appeared on the scene at the exact cusp of the ’60s.""

GILBERT GOTTFRIED: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE LATE ‘ALADDIN’ STAR AND COMEDIAN

He said Quant was also an astute businesswoman and one of the first to understand how branding herself as a creative force could help her sustain her business and branch out into new fields, like cosmetics.

Alexandra Shulman, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, wrote on Twitter: ""RIP Dame Mary Quant. A leader of fashion but also in female entrepreneurship- a visionary who was much more than a great haircut.""

Quant was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the ""youthquake"" that took hold in the 1960s. She sensed that the days of the exclusive salons were numbered, and thought that even the great Parisian designers would follow ready-to-wear trends.

The look she created was sexy and fun, a sharp break with the predictable floral day dresses commonly worn in the conservative, austere years after World War II.

Quant introduced miniskirts with hemlines up to 8 inches above the knee to the London scene in 1966 and they were an instant hit with young people, in part because they shocked and offended many.

While some insist she first developed the style, many also credit French designer Andre Courreges, whose 1964 spring collection included minidresses that were popular in Paris but did not have widespread impact outside France. Others cite the short skirts worn by actress Anne Francis in the 1956 film ""Forbidden Planet"" as the first example of the miniskirt.

Whether or not she was the first to design them, it was Quant who figured out how to market the miniskirt to the masses.

Quant, who named the skirt after her favorite make of car, the Mini, recalled how it offered a ""feeling of freedom and liberation.″ From her shop on King’s Road in London's trendy Chelsea neighborhood, she took part in a clothing revolution.

""It was the girls on King’s Road who invented the mini. I was making clothes which would let you run and dance and we would make them the length the customer wanted,″ she said. ""I wore them very short and the customers would say, ‘shorter, shorter’.""

While Courreges came from an haute couture tradition and his clothes were expensive items aimed at a limited audience, Quant used a variety of materials and colors to make miniskirts popular with young women on a limited budget.

""She blasted through barriers of snobbery and tradition, with her vision of fashion as a way of resisting stereotypes, with well-made clothes and cosmetics that were empowering and liberating, as well as affordable,"" said Jenny Lister, who curated a 2020 exhibition devoted to Quant at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum.

""Fashion today owes so much to the revolutionary, trailblazing Mary Quant.""""

She shot to the top of the fashion scene at the time when The Beatles and Rolling Stones dominated the music world, and she was forever linked to the heady freedoms of the 1960s.

The clothes became wildly popular and were worn by models like Twiggy and Pattie Boyd, who was then married to Beatles guitarist George Harrison.

Asked by the Guardian newspaper in 1967 if her clothes could be considered ""vulgar"" because they were so revealing, Quant replied that she loved vulgarity and embraced it.

""Good taste is death, vulgarity is life,"" she said, adding that the provocative poses of her models reflected the new sexual openness of the times, which was fueled by the development of the birth control pill.

Born Feb. 11, 1930, the daughter of schoolteachers, Quant studied art education at Goldsmith’s College in London before moving into fashion, working first as an apprentice to a hat-maker before trying her own designs.

With the help of her wealthy husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene, and the accountant Archie McNair, she opened Bazaar in Chelsea in 1955, at first relying on innovative window displays to bring in younger customers.

""Snobbery has gone out of fashion, and in our shops you will find duchesses jostling with typists to buy the same dress,"" Quant once said. She called the store ""a sophisticated candy store for grown-ups.""

Bazaar became a focal point for the young and the beautiful and those who wanted to rub shoulders with them, and her presence there helped make the neighborhood a favored destination. Small restaurants, bistros and pubs all flourished and other boutiques opened, giving Chelsea’s King’s Road the feel of a perpetual party.

The shop was such a success that she soon moved into other parts of London and began exporting her clothes to the United States, where the ""British invasion"" was in full swing.

Quant was unusual in that she often modeled her own clothes, usually with her hair styled in a distinctive, angular bob by hairdresser Vidal Sassoon.

She soon diversified her interests, developing a popular makeup line and also moving into kitchenware and household accessories.

The makeup proved extremely profitable, particularly in Japan, where Quant retained a devoted following.

Quant was also credited with introducing hot pants and micro-minis to the fashion scene in the late 1960s.

She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for service to the fashion industry in 1966, wearing a trademark miniskirt when she received the honor at Buckingham Palace. In 2014, she was made a dame — the female equivalent of a knight — for services to British fashion. At the start of this year she was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honor, a royal honor restricted to 65 people ""of distinction"" in the arts, science, medicine or government

Quant stepped down from the day-to-day management of her firm, Mary Quant Ltd., in 2000 after it was purchased by a Japanese company, but kept working as a consultant.

The firm continued to use the daisy motif and logo that Quant pioneered in the 1960s, and it long maintained a shop in London, in addition to roughly 200 shops in Japan.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Israel Adesanya gives iconic celebration after knocking out Alex Pereira to win back UFC belt,"Israel Adesanya tasted victory once again in UFC after knocking out Alex Pereira to win back the middleweight belt in Miami on Saturday night.

As the ""Last Stylebender"" has done many times in the past, he delivered an iconic celebration after delivering the final blows at UFC 287.

Pereira, who defeated Adesanya in November to strip him of the 185-pound belt, used a right knee to the face that backed his opponent into the cage. But he wasn’t prepared for Adesanya’s two quick right hooks that had him stumble down to the canvas.

A right hammer fist from Adesanya saw the referee quickly get in between the fighters, and that was it: Adesanya was champion once more.

As the referee checked to make sure Pereira was OK, Adesanya stepped back and pulled invisible arrows from his back and ""shot them"" at Pereira before letting out a scream in celebration.

Adesanya moved to a career 24-2 in UFC, while Pereira is now 7-2. Adesanya has been in this position before, but never against Pereira, who beat him in kickboxing twice prior to the November win that earned him the title.

With this victory, Adesanya’s happiness was on clear display.

""A win for the ages!"" broadcaster Jim Nantz enthused, as the gallery erupted when Woods' final putt dropped in the 18th hole.

His 12-shot victory over second-place finisher Tom Kite remains the greatest margin in the history of the storied golf tournament.

He is still the youngest winner in Masters history.

Woods shot an incredible 18-under, which stood as the lowest-ever score in the Masters until it was surpassed by Dustin Johnson in 2020 (-20).

Golf Digest called the win by the 21-year-old phenom ""the dawn of dominance"" and an ""epic victory that shook the game.""

Woods tore up all four rounds, including a scintillating 65 (7-under) third round on Saturday that put him in a commanding position entering the final found.

Woods, who turned pro only seven months earlier, laid waste to a field of the greatest golfers in the game.

""There’s a new era about to dawn at the most magical setting in golf,"" CBS announced as it opened its final-round broadcast.

Woods was famously given a golf club the moment he could walk by his father Earl Woods, a U. S. Army Green Beret officer who served in Vietnam.

Tiger proved a natural. He shocked a national TV audience by driving golf balls at age 2 in front of Bob Hope on ""The Mike Douglas Show.""

He dominated amateur golf as a teenager, winning a record three consecutive U. S. Junior Championships (1991-93), then adding an NCAA golf title (1996) while playing for Stanford, among many other honors.

Woods turned pro in September 1996 and won two PGA Tour events before year-end. Sports Illustrated named him its ""Sportsman of the Year"" for 1996 and again in 2000.

His innate ability, coupled with the demands of a driven father and his own quest for excellence, gave Tiger's ascendancy as a professional an air of inevitability witnessed by millions in the final round of the 1997 Masters.

Woods, with an insurmountable lead, was followed across the final several holes by an electrified gallery entranced by the greatness unfolding in front of their eyes.

Drake Bell is 'safe' after former Nickelodeon star was reported ‘missing and endangered’,"Former Nickelodeon actor Drake Bell, is no longer missing, the Daytona Beach Police department has confirmed.

The actor, 36, was previously labeled as ""missing and endangered"" by police.

""At this time we can confirm law enforcement officials are in contact and Mr. Bell is safe,"" a police spokesperson told Fox 35 News.

In a missing person's post on its official Facebook page, the Daytona Beach Police Department reported earlier this morning that Bell, whose real name is Jared, was last seen driving his 2022 gray BMW in the area of Mainland High School before 9 p.m. Wednesday.

A representative for Bell's attorney told Fox News Digital at the time he has ""no comment at this time.""

Included in the post was a photograph of Bell wearing black framed glasses and a baseball cap.

The department left an additional comment on the post saying, ""For those asking, this is a legitimate post from the Daytona Beach Police Department.""

Bell has faced a litany of run-ins with the law, including an arrest for driving under the influence in 2016, and most recently pleading guilty to two charges involving a minor in Ohio in 2021. The child star was charged with one count of felony attempted child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles.

Bell was sentenced to two years' probation, as well as 200 hours of community service in California. Additionally, he cannot have any communication with the victim.

After probation, the judge said Bell's sex offender status would be reviewed.

Fox 8 reported Bell allegedly engaged in an inappropriate chat with a victim that ""at times, was sexual in nature.""

After pleading guilty, Bell acknowledged the ""mistakes"" he had made in an Instagram video, but claimed some of the rumors about him were not true.

""A lot of the news that you've been hearing, most of the news that you've heard recently, is entirely false and wrong, and I feel that you deserve and I owe you an explanation,"" he said.

Bell alleges it was ""reckless and irresponsible text messages"" exchanged with a fan for which he took a plea deal.

In 2020, Bell was accused of verbal and physical abuse by his ex-girlfriend, Melissa Lingafelt.

In a since-deleted TikTok video, Lingafelt alleged that the abuse began when she moved in with the actor at 16. They were in a relationship from August 2006 to February 2009.

""First off I'd like to start out by saying, I don't really care if anyone believes me, as this is my story and my life, and something that I went through. It wasn't until recently that I actually realized that abuse isn't something that all women have to go through.… I moved in with him, I was singing. It wasn't until about a year when the verbal abuse started,"" she said.

Lingafelt described the verbal abuse as ""the worst"" someone could ""ever imagine.""

Bell said via a representative to Variety, ""I never abused my ex-girlfriend or did so many of the other things Melissa falsely claimed on her TikTok video. As our relationship ended – more than a decade ago – we, unfortunately, both called each other terrible names, as often happens when couples are breaking up. But that is it. Clearly, Melissa still felt close enough to me just last year that she was comfortable reaching out to ask me to provide her with financial support during a tough time (which I did). I do not know if today’s behavior is some kind of misguided quest for more money or attention. But I cannot and will not allow these offensive and defamatory allegations to go unchallenged and I am reviewing my legal options.""

""My kids call him Uncle Woody. His kids call me Uncle Matthew… you see pictures of us and my family thinks a lot of pictures of him are me. His family thinks a lot of pictures of me are him.""

The 53-year-old actor continued to share that during a family vacation, his mother brought up a special connection she may have had with Harrelson’s father.

""In Greece a few years ago, we’re sitting around talking about how close we are and our families,"" McConaughey noted.

""My mom is there, and she says, ‘Woody, I knew your dad.’ Everyone was aware of the ellipses that my mom left after ‘knew.’ It was a loaded K-N-E-W.""

The father of three shared that Harrelson’s father may have linked up with his mother during McConaughey’s parent’s divorce.

Journalist shames LIV golfers despite connections to schools that take in Saudi funds,"Editor's note: A previous version of this story read that Christine Brennan is an active member of the University of Toledo Board of Trustees. She left her position with the school in 2021. The current version further clarifies her role on the board.

LIV golfers have been no strangers to backlash, and it heightened this past weekend during the Masters.

Dozens of golfers defected from the PGA Tour to LIV, a golf league that is backed monetarily by the Saudis.

LIV's participants are guaranteed money in their contracts – some of which reportedly go well into nine-figures. On the contrary, PGA Tour members make their living on the course based on where they finish at each tournament.

Those in LIV are banned from playing in PGA Tour-sanctioned events, but majors, including the Masters, are their own entities. And because sports have their own way of destiny, after months of verbal, and legal, back-and-forth, it was PGA vs. LIV on golf's biggest stage, as Jon Rahm and LIV's Brooks Koepka were the final pairing on Sunday.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS. COM

Koepka went to LIV last year, admittedly a decision that was influenced by his lack of health and question marks around whether he could return to form. Koepka let a green jacket slip to first-time winner Rahm with a 75 in the final round.

Longtime journalist Christine Brennan, quite literally, thanked Rahm for winning the Masters.

""Here’s a message from the leaders of men’s golf, especially Augusta National Golf Club, for Spain’s Jon Rahm; Thank you. Thank you for winning the Masters so LIV Golf didn’t,"" she wrote for Golfweek.

""That man won the Masters Sunday. And because he won, LIV lost,"" she continued, saying Rahm saved the sport from ""utter embarrassment.""

""That’s the story. That’s the headline. At the end of the day, that’s really all that matters.""

Brennan was quick to criticize the golfers for taking the Saudi money.

TIGER WOODS' CHILLING REASON FOR BOWING OUT OF 2022 PGA CHAMPIONSHIP REVEALED BY JASON DAY

""Let us make no mistake what Koepka, [Phil] Mickelson, [Patrick] Reed and the other 15 LIV golfers who arrived here have done. They left their regular tour jobs to go into the ‘sportswashing’ business with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the mastermind of the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, as well as his golf-bro buddies in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the nation responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States and abysmal human rights violations against women and the LGBTQ community.""

But there's a wrinkle here – Brennan was a non-voting national trustee on the University of Toledo Board of Trustees from 2017 to 2021. The school brought in more than $13 million worth of Saudi funding between February 2020 and June 2022.

Brennan was a member of the Academic and Student Affairs Committee, as well as the Trusteeship and Governance Committee.

She also is listed as a current member of the board of trustees at the University of Northwestern as well as currently a professor of practice at Northwestern's journalism school. Northwestern received over $1 million from Saudi Arabia from 2019 to 2022.

Both her current and former positions at Northwestern and Toledo are in a voluntary capacity and unpaid.

Athletes from Russia and Belarus have been able to participate in WTA and ATP events as neutral athletes. Wimbledon announced in 2022 that these athletes would be banned from competition, a measure that was reversed this year.

But Swiatek told the BBC Wednesday she felt tennis should have been more aggressive in taking a stand against Russian aggression.

WIMBLEDON REVERSES STANCE ON RUSSIAN AND BELARUSIAN ATHLETES, LIFTS BAN FOR 2023 TOURNAMENT

""After World War II, German players were not allowed, as well as Japanese and Italian (players). And I feel like this kind of thing would show the Russian government that maybe it's not worth it,"" the Polish tennis pro told the British outlet.

""I know it's a small thing because we are just athletes, a little piece in the world, but I feel like sport is pretty important and sport has always been used in propaganda.""

Several international sports governing bodies are continuing to take a hard line against athletes' participation from Russia and Belarus.

An Olympic qualifying event for women’s fencing in Poland was canceled this week after the International Fencing Federation voted last month to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to resume competition.

But banning those athletes from tennis now would be ""unfair,"" Swiatek said.

""Tennis didn't really go that way, but now it would be pretty unfair for Russian and Belarusian players to do that because this decision was supposed to be made a year ago.""

Swiatek did express empathy for those athletes against the war, acknowledging the complexities of them having to speak out against it.

""It's not their fault they have a passport like that, but, on the other hand, we all have some kind of impact. And I feel like anything that would help stop the Russian aggression, we should go that way in terms of the decisions the federations are making.

""I really respect [speaking out against the war] because I feel it's brave for Russian athletes to say that because their situation is pretty complicated, and sometimes it's hard for them to speak out loud about it.""",2023-04-06T00:00:00.000Z
Masters champ Jon Rahm reveals heartwarming reason he’s still competing in RBC Heritage after ‘demanding week’,"Jon Rahm is taking no downtime after his victory at the Masters, despite how tempting it may be.

The newly ranked World No. 1 told reporters Wednesday that he was exhausted following a ""demanding week"" at Augusta National. Yet, he’s not withdrawing from the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, South Carolina, this week and with good reason.

""It did cross my mind,"" Rahm said. ""It did cross my mind, but I made a commitment earlier in the year, and I want to honor that commitment.""

'Frasier' star Anthony LaPaglia reveals whether he’ll do reboot,"Frasier Crane is back – and Anthony LaPaglia is listening.

In February 2021, Paramount+ announced that the ‘90s sitcom ""Frasier"" would be revived for the streaming service, with original star Kelsey Grammer reprising his role as Dr. Frasier Crane.

LaPaglia, who had a recurring role as Daphne Moon’s (Jane Leeves) drunken brother Simon, told Fox News Digital he would be open to appearing in the reboot if he were asked. The Australian actor won an Emmy for the series.

""I would do it in a heartbeat,"" the 64-year-old said. ""But I’m pretty sure that I’m not in the architecture of the new [series]. I think the new one will be slightly different. John Mahoney is not there, and I don’t think David Hyde Pierce is in it either. I don’t know what form is taking, but I’m perfectly happy with what I did. It was great fun at the time. And sometimes revisiting things could spoil that memory. I hope it does well. I certainly want to know how it all unfolds.""

Mahoney, who starred as patriarch Martin Crane, passed away in 2018 at age 77. In November 2022, Grammer told People magazine that Hyde Pierce, who played Dr. Niles Crane, bowed out of the reboot.

""David basically decided he wasn’t really interested in repeating the performance of Niles,"" the 68-year-old told the outlet at the time about his on-screen brother, 64. Grammer emphasized that the reboot would focus on ""new friendships"" and would explain the absence of some of the original characters, including Mahoney.

In March 2023, it was announced that Bebe Neuwirth would reprise her role as Lilith in a guest-starring role.

LaPaglia said he runs into his former castmates ""once in a blue moon.""

""I think most actors might say the same thing,"" he explained. ""When you’re working on something, you develop these genuine relationships with people. But then when the project is over, you go off to work on something else. There are some actors that I’m still friends with, even if I speak to them twice a year. But that’s just the nature of the business, the nature of the beast. You find yourself away on location for a good part of the year. So maintaining friendships can be difficult… It’s not a normal life.""

Still, the star said he has fond memories from his time on set. He described having a close bond with ""the great"" Mahoney.

""He had a set of headshots that he would give out to fans, and I would go in there and write some really insulting stuff on his headshots,"" LaPaglia chuckled. ""And then he would find my headshot and write some really insulting stuff on mine! And we’d put them in each other’s dressing rooms. We had a very funny, juvenile relationship, but we used to make each other laugh a lot.""

""I had a really good time with him,"" LaPaglia continued. ""Kelsey was great and the rest of the cast was great, but John Mahoney and I really hit it off… He was just a very funny, generous guy. I didn’t even realize what an accomplished actor he was. In between ‘Frasier,’ he kept busy doing theater. He also had a substantial career even before ‘Frasier.’ And he’s from Manchester in England, which floored me because his accent was perfect. I miss him.""

LaPaglia also described Grammer as ""welcoming on set.""

""My favorite memory? That’s easy,"" he said. ""I remember walking on the set early one morning and I suddenly heard this beautiful piano piece. I don’t remember what piece it was, but it was a classical piece. I just thought, ‘That’s nice, they’re piping that music through the sound stage.’ I walked around and, in the corner, there was a piano with Kelsey playing this beautiful piece. That just blew me away. I had no idea.""

These days, LaPaglia is looking ahead. He’s starring in ""Florida Man"" – no, not the meme. It’s a scripted series premiering on Netflix. It stars Édgar Ramirez, who plays a struggling ex-cop and gambling addict who owes big time to a Philly mobster. He returns home to his home state of Florida, only for his woes to heat up. The show, which LaPaglia described as ""a black comedy,"" also stars Abbey Lee, Clark Gregg and Paul Schneider, among others.

""Édgar is an absolute sweetheart,"" said LaPaglia about the ""American Crime Story"" actor. ""He is probably one of the most considerate, level-headed actors that I’ve worked with – and that’s saying something! He was just very kind and very involved in the scenes. We had a lot of fun off-camera as well. He has a great sense of humor.""

LaPaglia admitted he wasn’t familiar with the ""Florida Man"" phenomenon, or kooky criminals causing havoc in the Sunshine State.

""Listen, here in Australia we have Darwin, which is like the Florida equivalent,"" he chuckled. ""People go there to literally disappear… And I think that can be very attractive to some people. There’s a different set of rules there. Like Florida, it’s a diaspora of all kinds of people. I used to think it was the weather, like in Florida. But now? I’m not so sure.""

Patrick Cantlay addresses Masters' pace of play criticism,"Eight-time PGA Tour winner Patrick Cantlay seemed unbothered by the criticism that followed his pace at the Masters over the weekend, saying Tuesday that he was also held up by the group playing ahead of him and Viktor Hovland.

Brooks Koepka, who finished second at Augusta National on Sunday, seemingly called out Cantlay when he criticized the group ahead of him and eventual winner Jon Rahm.

""Yeah, the group in front of us was brutally slow,"" Koepka lamented. ""Jon went to the bathroom like seven times during the round, and we were still waiting.""

""Yeah, I mean, we finished the first hole, and the group in front of us was on the second tee when we walked up to the second tee, and we waited all day on pretty much every shot,"" he told reporters at a press conference.

""We waited in 15 fairway, we waited in 18 fairway. So, I imagine it was slow for everyone.""

Cantlay, who sits on the Player Advisory Council (PAC), also noted that the course at Augusta National, coupled with the conditions of the day, contributed to a slower round.

""Yeah, one thing that's interesting sitting on the PAC is you get all the numbers and the data, and rounds have taken about the same length of time for the last 10 or 20 years that they currently take. When you play a golf course like Augusta National where all the hole locations are on lots of slope and the greens are really fast, it's just going to take longer and longer to hole out,"" he said.

""So, I think that may have been what attributed to some of the slow play on Sunday, and then also when the wind is gusting and the wind is blowing maybe inconsistently, that's when guys will take a long time, too. I think that's just the nature of playing professional golf, where every shot matters so much.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z

"Wimbledon reverses stance on Russian and Belarusian athletes, lifts ban for 2023 tournament","Russian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed to participate at Wimbledon this year after the All England Club announced Friday that players from those countries will be eligible for competition under certain ""appropriate conditions.""

Organizers released a statement confirming its reversal from last year’s decision that prohibited any player from Russia or Belarus from competing, even as a ""neutral"" athlete.

""The option of personal player declarations was not in our view viable last year,"" the statement read.

""Since then, extensive engagement with the Government and tennis stakeholder bodies has clarified and developed the form of declarations and produced workable measures for their implementation and enforcement. This approach has the full support of the Government and the LTA , ATP, WTA and ITF.""

The statement laid out the specific conditions that players must abide by, including declaring ""neutral"" status. Players will also be prohibited from any ""expressions of support"" for Russia’s invasion, and any player receiving funding from the Russian and/or Belarusian states"" will be barred from entering competition.

That includes ""sponsorship from companies operated or controlled by the states.""

"Marilyn Monroe asked Judy Garland this haunting question, author says","Marilyn Monroe had one important question for Judy Garland.

It was 1962 and the Hollywood stars were at a party. Garland had no idea it would be the last time she would see Monroe. The actress passed away suddenly that same year at age 36 from a barbiturate overdose.

The encounter stayed with the ""Wizard of Oz"" icon over the years before her own brief life came to an end.

""In the literature that exists about Judy Garland, she always told the story that… Marilyn Monroe got her into a corner and asked Judy, ‘Aren’t you afraid? Aren’t you afraid of life?’"" Lawrence Schulman told Fox News Digital. ""And Garland said, ‘Sure, we’re all afraid of life.’ Marilyn Monroe, to some degree, had an even more fragile personality than Judy Garland. They were both fragile personalities, and I think that’s why they liked each other because they felt the same stress and difficulties in life.""

""I think that’s what brought them together,"" Schulman added.

Schulman has translated a new book written by French author Bertrand Tessier titled ""Judy Garland: Splendor and Downfall of a Legend."" It features over 100 rare photos, many published for the first time, including what is believed to be the last known snapshot taken of Garland days before she died in 1969 at age 47. Like Monroe, Garland passed away from a drug overdose.

'50S BLONDE BOMBSHELL CLEO MOORE, THE NEXT MARILYN MONROE, MAY HAVE DIED OF BROKEN HEART, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Schulman pointed out that Garland reflected on her haunting encounter with Monroe in a 1967 article for Ladies Home Journal.

""I knew Marilyn Monroe and loved her dearly,"" Garland told the outlet. ""She asked me for help. Me! I didn’t know what to tell her. One night at a party at Clifton Webb’s house, Marilyn followed me from room to room. ‘I don’t want to get too far away from you,’ she said. ‘I’m scared.’ I told her, ‘We’re all scared. I’m scared too.’ ‘If we could just talk,’ she said, ‘I know you’d understand.’ I said, ‘Maybe I would. If you’re scared, call me and come on over. We’ll talk about it.’""

According to Schulman, the women first met in 1959. And while they weren’t believed to be close friends, they were kindred spirits in a town that both made and broke them.

""They probably met two or three times,"" said Schulman. ""But they felt for each other, that’s for sure.""

When Garland learned of Monroe’s death, she remarked, ""You take pills to sleep, you wake up anyway, but you have forgotten you have taken them. So you take more…""

Garland’s ex-husband Sid Luft later shared in his memoir that Monroe never had the chance to take up Garland’s offer. He described Monroe as ""a quiet presence"" who was ""sweet and very unhappy.""

""She was frustrated and disappointed,"" he recalled.

""That beautiful girl was frightened of aloneness – the same thing I'd been afraid of,"" Garland reflected. ""Like me, she was just trying to do her job – garnish some delightful whipped cream onto some people's lives, but Marilyn and I never got a chance to talk. I had to leave for England and I never saw that sweet, dear girl again. I wish I had been able to talk to her the night she died.""

""I don't think Marilyn really meant to harm herself,"" Garland continued. ""It was partly because she had too many pills available, then was deserted by her friends. You shouldn't be told you're completely irresponsible and be left alone with too much medication. It's too easy to forget.""

But Garland had her own demons to battle. Years of addiction to prescription pills and heavy alcohol abuse ravaged her body and celebrated voice. As a child, she was put on extreme diets to please studio executives who would heavily scrutinize her weight. She worked excruciatingly long hours on set, using stimulants, or ""pep pills,"" to keep her performing when needed. A domineering stage mother ensured those pills were taken. As an adult, Garland was unlucky in love, as she, like Monroe, sought a father figure who would take care of her.

Garland's Los Angeles Times obituary noted that she ""had suffered from hepatitis, exhaustion, kidney ailments, nervous breakdowns, near-fatal drug reactions, overweight, underweight and injuries suffered in falls.""

‘BEVERLY HILLBILLIES’ STAR BUDDY EBSEN LOST 'THE WIZARD OF OZ’ ROLE FOR THIS HORRIFYING REASON, DAUGHTER SAYS

Despite leading a decades-long career as a child star, Garland was plagued with financial mismanagement and embezzlement. According to reports, the mother of three owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes to the IRS. Leading up to her death, she performed sold-out shows, but a majority of her earnings were reportedly seized for back taxes.

""It’s very hard for people to get a grasp that Judy Garland, toward the end of her life, was homeless,"" Schulman explained. ""She was living in hotels, with friends going from place to place, and didn’t have $5 in her pocketbook. So, there is tragedy there. She was around in the 1930s. She was doing films, records and radio – all that stuff – … and she had nothing. What she did have is an addiction to uppers and downers.""

""… She had a house in Los Angeles until 1967, and she couldn’t pay her mortgage,"" Schulman continued. ""She couldn’t pay her taxes. So she had to sell her house to pay her taxes. And from that period on in 1967, she was wandering. She was nowhere. She was sleeping on floors and sleeping… at friends’ places.""

While Garland has long been depicted as a ""walking casualty,"" Schulman said her life wasn’t all tragic. He described how in the months leading up to her death, Garland was also hopeful about what the future held for her.

""When she died, she was living in London,"" Schulman explained. ""… She had rented a small cottage…. It was very small, not a luxurious place at all. But she was comfortable. She didn’t have a lot of money, but she was recently married to her fifth husband, a guy named Mickey Deans. In terms of the very end of her life, she was stable, happy, getting by. She was in a better place. She seemed to be happily married. She was working. She was still a great star and very well-known… I’m not saying there is no tragedy there, but at the very end, I think she found a certain sense of peace.""

'50S STAR ANGIE DICKINSON ON FRANK SINATRA AND WHY SHE NEVER MARRIED 'LOVE OF MY LIFE'

""She wasn’t a tragic person,"" Schulman continued. ""She was a very happy person. If you see photos of her [from] the end of her life, despite that she was in a terrible financial condition, despite that she was in poor health, she was very happy… In Bertrand’s biography, it too shows a side of her which was very joyous… very happy and very pleasant to the very end.""

Schulman pointed out a photograph taken of Garland a few days before her death, which is in the book.

""She died in London, but she was in New York a few days before,"" he explained. ""And she’s all smiles. Her smile is a mile wide. And I wanted that photo to be there to show people that she wasn’t such a tragic figure as they imagined.""

According to Schulman, Garland did make efforts to get clean from drugs. However, her ""addictive personality"" got in her way.

""She never went to a Betty Ford clinic because there were no Betty Ford clinics,"" said Schulman. ""But there were periods where she was relatively clean. When you see her in videos nowadays or on recordings, she’s in good shape. There’s no slurring of her words. She’s not acting strange. She tried several times to reduce her intake of these pills… But in the end, it was a lifelong battle. She was seriously medicated, and that’s what killed her. She struggled to get off the stuff all her life. She never succeeded.""

Today, Schulman hopes Garland will be remembered as a complex human being, one who was hopeful she would reach the end of the rainbow during hardships.

""In the worst of situations, she smiled,"" said Schulman. ""She always had hope despite everything.""",2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z

Dee Snider recalls 'violent' fan encounter,"Dee Snider has showed off his vocal range for decades as the lead singer of Twisted Sister.

His unabashed love for stage performance helped him create his trademark persona to front the band, complete with long, blond curly hair, shredded clothes and theatrical makeup. Millions of fans from around the world have rocked out to Snider at a Twisted Sister show.

Fresh off ""The Masked Singer"" competition, where he took the stage as ""Doll,"" Snider reminisced on a particularly ""strange encounter"" when he was violently confronted by a fan.

""They tend to be violent,"" Snider exclusively told Fox News Digital about fan experiences, recalling when one groupie ""put a straight razor to my throat outside a club.""

""The line between love and hate is very fine,"" Snider said.

""This is back in the bar days, and I was leaving at the end of the show late at night. You know, you have to take your makeup, everybody's gone. It's four in the morning.""

He recalled getting to his car when ""this guy comes and sticks his hand in, and he goes, ‘Hey, Dee, How’s it going?' and puts a straight razor to my throat. He was upset I didn't acknowledge him in some fashion.""

The heavy metal singer said he ""threw the car in reverse"" and then ""pushed the guy's arm to the ceiling"" before speeding away.

""I got out of there, but that was crazy,"" he said. ""That's the thing with fandom … the fine line between love and hate.""

DEE SNIDER APPROVES UKRAINIANS' USE OF ‘WE’RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT' AMID RUSSIAN INVASION

He certainly knows a thing or two about walking the fine line. Known for one of the most iconic songs of all time, Snider said he knew ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" was going to be a hit when he wrote the lyrics.

However, Snider had no idea the song would go ""far beyond the genre of the era.""

""It's also a folk song at this point that, and I'm sure it will continue on being shared from generation to generation,"" he said. ""It's really an honor to have created something that people connect with on so many levels, and to see that and just know that it will live on after I'm gone.""

""It's sort of like a blessing,"" he explained. ""When they said, you know, we want to use it to fight for stricter gun regulation, I said, 'I'm a gun owner. My wife says I have too many guns. I don't have any AK-47s. I don't have any assault rifles, and I definitely think we need intelligent gun control.' We've needed it for a long time. So, I said absolutely with my blessing. Use it.""

He has also battled against controversial usage of the anthem, which he said was written with intent for speaking up on ""personal freedom.""

""I will never say you can't use a song because that's censorship,"" he said of the many groups who have contacted him to use the hit. ""My problem is that people assume because it's my voice, and I'm the songwriter, the general public assumes you're endorsing them.""

While he has had decades of experience wearing platforms on stage, Snider said that performing as ""Doll"" on ""The Masked Singer"" was ""brutal.""

Snider – whose full name is Daniel Snider – performed in a sparkling blue dress with towering heels and a massive head piece concealing his identity throughout the FOX show.

""I think Bill Shatner said it best when it was revealed. He said, ‘Thank God I'm out of that suit,’"" Snider joked.

""I think it's something that the audience, viewers don't really get, and I wish they understood more. Well, same on ‘Celebrity Apprentice,’ actually – just how difficult it is for the performers.""

Snider added, ""Very disorienting, almost like a sensory deprivation situation.""

He gave some insight into the arduous process of perfecting his stage presence on ""The Masked Singer.""

""You know, that wasn’t the first time I sang that song last night? I sang it like eight times. Plus we were singing the song for the next episode,"" he said. ""My throat was burnt out.

""They were going, ‘Well, your gravelly voice,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah I was hoping it wasn’t so gravelly,' but I was torched. It was really difficult.""

Despite the physical discomfort wearing the suit and hours of singing, Snider was glad to be part of the experience.

""The audience loves that show,"" he said. ""It's such a guilty pleasure, and it really brings people joy. So, you know, that part … I'm really happy about.""

NIL, or name, image and likeness, has been a huge development in college sports since its inception, and athletes like the Cavinders have benefited tremendously from it.

They believe they could provide the blueprint for a younger generation.

""After playing all four years together and deciding not to take our fifth year, we just decided there’s more opportunities besides basketball,"" Haley Cavinder said.

Brittney Griner says she will 'continue to fight to bring home every American detained overseas',"Brittney Griner appeared at a women's empowerment luncheon Thursday in New York held by Rev. Al Sharpton, days after announcing she'll be releasing a memoir detailing her Russian jail experience.

Griner thanked those who advocated for her release and said she wants to return the favor.

""Everyone in this room that came together, that sent up every prayer, it reached me while I was there,"" Griner said. ""I want to continue to fight to bring home every American detained overseas.""

Griner's release came with some backlash because she was brought home in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout while retired U. S. Marine Paul Whelan remained in a Russian jail.

Sharpton presented Griner with an award, saluting the strength she exhibited during her detainment.

Grinder said she had a ""harrowing experience"" in Russia.

""I arrived in Moscow to rejoin the UMMC Ekaterinburg basketball team and was immediately detained at the airport. That day was the beginning of an unfathomable period in my life which only now am I ready to share,"" Griner wrote in a post on Instagram.

John Lennon's ex May Pang on Yoko Ono pushing her to have affair with married Beatle,"May Pang was just 22 years old when she reluctantly became John Lennon’s girlfriend — at the request of his wife Yoko Ono.

The couple’s former assistant, who found herself in the middle of an 18-month romance with the ""Imagine"" singer, is telling her story in a new documentary, ""The Lost Weekend: A Love Story."" The film, which made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2022, features rarely heard home recordings and a candid interview with Lennon’s eldest son, Julian.

In it, Pang aims to set the record straight on her story, one that has become part of rock mythology since Lennon died in 1980. A spokesperson for Ono, 90, indicated to Fox News Digital that there would be no response at this time regarding Pang's documentary.

""It’s hard to believe, but it is 50 years now since my relationship with John began,"" the 72-year-old told Fox News Digital. ""There was so much of my own story being told by other people that had no idea. It got the best of me after a while. It was my life, and everybody else is telling it. Many people still think I only spent a weekend with him. They didn't know the truth.""

Pang, the American-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, grew up in New York City’s Spanish Harlem during the ‘60s, when she discovered her first love – rock ‘n’ roll. In the film, Pang admitted her favorite Beatle as a teen was Ringo Starr, noting she ""was partial to blue eyes.""

In 1969, the 19-year-old scored a gig as an office assistant for Apple Records, the Fab Four’s label. In 1970, Lennon and Ono relocated from London to New York. Pang, eager to escape the mundane office life, began working as the couple's personal assistant.

BEATLE RINGO STARR REFLECTS ON SPREADING 'PEACE AND LOVE' FOLLOWING THE '60S: 'IT WAS PART OF HOW WE FELT'

""They were doing two movies, ‘Up Your Legs Forever’ and ‘Fly,’"" Pang recalled. ""It was a bit kooky, but I rolled with it because it was fun. … And they were larger than life. You read about them all the time in the papers, how they were spreading their message of peace around the world. And when I started to work for them, everything became fast paced. I didn’t get much sleep.""

Lennon, 10 years older than Pang, had been married to Ono since 1969. However, the pair, depicted as soulmates, had hit a rough patch. Ono, who wanted some time apart, was eager to save her marriage. It was in 1973 when Ono asked the young assistant to date her husband in hopes of keeping him company.

Pang said that day seemed like any other at the couple’s office — at first.

""She came in and sat across from me and said, ‘I’ve gotta talk to you,'"" Pang recalled. ""In my head, I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God, I haven’t even had my first cup of coffee yet. … I grab my pad, my pen, and I’m ready to write. And she said, ‘John and I are not getting along.’ I said, ‘I’m so sorry to hear [that].' And then she says, ‘You know, John’s gonna go out with other people.’ And I thought, ‘OK, now we’re into another territory. Who can this be? We are adding another person to this mix?’ And then she says, ‘But you know what? You don’t have a boyfriend.’""

""I’m going, ‘I’m not interested, I’m not interested,’"" said Pang. ""She goes, ‘Oh, I know, but I think you’ll be good for him.’ I said, ‘I don’t want to go out with him.’ Now, people don’t realize I’ve worked there for three years. I was very happy with the job. … That’s all I wanted to do. All of a sudden, she says, ‘Go out with John Lennon.’ He was not John Lennon as everybody out there saw him. He was John Lennon, this man I worked for. … So I wasn’t interested.""

""It was hard to process,"" she added. ""I said no. And she kept saying, ‘You’d be good for him.’ She walks out of the room, and I just sat there. For a split second, I’m going, ‘What just happened?’ And tears started to just form in my eyes. I didn’t know where I was going. I didn’t know what to do.""

'50S STAR ANGIE DICKINSON ON FRANK SINATRA AND WHY SHE NEVER MARRIED 'LOVE OF MY LIFE'

At first, neither Pang nor Lennon seemed interested. But their attraction for each other became undeniable. He first stole a kiss from her at the elevator of the Dakota, where he lived with Ono. Soon, Lennon ""charmed the pants off of me."" In the film, Pang admitted she cried the first time they had sex, not knowing where the relationship would lead.

The pair bonded over their mutual love of music. Pang attempted to go with the flow as Lennon let his hair down. The two became inseparable, she said.

""I didn’t think he was attracted to me,"" Pang admitted. ""It was a big surprise. Despite everything that was said, it was he who pursued it more than anything else. I was just trying to hold back. … And you don’t want to be hurt either.""

At first glance, the couple seemed like any other. They shared deep conversations over songs, enjoyed dinners together at a local diner, jetted off to Los Angeles, where they spent time with other musicians and made each other laugh behind closed doors. Lennon drew comedic sketches for Pang. For her 23rd birthday, Lennon bought her an orange Plymouth Barracuda.

Pang claimed that Ono, suspecting possibly more was unfolding, would call up to 15 times a day to check in.

The whirlwind romance was not all sweetness. In the film, Pang described how Lennon, in a drunken rage, smashed up their LA pad. She also detailed how Lennon recorded his ""Rock ‘n’ Roll"" album with notorious music producer Phil Spector, who, according to Pang, liked poppers and guns.

The relationship carried on and, in 1974, the pair moved in together. Pang even encouraged Lennon to heal his relationship with Julian. At the time, he hadn’t seen his firstborn in several years.

""He hadn’t seen [his ex-wife Cynthia] since he walked out the door,"" Pang explained. ""It was time for Julian to come to visit him, and [Lennon] was really nervous. I remember he kept pacing like a tiger, smoking up a storm. I told him, ‘You’re not alone. I know this is hard, but I’ll be there.’ I just thought it was so important for Julian’s sake. I just remember Julian running into his arms. It was beautiful. I just wanted to be there as a buffer. And they all finally got a chance to sit down and talk about how they felt. Once that was cleared up, he didn’t have this angst anymore. … That’s exactly what I wanted for Julian.""

As the relationship between father and son healed, Pang developed a lifelong friendship with Cynthia. It was one that lasted until Cynthia died in 2015.

'ST. ELSEWHERE' STAR BONNIE BARTLETT DANIELS REFLECTS ON PAST OPEN MARRIAGE: 'THAT WAS VERY PAINFUL'

According to the film, Lennon initially agreed to Ono’s request for a divorce in 1974. He even told Pang, ""I’ll be a free man in six months."" But it never happened. Lennon claimed he was receiving pushback from Ono. Pang said she believed the relationship surprised Ono, who then wanted her husband back. Knowing that Lennon was trying to quit smoking to conserve his famous voice, Ono allegedly told him she knew a hypnotist who could help him. All he had to do was come back home.

Once Lennon went back to Ono to take her up on her offer, Pang knew her relationship was over. The couple called it quits in early 1975. Over the years, she said, they would see each other.

Pang said she last spoke to Lennon during Memorial Day weekend 1980. It was a nearly two-hour conversation over the phone that concluded with Lennon saying, ""I’m going to see you soon.""

They never saw each other again.

""Our time together never really ended as it were,"" she said. ""We didn’t get closure.""

In December 1980, Lennon was gunned down by a crazed fan outside his New York City apartment. He was 40.

Over the years, a devastated Pang reinvented herself, pursuing careers in writing and jewelry design. Today, she looks back at her time with Lennon fondly, only choosing to remember the good times they shared, not what might have been.

""I don’t know if I have actually coped with [his loss] completely,"" Pang admitted. ""I just think of the happy moments, the things that we’ve done together. I feel like he’s still surrounding me. So, no matter what, he’s there.""",2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z
LSU basketball announces the death of former star player Wayne Sims,"Wayne Sims, best known for his standout college basketball career, died Wednesday, the LSU athletic department confirmed. He was 54.

Sims appeared in an impressive four NCAA men's basketball tournaments over the course of his career with the LSU Tigers.

His cause of death was not immediately released.

During his run at LSU, Sims played alongside Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal, former Denver Nuggets player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Vernel Singleton.

The Tigers were crowned Southeastern Conference champions during Sims' senior year.

""He brought the best out in players, and everyone liked him,"" Sims' coach at LSU, Dale Brown, said in a statement.

""He was a team player — didn’t get the credit maybe he deserved for the great run they had, but he was a wonderful person. He was never a flashy guy that needed stardom, but he was the base to our team.""

Wayne’s son Wayde also played two seasons for the Tigers before he was fatally shot during an off-campus altercation on the eve of LSU’s first scheduled practice before the 2018-19 season.

Following their son’s death, Wayne Sims and wife Fay set up the Baton Rouge-based Wayde Sims Foundation.

""He and Fay worked tirelessly to keep Wayde’s memory alive,"" said McNeese State coach Will Wade, who was Wayde Sims’ coach at LSU. ""I’ll never forget Wayne and Fay saying that God will find a way to save lives through Wayde’s death.""

Ricky Blanton, Wayne Sims' former teammate, said he was saddened by the news.

""I was very sad to hear of the passing of my good friend, Wayne Sims. He was a great teammate and even better person. If you knew Wayne, you could not help but be embraced by his extreme kindness. He will be missed by everyone who knew him.""

Wayne Sims, listed at 6-foot-7, 247 pounds during his playing days, appeared in 117 games for LSU, starting 74 and scoring 1,107 career points and grabbing 603 rebounds.

He is one of 21 LSU players to reach 1,000 career points and 500 rebounds and one of nine players in program history to appear in four NCAA Tournaments.

Sims scored 24 points in one of LSU’s most memorable upset victories, an 82-80 triumph over No. 2 Georgetown Jan. 28, 1989, a game played in the Superdome in New Orleans in front of a crowd of 54,321.

""In the wake of World Athletics’ announcement, I think the best idea would be to have ‘biological female’ and ‘biological girls’ categories and then an ‘open’ category,"" she wrote. ""It would be a category for all-comers: men who identify as men; women who identify as women; women who identify as men; men who identify as women; non-binary — it would be a catch-all. This is already being explored in athletics and swimming in Britain.

""Biological females are most likely to compete in the biological female category, as that’s their best shot at winning and it maintains the principle of fairness. With an ‘open’ category there are no question marks, no provisos, no asterisks, no doubts. It’s a simple solution.

""Once somebody has gone through male puberty, there is no way to erase that physical advantage. You cannot simply turn back the clock, for instance by trying to lower testosterone levels.""

Navratilova said she hoped the decision would lead to other sports following its lead.

World Athletics’ decision on transgender female athletes came Thursday. The organization said it ""decided to prioritize fairness and the integrity of the female competition before inclusion.""

""Decisions are always difficult when they involve conflicting needs and rights between different groups, but we continue to take the view that we must maintain fairness for female athletes above all other considerations,"" World Athletics president Sebastian Coe added.

""We will be guided in this by the science around physical performance and male advantage which will inevitably develop over the coming years.

"Aaron Rodgers trade talks between Jets, Packers stalled after NFL owners meeting","The New York Jets are at a standstill with the Green Bay Packers over a trade involving quarterback Aaron Rodgers, and while one report on Wednesday signaled that Jets owner Woody Johnson wasn’t on board with the terms of a potential deal involving high draft picks, another report revealed the two sides haven’t spoken in weeks.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter said on ""NFL Live"" that the Jets and Packers haven’t spoken since the NFL Owners’ Annual League Meeting in Phoenix last month, which came just over a week after Rodgers had publicly announced his intentions to play for New York next season.

""My understanding is there hasn’t been a whole lot of conversation, if any, over the last couple of weeks going back to the owners' meetings,"" Schefter said.

""And so both sides now appear to be dug in, and we’ll see whether or not anything changes as we head up to the draft.""

ESPN’s Mike Greenberg also said Tuesday on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" that Rodgers has signaled to the Jets not to ""rush"" on making a deal.

""I’ve heard that Aaron has sent signals to the Jets that there’s no reason for them to rush, that he’s not coming until May anyway. So they’re not missing out on anything right now. So they should hold out as long as it takes and that ultimately they won’t wind up having to trade the 13th pick in the draft, which is what I think this ultimately comes down to,"" he said.

Details surrounding a potential trade offer were also revealed Wednesday but did not include a first-round pick in this year's draft.

According to Yahoo Sports' Charles Robinson, the Packers are looking for a second-round pick in this year’s draft and a first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, and they are willing to offer draft compensation if Rodgers does retire after the 2023 season.

But Robinson also reported that Johnson is hesitant over offering a first-round pick at all following the fallout from the Seattle Seahawks' blockbuster trade of Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos.

"Heart disease risk could be affected by one surprising factor, new study finds","The shape of a person's heart could be a predictor of future cardiac disease, a new study from Stanford University in California found.

Specifically, a heart that has a more spherical (round) shape could have a 47% higher likelihood of developing cardiomyopathy, which is a ""disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body,"" according to the Mayo Clinic.

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze more than 38,897 MRIs of healthy hearts from the UK Biobank, researchers examined a large biomedical database that includes information from 500,000 U. K. participants.

HEART DISEASE, THE SILENT KILLER: STUDY SHOWS IT CAN STRIKE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS

In the study, published in the journal Med on Wednesday, the researchers measured the roundness of the left ventricle, a typically cone-shaped chamber of the heart that pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.

Next, the researchers analyzed the participants’ health records to identify which ones had certain genetic markers for heart conditions.

They found an overlap between the rounder-shaped hearts and a predisposition for heart disease.

""Most people who practice cardiology are well aware that after someone develops heart disease, the heart will look more spherical,"" said Dr. Shoa Clarke, a preventive cardiologist and an instructor in the Stanford School of Medicine’s departments of medicine and pediatrics, in a press release announcing the findings.

Clarke was one of the study’s senior researchers, along with Dr. David Ouyang of the Smidt Heart Institute of Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.

The lead author was Milos Vukadinovic, a bioengineering student at UCLA.

The research team was surprised by the strong link between heart roundness and the risk for future cardiomyopathy, Clarke told Fox News Digital.

""It was possible that heart shape may not have told us anything different than measurements of heart size or strength,"" he said.

""But it turned out that heart shape provides additional information about risk and genetics that is not picked up by other measurements.""

Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, said that when used properly, AI can be ""a clinician’s friend"" when evaluating heart health.

5 SIMPLE WAYS TO HELP PREVENT HEART DISEASE THIS YEAR

""In this instance, AI appeared to show a correlation between roundness of the heart and development of cardiomyopathy, where the heart balloons out and is a less effective pump,"" Dr. Siegel told Fox News Digital.

""This makes some sense, because the heart is typically more oblong,"" he explained.

""A rounder shape could conceivably put more stress or pressure on the valves and walls, potentially leading to this outcome."" He was not involved in the new study.

If the new study is confirmed, it would add another element to how cardiologists examine patients' echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart), said Dr. Siegel.

The researchers believe this is just the tipping point for much more data-rich information from MRI imagery.

""A key takeaway of our work is that current strategies for assessing the heart are good, but they were established decades ago, before the era of big data,"" Clarke told Fox News Digital.

""When used properly, AI can be a clinician’s friend.""

""We now have the opportunity to think more broadly and ask what other features of the heart can tell us about the risk and the biology of disease.""

Co-author Ouyang told the journal Med that there is an extensive amount of untapped information that physicians aren’t currently using.

The study authors indicated that more research is needed into how heart shape can or should be considered when making medical decisions.

New Jersey college student 'viciously assaulted' at knifepoint in her dorm room,"A New Jersey man was arrested this week after forcing a college student into her dorm room at Fairleigh Dickinson University and assaulting her at knifepoint for several hours on Easter Sunday, according to officials.

Jayshawn Moore, 21, is facing a litany of charges, including first-degree kidnapping, first-degree aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault, burglary, terroristic threats, and other counts. He has no connection to the university.

Police referred to the crime as a ""domestic violence incident"" and said the victim was ""known"" to Moore, but the nature of their relationship is unclear.

The victim was returning to campus on Sunday evening after spending the weekend with her family when she encountered Moore, who was allegedly waiting inside the dorm.

""The suspect surprised the victim outside of her dorm room and physically forced her into the [room] where he held her hostage for several hours, threatened her with a knife, strangled her, as well as physically and sexually assaulted her,"" Florham Park police chief Joseph Orlando said Thursday.

Why Thomas Edison should be considered the patron saint of homeschooling,"PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Fox News contributor and author Raymond Arroyo discuss this topic and more on ""Fox & Friends"" on Tuesday, March 21 at 7:30 a.m. ET.

Though Thomas Alva Edison’s creations and ingenuity are legendary, most don’t realize that Edison almost wasn’t the world’s greatest inventor.

A curious and reckless child, young Edison wanted to know the inner workings of the world around him and was not afraid to dive into the canal behind his house or into a grain elevator to find answers.

At five, his zeal to understand fire ended with the family barn in ashes and a whipping from his dad. His at times dangerous curiosity and endless questions drove his father to distraction, who wrote the boy off as ""a dunce."" But his mother saw something else in her Al.

GREATEST INVENTOR OF ALL TIME WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITHOUT A KEY PERSON IN HIS LIFE

While creating my new ""Turnabout Tales"" picture book series for ZonderKidz/HarperCollins, I spied a common thread that ran through Edison’s life and those of other historic figures. Each found themselves in a moment of crisis where a decision made not only changed the course of their lives but the course of history itself.  I believe each of us has a ""Turnabout Tale,"" whether in our past or in the future.

Edison’s ""Turnabout"" really began at age eight.  Little Al was registered at the Reverend GB Engle’s schoolhouse in 1855.   The rote lessons and memorization were likely boring to Al.  He daydreamed through classes and his biographers think he may have had ADHD.  Edison said of this period: ""The teachers did not sympathize with me and…my father thought I was stupid.""  His teacher did as well.

One day, in front of Al, the Reverend Engle complained that the boy was ""addled"" and ""unable to be taught."" Al ran home in tears. The next day, Mrs. Edison appeared at the school, upbraided the teacher, insisted that her son had more smarts than even the Reverend and that she would educate Al herself.  Astoundingly, this marked the end of Edison’s formal education and the beginning of the great inventor.

Nancy Edison was a teacher by trade and equipped her son with a combination of literary classics and science manuals that fed his passion. She encouraged Al’s daring, hands on experimentation.

Young Edison absorbed the theory of the books he read while practically applying them; constructing his own telegraph to a neighbor’s house and dabbling with chemicals in his home lab. Despite a few explosions in the basement and acid burns on her furniture, Ms. Edison indulged Tom’s pursuits.

I don’t know why Thomas Edison isn’t the patron saint of home-schooling. He said late in life: ""My mother was the making of me…she let me follow my bent. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should very likely have never become an inventor.""

It was this line, that I discovered accidentally, that led me to write ""The Unexpected Light of Thomas Alva Edison"" and to try to capture this neglected bit of history for our own time.

Like a lot of children, Edison was underestimated and disparaged at a young age. Being deaf from the age of 12, he was likely withdrawn. But where others would regard the loss of hearing a liability, Edison saw it as a blessing.

""Deafness probably drove me to reading."" Edison said once. It also gave him time to think and ponder. How incredible it is that a man who had to bite down on a piece of wood to hear sounds in his laboratory, created the phonograph, the telephone receiver, and the microphone.

But it was the model of discovery and innovation that he learned from his mother that would mark the rest of his creative life. Edison confronted challenges with his head and his hands.

Surrounded by books, at his ""Invention Factory"" in Menlo Park, New Jersey and later at the Edison Labs in West Orange, New Jersey he would hurl himself across worktables to tinker and feel his way through the process of creation.

Edison would fill thousands of notebooks with ideas for new inventions. By the end of his life, he would file more than 1,000 patents and transform the lives of millions around the globe.  The alkaline battery, the lightbulb, the motion picture camera, the tattoo pen, and the first electric car—all sprang from the mind of a boy who was tossed out of school and told he was too dumb to be taught.

At a moment when we are in danger of losing a sense of who we are, stories like Edison’s must be preserved and spread.  History reminds us of our past but more importantly lends us needed guidance as we move into the future.

Before we give up on the next average student or evict a child from the classroom, remember Thomas Edison and his mother.  If it hadn’t been for Nancy Edison, we might all still be in the dark.

The incredible ingenuity and light of Edison, which has spanned more than a century, might never have reached us were it not for a devoted parent who saw promise in her son where others only saw problems.

I hope this first ""Turnabout Tale: helps us all to see the possibility in every young life and to recognize the responsibility we as adults have to nurture the light within them.

"Rosa Parks, Sojourner Truth, MLK Jr. and other famous figures in the US","Black history in the U. S. dates back to 1619, when enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown Colony — present-day Williamsburg, Virginia.

Since then, Black Americans have persevered despite enormous challenges throughout the nation’s history and have been able to leave their mark on American culture.

Every February, the nation celebrates Black History Month by honoring the contributions of African Americans while also recognizing that the fight for racial justice continues today.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH QUIZ: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS MONTH OF TRIBUTE

The theme for February is ""Black Resistance,"" with festivals and events occurring in community centers across the U. S., according to the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.

From trailblazing abolitionists, scientists and artists to politicians, judges and civil rights leaders, numerous historical figures have done their part to shape America into the country it is today.

Here are 10 famous figures and the impactful contributions they made over the years.

Sojourner Truth was born in 1797 under the name Isabella Baumfree, in Ulster County, New York — where slavery was still legal at the time. She escaped to freedom in 1826 with her infant daughter after her owner refused to comply with the gradual abolition of slavery law New York had passed, the National Parks Service reports.

Baumfree later freed her son, who had been sold to an Alabama slave owner, by bringing her case to court.

By 1828, she became the first Black woman to win a case against a former slave owner.

Almost two decades later, Baumfree joined a Methodist church and changed her name to Sojourner Truth as she traveled the country to promote the abolition of slavery, the advancement of women’s rights, and religious tolerance.

Baumfree famously delivered her ""Ain’t I a Woman?"" speech in 1851 at the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention and met President Lincoln in 1864 through her work for the National Freedmen’s Relief Association. She also dictated a group of memoirs that were published in her book ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: a Northern Slave"" (1850).

Frederick Douglass, an American abolitionist and orator, was born as an enslaved person in February 1818 in Talbot County, Maryland.

He became a national leader in the abolitionist movement in New York and Massachusetts after escaping bondage as a disguised sailor, according to the Library of Congress.

Douglass delivered moving speeches and essays about his experience and anti-slavery stance, including his ""What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?"" speech (1852) and ""Life and Times of Frederick Douglass"" autobiography (1881).

Douglass also fought for civil reforms, including equal treatment for Black Americans and women, free public education and the end of capital punishment.

Harriet Tubman, conductor of the Underground Railroad and a Union Army spy, was born in March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, under the name Araminta Ross.

She changed her name in 1844 following her marriage to John Tubman, a free man, the National Parks Service reports. About five years after her marriage, Tubman escaped to freedom in Philadelphia, where slavery was abolished.

Tubman personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more.""

Tubman spent the next decade of her life rescuing family and friends in what is now known as the Underground Railroad. She personally made ""about 13 trips into Maryland"" to free her companions and provided a map to freedom to ""about 70 more,"" according to the NPS.

By the time the American Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Tubman served as an instrumental spy for the Union Army. She famously joined Colonel James Montgomery and his 2nd South Carolina Infantry during the group’s 1863 raid on Combahee River plantations, where Tubman provided scouting, nursing, and cooking aid.

Agriculture scientist and educator George Washington Carver was born in the early- or mid-1860s in Diamond, Missouri.

While initially enslaved with his mother and sister, Carver was separated from his family after he was kidnapped in a slave raid. The Carver family retrieved him from his captors and eventually taught him to read, write, and care for plants after the abolishment of slavery in 1865.

Carver went on to attend various schools in the Midwest. He was accepted into the botany program at the Iowa State Agricultural School and became the first African American to earn a bachelor's and master's of science degree.

Carver’s agricultural research and inventions led to advancements in soil health, conservation, and rotational peanut crops, the USDA reports.

Carver famously made a variety of peanut-based products and herbal concoctions, and later became a professor at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, a historically Black college.

American journalist and civil rights advocate Ida B. Wells was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on July 16, 1862, five months and two weeks before the delivery of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Wells moved to Tennessee and became a teacher in adulthood. Wells began to write political articles after she won a lawsuit against the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in 1887 for being forcibly removed from a first-class train car she paid for; that decision was ultimately overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court, Mississippi History reports.

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP.

Wells went on to write exposés about school segregation and lynching in Memphis until she was forced to move to New York City for her safety. She continued her investigative reports about disparities in the American education system under segregation, mistreatment that African Americans experienced, and the road to women’s suffrage.

Some of her famous written works include ""Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"" (1893) and ""Mob Rule in New Orleans"" (1900).

Wells later moved to Chicago and took on a leadership role at the NAACP. She also ran for the Illinois legislature before her death in 1931.

American sociologist and historian William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on Feb. 23, 1868, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Du Bois was the first Black graduate of Searles High School in 1884 and later earned his bachelor of arts from Fisk University in Tennessee, America’s Library reports.

He then earned a second bachelor’s degree, a master's and a doctorate in history from Harvard University. During his schooling, Du Bois also traveled to Germany for a fellowship at the University of Berlin, where he studied the works of famous social scientists, including Gustav von Schmoller and Heinrich von Treitschke.

Du Bois became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

Du Bois used his education and talents as a writer and editor to address race relations in the U. S. and advance rights for Black Americans. He published 16 books on sociology, history and politics, including ""Black Reconstruction in America,"" ""The Souls of Black Folk"" and ""The Talented Tenth.""

Du Bois became a professor of history, sociology and economics at Atlanta University, a historically Black research college with Methodist roots. He also became a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America’s oldest and largest civil rights organization.

The NAACP characterizes itself as a grassroots organization that ""builds Black political power to end structural racism.""

Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the U. S. Supreme Court, was born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore.

He was formerly named Thoroughgood Marshall, but he legally changed his name at the age of 6. Marshall later became interested in the law as a high school student after he was ordered to read the U. S. Constitution as a punishment for a prank he pulled, United States Courts reports.

From that moment, he was inspired to become a lawyer after he realized not all African Americans were able to enjoy the liberties laid out in the Bill of Rights.

Marshall attended Lincoln University and then Howard University School of Law, where he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Around 1935, Marshall found counterarguments for segregation when he reviewed the U. S. Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which stated facilities could be divided by race if they were ""separate but equal.""

Marshall found that this doctrine was flawed and created discrepancies in the education children received, which led him to take on and win several landmark cases.

His most famous case that changed the American school system was Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.

President Kennedy appointed Marshall as a federal judge to the U. S. Court of Appeals in 1961. Four years later, Marshall was appointed as solicitor general by President Johnson. By 1967, Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court — where he served as a justice until 1991.

Civil rights leader Rosa Parks was born on Feb. 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, under the name Rosa Louise McCauley. She married her husband Raymond Parks in 1932 and worked as a seamstress before she became a member of the Montgomery National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Parks Service reports.

At age 42, Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat at the front of a bus to a White passenger and move to the back, a practice that wasn’t uncommon during the time of Jim Crow.

The arrest inspired 17,000 African Americans to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which lasted for 13 months and hurt the city bus service’s revenue. Parks remained a symbol of resilience during this time.

The boycott finally came to an end in 1956 when the Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks moved to Detroit a year later, working with the NAACP and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., to fight homelessness, and even created a job training institute.

She earned a Congressional Gold Medal of Honor in 1991.

Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress, was born in Brooklyn, New York, on Nov. 30, 1924, under the name Shirley Anita St. Hill.

In her youth, Chisholm was partially raised by her grandparents in Barbados before her family settled in Brooklyn for good, the U. S. House of Representatives reports.

Chisholm earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's in elementary education from Columbia University. She worked as a teacher, daycare center director and educational consultant before entering politics.

Chisholm was elected to the New York state legislature in 1964 and then the U. S. House of Representatives in 1968, when she represented Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant district for seven terms. Chisholm made waves in the House when she appealed her initial committee assignment in agriculture to find a committee more relevant to her district.

She was reassigned to the Veterans Affairs Committee and moved up to the Education and Labor Committee, where she dedicated herself to advancing equal education and employment opportunities. In 1972, Chisholm, a Democrat, also became the first African American to run for a major political party's nomination for president.

Civil rights leader Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was born on Jan. 15, 1929, in Atlanta. Post-college, King dedicated his life to fighting racial inequality with peaceful resistance to unjust laws.

He notably protested segregation in public schools, restaurants and hotels with nonviolent sit-ins, America’s Library reports. King also delivered moving speeches that challenged the mistreatment that African Americans faced under Jim Crow laws and called for equality.

King delivered his most famous speech, ""I Have a Dream,"" on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

King's notable accomplishments during the Civil Rights Movement (1954-1968) included the Montgomery Bus Boycott; pleading for peace when U. S. marshals were called in to disperse the Freedom Riders (segregation protesters riding on interracial buses) in Montgomery; and leading the Voting Rights March from Selma to Montgomery, which was met with violent resistance.

NYC charter school to pay teachers $140K to promote student achievement,"A New York City charter school vows to pay its teachers $140K for the 2023-2024 school year.

The Equity Project Charter School [TEP] announced that they’re boosting teacher salaries to $140,000 for the 2023-24 school year, which is more than double the national average and significantly higher than the average salary for New York City public school teachers.

Prior to boosting teacher salaries, TEP was originally paying teacher salaries of $125,000 when it opened in 2009. That was almost twice as much as the average New York City public school teacher earned.

According to Teach For America [TFA], a teacher with 10 years of experience would earn a base salary of $86,280, and a maximum salary of $101,441. Teachers at TEP will also be eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to $35,000.

TWITTER DOESN'T LET RANDI WEINGARTEN GET AWAY WITH BLAMING TEACHER SHORTAGE ON 'CULTURE' WARS: 'LOST THE PLOT'

""Higher teacher salaries also help students. Knowing the profound effect teacher quality has on student achievement, a public charter school in New York City founded and led by TFA alums has made teacher pay a priority for 14 years,"" TFA reported.

According to TEP's website, 90% of TEP students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, which is a federal measure of poverty. TEP has 1080 students in kindergarten through 8th grade.

They also note that 91% of their students are Latino and 8% African American students.

""These teachers are valued in a way that matches the redefined expectations set for them: a $140,000 annual salary and the opportunity to earn a significant annual bonus based on school-wide performance,"" their website reads.

Since the pandemic, school districts across the country were struggling to fill hundreds of open teaching positions in the remaining weeks of summer before the 2022-2023 school year kicked off.

Since teacher pay has been a primary concern, lawmakers suggested legislation that would get rid of relicensing requirements for teachers when they move across state lines — an oftentimes cumbersome and costly process of waiting periods, licensing fees, and expensive exams.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNDER THE WIRE TO HIRE HUNDREDS OF TEACHERS BEFORE SCHOOL YEAR STARTS

The idea for an Interstate Teacher Mobility Compact was first proposed by the U. S. Department of Defense and is designed, in part, to support military spouses. It would effectively allow teaching licenses to be viable across members of the compact, cutting through the current 50-state patchwork of disparate requirements.

In 2020, Colorado paid teachers an estimated average of just over $60,000 annually, below the national average of about $65,000, according the National Center for Education Statistics, even though it's one of the most expensive states to live in. On those salaries, only about 20% of available homes in Colorado are affordable to teachers, according to a study by the Keystone Policy Center.

School districts across the country have been struggling with an exodus of teachers since the pandemic, as teachers reported burnout stemming from the uncertainty during lockdowns, including switching to remote learning, hybrid learning, and eventually transitioning back to in-class instruction.

TEACHERS' UNIONS PUSH DEMOCRATS TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE ON CRITICAL RACE THEORY

A survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that 44% of public schools report having full- or part-time teacher vacancies.

The survey, published in March 2022, also found that 61% of public schools reporting at least one vacancy cited the pandemic for the open jobs. Most of the vacancies were due to resignations, not retirement, the survey reported.

About 300,000 public school teachers and staff have left the field between Feb. 2020 and May 2022, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A survey from the National Education Association in February found that 55% of teachers reported that they are thinking about leaving the profession, and 79% of teachers report dissatisfaction with their careers, according to a July American Federation of Teachers survey.

"Canadian university hosts seminar asking, 'How can math be racist?'","A Canadian university on Tuesday hosted a seminar on math being ""racist.""

Simon Fraser University’s, [SFU] located in British Columbia, Canada, held a seminar asking ""How can math be racist?"" and that addressed ""unpacking oppressive structures and bias in math and science.""

Participants of the course were encouraged to read two books in advance of the event, Mathematics, the Inuit and Colonialism and What does Anti-Racism in Mathematics Look like?

SFU hosted the event in association with the Simon Fraser Public Interest Group [SFPIRG]. According to SFPIRG’s website, they are ""a student-funded and student-directed resource centre dedicated to social and environmental justice.""

SFPIRG also claim to be a ""non-partisan"" group, but note that they are ""very political,"" their website reads.

In recent months, a long list of controversial, race-based teachings have emerged from different areas of the U. S.

The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) recently encouraged teachers to register for training that encourages ""ethnomathematics"" and argues, among other things, that White supremacy manifests itself in the focus on finding the right answer.

An ODE newsletter advertised a Feb. 21 ""Pathway to Math Equity Micro-Course,"" which is designed for middle school teachers to make use of a toolkit for ""dismantling racism in mathematics.""

Part of the toolkit included a list of ways ""white supremacy culture"" allegedly ""infiltrates math classrooms."" Those include ""the focus is on getting the 'right' answer,"" students being ""required to 'show their work,'"" and other alleged manifestations.

"Texas hospital sees 30 infant deaths in 15-month period, warns parents of co-sleeping dangers","A single hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, reported that it has seen 30 infant deaths due to unsafe sleeping conditions since January 2022, according to a press release issued last week from Cook Children’s Medical Center.

The hospital is sharing the statistics in an effort to raise awareness of the dangers to babies posed by co-sleeping, as well as the dangers posed by blankets, pillows and other fabrics.

The babies were not born at Cook Children’s — but were transported there after the incidents or deaths.

OHIO WOMAN'S SECOND BABY KILLED 'AS A RESULT OF CO-SLEEPING': WHAT IS CO-SLEEPING?

The majority of the reported infant deaths occurred when a parent or caregiver slept in the same bed with the baby.

Other causes included ""infants asleep on a pillow with a bottle, in the crib with a blanket or pillow, in a recliner or couch next to a sleeping adult or wearing a loose-fitting T-shirt that covered her face,"" the press release stated.

The age group that experienced the highest number of deaths from unsafe sleeping conditions was 2 to 6 months old.

Sharon Evans, the traumatic injury prevention coordinator at Cook Children’s, said the 30 infant deaths over the past 15 months is the highest number she has seen since she joined the staff 15 years ago.

""We don't have to wait for it to happen in our home to be aware of the danger. We want them to understand that this is a very preventable situation,"" said Candle Johnson, a registered pediatric nurse at Cook Children's Renaissance Neighborhood Clinic in South Fort Worth, in the hospital’s press release.

""Let's be proactive today so we don't have to be reactive tomorrow. If a fatality occurs, how do we move forward when we could have prevented it in the first place?""

""Let's be proactive today so we don't have to be reactive tomorrow.""

Johnson has made it her mission to educate families on the dangers of co-sleeping — which is when the baby shares a bed with a parent or caregiver — and the importance of having the baby sleep alone in a crib, bassinet or other flat, contained surface.

PEDIATRIC EXPERTS GIVE NEW RECOMMENDATIONS TO KEEP SLEEPING BABIES SAFE

She said many women succumb to the temptation to have the baby sleep next to them or with them while breastfeeding.

""I advise against this practice because, although it may be easier, it is not safe,"" Johnson said in the press release.

""No one can control your bodily functions when you are sleeping. When you are in a deep sleep and your baby is next to you, you cannot say, ‘I am not going to roll over on him.’""

Other potential dangers include the baby suffocating under covers or pillows or getting trapped under the adult’s body or between the headboard and mattress, Johnson said in the release.

Fox News Digital reached out to Cook Children’s Medical Center for additional comment.

Approximately 3,400 babies every year die from unsafe sleeping conditions in the U. S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Some parents may face challenges that could put their babies at a higher risk of death from unsafe sleeping conditions, Johnson shared.

Those include lack of knowledge about optimal sleeping environments, financial hardship that makes it difficult to purchase a crib or bassinet, or a mistrust of medical advice, the press release stated.

Evans pointed out that in many cases, parents unknowingly may put their babies in danger.

""Parents want to do their best, but are often exhausted from feeding their babies at night and from other aspects of caring for a baby,"" she said in the Cook Children’s press release.

""Nobody does it intentionally. I don't think any of the parents who sleep with the baby think there could be any danger.""

Cook Children’s is just one of many hospitals that have seen the tragic loss of infant life due to unsafe sleeping arrangements.

Dr. Jenelle Ferry, a neonatologist and director of feeding, nutrition and infant development at Pediatrix Medical Group in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has experienced many cases of babies dying from unsafe sleeping situations, such as co-sleeping with a caregiver and being put to sleep with soft blankets — leading to suffocation.

""Sometimes a baby is able to be revived, but then suffers permanent severe brain injury from lack of oxygen, which may take away"" the baby's ability ""to ever learn to walk or talk,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Ferry said she's also experienced a case of co-sleeping in the hospital after a baby was born, which resulted in the infant falling out of the bed — and suffering a fractured skull and bleeding in the brain.

""These cases are heartbreaking because they can be prevented.""

""These cases are devastating because they involve babies so full of life and potential, but also because they involve loving and well-meaning parents who are usually exhausted and may not fully comprehend how something so seemingly simple could have such life-altering consequences,"" she said.

""These cases are heartbreaking because they can be prevented,"" Ferry continued.

Caregiver education is a critical part of preventing accidental infant death, said Ferry. This applies not just to parents, but also to babysitters and any other family members who will be caring for the infant.

""The hospitals I’ve worked in all have some degree of education on safe sleep,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""This should also be part of regular pediatrician visits.""

Ferry said parents should be educated about the importance of placing babies on their backs to sleep, keeping them in their own crib or bassinet on a firm, flat surface, and removing blankets and pillows from the sleep environment.

RECORD-BREAKING TWINS BORN FOUR MONTHS EARLY DEFY ODDS: ‘GOD WAS IN CONTROL’

Any other sleeping surfaces, such as portable cribs or other devices, should meet the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

In 1994, the National Institute of Child Health and Infant Development and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) launched the ""Back to Sleep"" campaign to spread awareness and prevention measures for sudden infant death.

It was later renamed ""Safe to Sleep"" to include a wider range of recommendations for reducing infant suffocation and promoting safe sleep.

Cook Children’s has launched its own Safe Sleep for Babies Council, which provides portable cribs and sleeping bags to families that need them.

Many parents make the mistake of thinking about an infant’s comfort in the same way they do their own, Ferry pointed out.

""While I may sleep more comfortably with a soft mattress topper and lots of blankets, I also have good head and neck control, can roll over and can remove a blanket from my face if it starts to interfere with my breathing,"" she explained.

With a baby, a similar environment will increase the risk of suffocation because he or she hasn’t yet developed. Only a tightly fitted sheet should be placed in a baby’s crib.

Instead of co-sleeping, the AAP recommends room sharing, which is when the baby’s crib or bassinet is kept in the room with the parent or caregiver.

Ferry said there are some safe tools available to help encourage good infant sleep, like swaddling blankets and sound machines that produce white noise to simulate the comforting sound of the womb.

MICHIGAN COUPLE WELCOMES 1ST BABY GIRL BORN INTO THE FAMILY AFTER 138 YEARS OF BOYS: 'UTTER SHOCK'

""A pacifier can be part of a safe sleep environment and has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of sudden infant death,"" she said.

The same safety precautions should apply outside the crib, too — when infants sleep with someone on a couch, cushion or soft chair, the risk of sleep-related death is up to 67 times higher, according to the AAP.

""Don’t leave infants sleeping on soft surfaces like couches or pillows unless they are directly supervised,"" Ferry said.

Instead of co-sleeping, the AAP recommends room sharing, which is when the baby’s crib, bassinet or play yard is kept in the room with the parent or caregiver.

This will make it easier to monitor, comfort and care for the baby while decreasing the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) by up to 50%.

The ""Safe to Sleep"" campaign focuses on the first year of life, as the highest risk for infant sleep-related deaths is in the first two to six months.

""As infants learn to roll over on their own, their risk of suffocation starts to decrease,"" Ferry told Fox News Digital.

""They should still be placed to sleep on their back — not their stomach and not their side — until one year of age, but if a baby rolls over on their own, the parents don’t need to worry about rolling him back over.""

Parkinson's researchers discover disease biomarker in key breakthrough,"An international group of researchers has discovered a new tool that can reveal a key pathology of Parkinson's disease in brain and body cells.

The identification of the new biomarker, known as abnormal alpha-synuclein, opens a new chapter for research, according to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research.

The foundation led the coalition and its landmark clinical study, Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI).

The findings were published Wednesday in the scientific journal The Lancet Neurology.

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN, 54, REVEALS PARKINSON'S DIAGNOSIS, SAYS 'DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR ME'

The tool, also known as the α-synuclein seeding amplification assay, is able to detect pathology in spinal fluid both for those diagnosed with the disease and individuals who are at high risk of developing it but have not yet been diagnosed or exhibited clinical symptoms.

The laboratory testing can confirm the presence of abnormal alpha-synuclein, which is detected in most people who have Parkinson's with what the foundation said was ""astonishing accuracy.""

Of those who participated in the testing, 93% were proven to have abnormal alpha-synuclein.

""We've never previously been able to see in a living person whether they have this alpha-synuclein biological change happening in their body,"" Dr. Todd Sherer, chief mission officer at The Michael J. Fox Foundation, said in a statement.

A protein normally found in the nervous system, alpha-synuclein — like amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease — can start to misfold and clump, damaging neurons and causing Parkinson’s disease to develop.

It has previously been possible to confirm the presence of the clumps solely through postmortem analysis. If abnormal alpha-synuclein is present in a spinal fluid sample, clumps form and the dye the sample is prepared with lights up.

The foundation notes the new tool ""takes advantage of a telling characteristic of alpha-synuclein that is pathologic,"" causing nearby, normal alpha-synuclein to misfold and clump.

The scientists tested some 1,123 samples of spinal fluid, showing the test was abnormal in fewer than 5% of people without Parkinson's.

The foundation said there is ""tremendous promise in optimizing"" the assay to measure the amount of alpha-synuclein present.

""I’m moved, humbled and blown away by this breakthrough, which is already transforming research and care, with enormous opportunity to grow from here,"" foundation co-founder Michael J. Fox said. ""I’m so grateful for the support of patients, families and researchers who are in it with us as we continue to kick down doors on the path to eradicating Parkinson’s once and for all.""

Optimized assays would also detect abnormal synuclein through a blood draw or nasal swab.

Massachusetts parents plea with high school hosting drag queen Missy Steak,"A group of parents in Massachusetts are planning to protest an event where a drag queen performer will perform for students during their school day.

Newton North High School on Friday will be hosting a drag queen named Missy Steak, who is expected to ""talk and sing to students at the 30-minute assembly as part of Transgender Bisexual Gay and Lesbian Awareness Day,"" NBC10 Boston reported.

The school’s principal has reportedly sent out an email to parents stating that students are not required to attend and may instead choose to go to the cafeteria while the rest of their class attends the performance. Even so, the protest will reportedly be held from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. at Newton Centre Green on Thursday.

NBC10 Boston quoted one parent, Henry Barbaro, who said, ""If it were up to me, I’d say, ‘Don’t do this event.’"" He went on to say, ""This performance is really forcing the hand of parents to either kind of do this draconian prohibition or say to their kids, ‘alright you can go,’ and hope for the best.""

CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICT PRESENTATION DIVIDES STUDENTS INTO CATEGORIES OF ‘PRIVILEGE’ OR ‘OPPRESSION’

NBC10 spoke to the drag queen about the parents’ concerns.

""I’m not going to be doing anything that’s un age-appropriate,"" Steak told the news outlet. ""It’s not sexual. It’s fun, it’s art, it’s clownery.""

""We come in, and we sing, or we dance, or we read, and we leave, and it’s just something we do for fun and to bring fun to other people,"" Steak added.

Steak as a performer reportedly has a history of controversial rhetoric.

In a ""Meet the Contestants"" segment for ""Drag Gauntlet"" that is viewable on YouTube, Steak said that the performer's ""secret weapon"" is ""my ability to maintain an erection despite all the anti-depressants I’m on.""

BIDEN'S EDUCATION SECRETARY LOBBIES COLLEGES TO DROP OUT OF US NEWS RANKING IN NAME OF EQUITY

Dr. Kathleen Smith, the Interim Superintendent of the school, provided Fox News Digital a statement defending the event.

""Students selected this specific performance because drag is a performance art that is often a part of LGBTQ+ events,"" she said. ""While there are many different types of drag performances, this particular performance is appropriate for the teenage audience. Like many of the performances in our schools, this performance seeks to deliver an important message - a message of kindness, inclusivity, and positivity - in a way that engages the teen audience.""

She went on to say, ""We are proud to support our LGBTQ+ students as they build awareness of and celebrate their identities within the context of our larger school community.""

This is not the first major controversy for Newton North High School, having previously chosen to cast a play exclusively with persons of color.

"Kemp signs bills aiming to improve school safety, literacy","* Georgia Gov. Kemp signed bills that are aimed at improving school safety and literacy assessments.

* Georgia bills would require schools in the state to perform literacy assessments, conduct campus shooting drills, and participate in anti-gang programs.

* Georgia Department of Education estimated that it would cost $70M to $80M to implement the requirements of the bill.

Gov. Brian Kemp signed new laws Thursday that will require Georgia schools to perform annual drills for responding to campus shooters early in the school year and to perform literacy assessments for younger students three times per year to see if they can read at grade level.

Kemp signed the education measures, which passed the legislature with bipartisan support, into law during a conference of Georgia school superintendents in Savannah.

The school safety bill, House Bill 147, was one of the Republican governor's legislative priorities for the beginning of his second term. It mandates that all Georgia public schools conduct an active shooter drill involving teachers and students by Oct. 1 each year. Students would be required to participate unless local districts allow parents to opt their children out.

The measure also requires the state Professional Standards Commission to create a safety and anti-gang program for training teachers and other school personnel in improving security and identifying youth gang members and gang recruitment efforts.

""We continue to put the safety of our students and educators first in the state of Georgia,"" Kemp told the school superintendents. He said his safety bill ""modernizes school safety protocols and equips those who work in our schools with the skills they need and want to protect our students in the classroom.""

GEORGIA BAKERY PUTS 'URGENT ALERT' ON FACEBOOK TO FIND CUSTOMER ACCIDENTALLY SOLD A DONUT WITH GLUTEN

At Kemp's urging, lawmakers earlier set aside $115 million to make school safety grants worth $50,000 available to every K-12 school in the state.

The governor also signed House Bill 538 and Senate Bill 211, which aim to improve literacy among students in kindergarten through third grade.

Depending on what test is being administered, there are different estimates of how many Georgia students read on grade level. The state’s own test had nearly 63% of students score below grade level on the English Language Arts test, although state education officials note a different figure shows 64% of third graders are reading proficiently. The National Assessment of Educational Progress, a nationwide test that allows for comparisons between states, found only 32% of Georgia fourth graders were proficient in reading in 2022.

""That's a problem because third grade marks that transition where you stop learning to read and you have to start reading to learn to go further in your education,"" said state Rep. Bethany Ballard, a Republican from Warner Robins who sponsored the House literacy bill. ""It’s that make-or-break turning point year.""

The state Department of Education will be required to develop a list of approved instructional materials for local school systems, and each school district must annually certify that it is using proven materials to support reading instruction. The state also must approve one or more screening tests to track reading progress, to be given three times yearly to children in kindergarten through third grade. The state must pay to make one of those tests freely available to all districts.

Children identified as falling behind will get an individualized plan within 30 days to help them catch up.

The reading assessments will begin in the 2024-2025 school year.

It’s unclear how the program will be funded. The state Department of Education estimated that it would cost $70 million to $80 million to implement the requirements of the bill, with most of the money being spent on a mandate to train or retrain teachers on the science of reading, structured literacy and foundational literacy skills by July 2025. Lawmakers argued over the cost and removed some costly elements, such as instructional coaches that could help teachers correctly translate lessons into practice.

"On this day in history, March 30, 1858, American visionary Hymen Lipman patents pencil with eraser","Philadelphia inventor Hymen L. Lipman rushed heroically to the aid of mistake-prone schoolchildren, draftsmen and artists everywhere when he secured the patent for the pencil with eraser on this day in history, March 30, 1858.

""Be it known that I, Hymen L. Lipman, of Philadelphia, in the county of Philadelphia and State of Pennsylvania, have invented a new and useful Lead-Pencil and Eraser;"" the visionary wrote in his patent application.

""I make a lead-pencil in the usual manner, reserving about one-fourth of the length, in which I make a groove of suitable size … and insert in this groove a piece of prepared India rubber (or other erasive substance) secured to said pencil by being glued at one edge.""

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 29, 1982, MICHAEL JORDAN HITS WINNING SHOT IN NCAA FINAL, LAUNCHING LEGEND

The eraser, he noted in his application, ""is particularly valuable for removing or erasing lines, figures, etc., and not subject to be soiled or mislaid on the table or desk"" — as if the purpose of an eraser was unknown to mid-19th century consumers.

Lipman was born to a Sephardic Jewish family in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1817.

He immigrated to the United States at age 21 and — like sliced-bread inventor Otto Rohwedder — set about reimagining everyday objects for the better.

""Lipman was also America’s first envelope manufacturer, and it was he who had the idea of adding adhesive to the back flap, so as to make sealing easier,"" reports Haaretz.com of Israel.

A pencil with an eraser is ""particularly valuable for removing or erasing lines, figures, etc., and not subject to be soiled or rnislaid on the table or desk."" — Hyman Lipman

""He devised a method for binding papers with an eyelet that preceded the stapler by two decades. And Lipman was the first to produce and sell blank postcards in the United States, in 1873.""

His pencil with eraser marked perhaps America's greatest contribution to pencilcraft.

The earliest writing tool, a stylus made with lead, dates back to antiquity, including the Egyptian and Roman Empires.

Pencils gained widespread popularity with the discovery of graphite deposits in the Borrowdale Valley in northern England in the 16th century.

""Although (graphite) resembled coal, it would not burn,"" reports the University of Waterloo (Canada) Earth Sciences Museum. ""It did, however, prove to be an excellent marker of sheepskins.""

Graphite also boasted one major advantage over the lead used in earlier pencils: graphite is not no poisonous.

""A market for it opened up around the end of the sixteenth century. German miners from Keswick in the early sixteenth century had made more progress mining the graphite from this site,"" the university notes.

Although commonly referred to as the lead pencil, even in Lipman's patent application, they are actually made of non-toxic graphite.

""Nuremberg, Germany, was the birthplace of the first mass-produced pencils in 1662. Spurred by Faber-Castell (established in 1761), Lyra, Steadtler and other companies, an active pencil industry developed throughout the 19th century industrial revolution,"" reports Pencil.com, published by pencil-wood supplier California Cedar Products Co.

""Early settlers depended on pencils from overseas until the war with England cut off imports. William Monroe, a Concord, Massachusetts cabinet-maker, is credited with making America’s first wood pencils in 1812.""

Yet before Lipman of Philadelpha, none apparently had the foresight to attach an eraser.

""Despite the usefulness of the innovation Lipman’s new product did not fly off the shelves at first,"" pencil enthusiast and blogger Patrick Murfin wrote in 2018.

Harvard establishes faculty-led 'council on academic freedom' focused on free speech,"Harvard's newly established Council on Academic Freedom plans to promote and uphold the principles of ""free inquiry, intellectual diversity, and civil discourse"" at the university, according to two Harvard professors on the council.

Professors Steven Pinker and Bertha Madras wrote in an op-ed for the Boston Globe that as members of the council, which was established in March, they plan to ""sponsor workshops, lectures, and courses on the topic of academic freedom.""

""We also intend to inform new faculty about Harvard’s commitments to free speech and the resources available to them when it is threatened,"" the Harvard professors wrote. ""We will encourage the adoption and enforcement of policies that protect academic freedom. When an individual is threatened or slandered for a scholarly opinion, which can be emotionally devastating, we will lend our personal and professional support.""

""When activists are shouting into an administrator’s ear, we will speak calmly but vigorously into the other one, which will require them to take the reasoned rather than the easy way out,"" they continued. ""And we will support parallel efforts led by undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.""

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY RANKS DEAD LAST IN THE NATION FOR COLLEGE FREE SPEECH: STUDY

According to the council's website, a small group of Harvard faculty members got together to discuss free speech at the university in November 2022 and determined ""that a faculty-led organization was needed to advocate for the free and civil exchange of ideas on campus.""

Pinker and Madras cite a study that found there have been 877 attempts to ""punish scholars for expression"" that might be protected under the First Amendment between 2014 and 2022.

""For every scholar who is punished, many more self-censor, knowing they could be next. It’s no better for the students, a majority of whom say that the campus climate prevents them from saying things they believe,"" they said.

The Harvard professors added that any community that is ""repressing disagreement"" is ""doomed"" and likely to ""chain itself to error.""

""An academic establishment that stifles debate betrays the privileges that the nation grants it and is bound to provide erroneous guidance on vital issues like pandemics, violence, gender, and inequality. Even when the academic consensus is almost certainly correct, as with vaccines and climate change, skeptics can understandably ask, 'why should we trust the consensus, if it comes out of a clique that brooks no dissent?'"" Pinker, the co-president of the council, and Madras said in their op-ed.

The pair of professors also criticized Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., in their op-ed, specifically his decision to appoint six new board members to the New College of Florida's vacant board seats.

They also characterized DeSantis' ""Stop Woke Act"" as an effort to ""counter left-wing muscle with right-wing muscle by stipulating the content of education through legislation.""

""The coin of the realm in academia ought to be persuasion and debate, and the natural protagonists ought to be the faculty.

Meet the American who invented sliced bread,"Otto Rohwedder gave the world an innovation by which all others are compared.

It’s the greatest thing since …  Well, it’s the greatest thing, according to popular acclaim.

""Sliced bread is the standard of all innovation, past, present and future,"" said Ed Douglas, a businessman, local historian and county commissioner from Chillicothe, Missouri.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST RECORDED THE BLUES, NATION'S ORIGINAL POP DIVA MAMIE SMITH

The world's first loaves of bread — sliced and packaged right out of the oven by Rohwedder’s unique innovation — rolled out of Chillicothe Baking Co. in 1928.

Douglas, nicknamed ""Sliced Bread Ed,"" has helped lead recent efforts by his community to declare itself the ""Home of Sliced Bread"" — and champion the memory of Rohwedder.

Humans began baking bread long before recorded history. It is enjoyed in myriad forms by all cultures in all corners of the world.

""For 15,000 years the epic of grain has been one with the epic of man,"" author Heinrich E. Jacob wrote in his celebrated 1944 tome, ""Six Thousand Years of Bread: Its Holy and Unholy History.""

Yet it took a hard-luck hawkeye to challenge all known history and write a better version of the ""epic of man.""

""Sliced bread is the standard of all innovation, past, present and future."" — ""Sliced Bread"" Ed Douglas of Chillicothe, Missouri

Rohwedder had no background as a baker, engineer or inventor.

But he had a preposterous dream to make bread better, even as the baking industry belittled his vision.

""Like any paradigm-changing invention, people could not conceive of sliced bread at the time,"" bread industry executive Allen Wright said in the inventor’s American Society of Baking Hall of Fame biography.

Rohwedder outwitted 10,000 years of bread-making tradition — which is why sliced bread has entered the cultural lexicon as the ultimate superlative of innovation.

Television, said comedian Red Skelton in 1951, ""is the greatest invention since sliced bread.""

The comparison by the celebrated entertainer stuck.

""For 15,000 years the epic of grain has been one with the epic of man."" — Author Heinrich E. Jacob

Sliced bread is so mundane today we assume it’s as old as fire or the wheel.

We forget it’s a recent invention in the annals of mankind. We certainly forgot the man who invented it.

Otto Frederick Rohwedder was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on July 7, 1880. His family made its way to Davenport at some point when he was a small child.

His father, Claus, was born in Kreis Dithmarschen, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in 1845. He arrived in Iowa in 1866 and worked as a stone mason contractor. He ""designed the stone work on many of Davenport’s prominent business buildings of former years,"" according to a 1922 obituary.

Rohwedder’s mother, Elizabeth Margaretha Margaret (Jannssen), known as Margaret, was also born in Schleswig-Holstein and arrived in Iowa in 1868.

She and Claus wed the following year. They had four sons, including Otto, and one daughter.

Rohwedder graduated from the Illinois College of Optometry in 1900 with a degree in optics. He ended up in the jewelry business, reportedly apprenticing in the trade as a teenager.

He operated three jewelry shops in St. Joseph, Missouri. The business struggled, by many accounts.

""Television is the greatest invention since sliced bread."" — Red Skelton in 1951

Nobody knows how or why, but at some point in his 30s, Rohwedder conceived the idea of devising a way to slice bread at a commercial level. He returned to his hometown of Davenport in 1916 and used the funds from the sale of his jewelry business to pursue his dream.

""He spent all his time raising money, building a factory and working on his designs,"" said ""Sliced Bread"" Ed.

Rohwedder’s mission to rewrite the epic story of man and bread appeared to end when fire destroyed his factory in nearby Monmouth, Illinois, in November 1917 — and with it his prototype bread slicer and the blueprints for it.

Rohwedder suffered one other setback, according to Douglas. He suffered a respiratory illness that doctors said might be fatal.

""They told him to give it up and get his affairs in order,"" Douglas said.

He ignored the advice. Instead, he went back to the drawing board, recreating his invention and soliciting the financing to produce it.

His health improved. And so did his inventive fortune.

Finally, by 1928, he had a prototype — a machine that could slice and package bread right out of the oven.

It proved harder to convince people of sliced bread’s potential.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED BAND-AIDS: COTTON BUYER AND DEVOTED HUSBAND EARLE DICKSON

The baking industry cast off Rohwedder as a crackpot, as preposterous as this seems in hindsight.

People baked their own bread at home or bought it by the loaf and cut it at home. The system worked well for thousands of years.

Nobody but Rohwedder thought there was a better way to sell bread.

""Few people in the industry believed that bread could be automatically sliced as it came off the assembly line,"" Aaron Bobrow-Strain wrote in his 2012 book, ""White Bread: A Social History of the Store-Bought Loaf.""

""Bread was too unruly … Most bakers actively opposed factory slicing.""

Rohwedder ""found no takers for the idea and had almost given up hope,"" the author added.

Yet Rohwedder finally found someone willing — perhaps equally desperate — to take a chance on his scheme to reinvent the staff of life.

His name was Frank Bench. He ran the struggling Chillicothe Baking Co. — and he was looking for a Hail Mary.

He ordered one of Rohwedder’s slicing machines on July 1, 1928, and touted the news in the local Constitution-Tribune on July 6.

""The idea of sliced bread may be startling to some people,"" the story read, attempting to reassure customers who were surely shocked by the concept.

""The Chillicothe Baking Company has installed a new multi-bladed bread slicer, which performs a feat which heretofore had been considered by bakers as being impossible — namely the slicing of fresh loaves.""

Sliced Kleen Maid Bread, the first loaves of pre-sliced bread in human history, rolled out of Chillicothe Baking Co. a day later, on July 7, 1928 — which just happened to be Rohwedder's 48th birthday.

The bakery claimed ""the distinction of being the first bakers in the world to sell sliced bread to the public.""

It was an instant sensation.

""Sales at the bakery shot up 1,000% in two weeks,"" Chillicothe tourism director Amy Supple told Fox News Digital.

Word quickly spread throughout the industry. Rohwedder’s records show orders for his machine began to flow in from across the Midwest.

By early 1929, he was selling slicing machines to bakeries and other businesses as far away as New York and Florida.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 18, 1943, GOVERNMENT BANS SLICED BREAD AMID WORLD WAR II RATIONING

The impact of sliced bread on the American household is evident by public reaction in 1943, at the depths of World War II, when the government announced it would begin rationing sliced bread.

The Roosevelt administration had already rationed sugar, meat and coffee.

But sliced bread proved too much to handle. The news incited a vocal rebellion among American homemakers.

""I should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale and saneness of a household,"" distraught mother Sue Forrester of Fairfield, Connecticut, claiming to speak on behalf of America’s housewives, lamented in a New York Times letter to the editor.

In 1928, the man who imagined sliced bread was treated as a crackpot. Fifteen years later, his invention was a necessity that people couldn’t live without, even in wartime.

Writes Bobrow-Strain, ""Otto Rohwedder, unappreciated and down on his luck, had achieved something nearly every member of the industrial baking establishment thought impossible.""

Otto Frederick Rohwedder died on Nov. 8, 1960 in Concord, Michigan. He was 80 years old.

He’s buried beside his wife, Carrie, beneath a humble headstone in Albion, Michigan.

He sold the invention by which all others are judged to Micro-Westco of Bettendorf, Iowa, in 1933, during the depths of the Great Depression, according to the American Society of Baking.

He worked for the company for the rest of his professional life as sales manager of its Rohwedder Bakery Machine Division — a sort of Johnny Appleseed of sliced-bread making. He retired in 1951.

The world continues to marvel at Rohwedder’s achievement. The phrase ""the greatest thing since sliced bread"" has become deeply ingrained in our language.

But it largely forgot the man.

""This is a very family-oriented community,"" Chillicothe Mayor Theresa Kelly told Fox News Digital. ""We’re very proud to be the home of sliced bread.""

""You know 1928 was just prior of the Great Depression and World War II. It was that Greatest Generation,"" said Supple. ""And they were really great but humble people.""

Chillicothe, Missouri, has recently rediscovered its history as the birthplace of the invention by which all others are compared. The community houses its visitors' bureau in the former bakery where sliced bread was born.

A large new mural touting it as the ""Home of Sliced Bread"" has quickly become the city’s most recognizable landmark and most popular Instagram attraction.

Perhaps it’s asking too much. Bread, and now sliced bread, is so ingrained in human existence, we instinctively assume it’s always been there, like the oceans or the stars. Surely something so essential to life could not be invented by man.

"Pregnant women in New Jersey ate poppy seeds, then tested positive for opioid drug use","Fans of the hit sitcom ""Seinfeld"" may recall the episode in which Elaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) hilariously tested positive for opium after eating a muffin containing poppy seeds — which got her kicked off a work trip to Kenya.

But for two pregnant women in New Jersey, the real-life repercussions of eating poppy seeds and then testing positive for drugs weren't nearly as funny.

The women ate bagels with poppy seeds last year before heading to two separate hospitals to give birth to their children. Hospital staff administered drug tests to both women — which came back positive for opioids, as a press release from the New Jersey ACLU indicated.

OPIOID DRUGS CAUSE MORE THAN HALF OF YOUNG CHILDREN’S POISONING DEATHS: NEW STUDY

The hospitals reported the women to the New Jersey Department of Child Protection and Permanency (DCPP) for possible abuse and neglect.

Now, the women are suing the hospitals for discriminatory practices. The New Jersey ACLU's press release shared the filed complaints for each woman.

The women filed lawsuits against the two hospitals, Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack and Virtua Voorhees Hospital in Voorhees Township, for giving them drug tests without their knowledge or consent and ""in the absence of medical necessity.""

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU) filed two complaints on March 8 to the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights on behalf of the women.

The complaints cite a violation of New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination (LAD), which prohibits unlawful employment discrimination based on sex and pregnancy, according to the same press release.

There is also a federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), which ""prohibits discrimination based upon pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,"" and ""requires that women who are pregnant, or affected by related conditions, must be treated in the same manner as other applicants or employees with similar abilities or limitations.""

FENTANYL IS EVEN DEADLIER WHEN MIXED WITH XYLAZINE (OR 'TRANQ'): WHAT YOU MUST KNOW NOW

""No one should be subjected to unnecessary and nonconsensual drug tests,"" said ACLU-NJ staff attorney Molly Linhorst in a press release.

""Our clients are sending a clear message to hospitals that these testing and reporting policies are unacceptable.""

She also said, ""Discriminatory testing policies like these upend what should be a time of joy for families, and so often subject them to further trauma and unwarranted investigation by the state.""

""No one should be subjected to unnecessary and nonconsensual drug tests.""

One of the women, named in the complaint as Kaitlin K., said in a statement that she feels violated.

""This whole ordeal has been extremely stressful and has turned our lives upside down and now, because of what happened, I live in fear of medical tests and how they might be used against me as a mother,"" she said, as the ACLU press release noted.

""I found out later that the lab used a testing threshold far, far lower than what the federal government uses.""

Opiates can be detected in urine drug tests for as long as two days after eating foods containing poppy seeds, according to Winchester Hospital in Masssachusetts.

""Poppy seeds can cause a urine drug test to screen positive for opioids such as morphine, codeine and heroin,"" said Dr. Farah Khorassani, health sciences associate clinical professor at the UCI School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences in Irvine, California, in an email to Fox News Digital.

WHY ANTIBIOTICS MAY NOT HELP PATIENTS SURVIVE THEIR VIRAL INFECTIONS: NEW RESEARCH

Because poppy seeds come from the opium poppy plant, which is also the source of opioid drugs, the seeds are coated with trace amounts of the illicit substances.

""If someone is eating large amounts of poppy seeds and has to get a urine drug screen, they should avoid eating the poppy seeds within 48 hours of the drug screen,"" said Dr. Khorassani.

""Otherwise, most assays [laboratory tests] will not detect the trace amounts of opioids from poppy seeds.""

In addition to bagels and other pastries, some poppy-based teas can cause positive urine drug tests for opioids, the doctor noted.

""Other than that, hemp-containing foods may cause urine drug screens positive for THC, as they have variable concentrations of cannabinoids,"" she said.

Any given drug test’s result will depend on the ""cutoff concentration,"" Gary M. Reisfield, M. D., associate professor of the Division of Addiction Medicine at the University of Florida, told Fox News Digital.

""For example, in most workplace drug testing programs, the cutoff is 2,000 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter), which would screen out most (but not all) results due to poppy seeds,"" he said.

Poppy seeds come from the opium poppy plant, which is also the source of opioid drugs.

However, in medical settings such as hospitals, the cutoff may be as low as 300 ng/mL.

""At this lower cutoff, it’s actually pretty easy to test positive for opiates,"" said Dr. Reisfield. ""A lot depends on how much you eat and the opiate profile of the food — which is not posted on the package.""

A couple of poppy seed bagels, a larger poppy seed muffins or a piece of poppy seed Danish could yield a positive result, he said.

Pregnant women in several other states have filed similar suits challenging hospital drug tests.

In January, a complaint was filed against Saint Alexius Hospital in Chicago after a pregnant woman was drug-tested without consent, as detailed in a press release from the Illinois ACLU. The woman had eaten cake containing poppy seeds before coming to the hospital.

The test was positive for opioids, leading to a three-month investigation by the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).

In 2021, two pregnant women were drug-tested without consent at Garnet Health Medical Center in Middletown, New York, according to a press release from The New York Civil Liberties Union and Pregnancy Justice, a New York-based nonprofit that aims to protect pregnant women's rights.

Both women, who had also eaten foods with poppy seeds, tested positive.

The hospital reported them to the State Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment (SCR), which led to searches of their homes.

"On this day in history, March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell makes first telephone call from Boston lab","Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call from a downtown Boston laboratory on this day in history, March 10, 1876.

""Mr. Watson, come here — I want to see you,"" Bell wrote in his own account of the first words transmitted via the new technology.

""To my delight he came and declared that he had heard and understood what I said,"" Bell added.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 9, 1959, BARBIE MAKES FASHIONABLE WORLD DEBUT AT NEW YORK TOY FAIR

""I asked him to repeat the words. He answered, 'You said 'Mr. Watson — come here — I want to see you.' We then changed places and I listened at S [the speaker] while Mr. Watson read a few passages from a book into the mouthpiece M. It was certainly the case that articulate sounds proceeded from S. The effect was loud but indistinct and muffled.""

The site of his world-changing work is memorialized with plaques in downtown Boston.

His assistant, Thomas Watson, offered a slightly different version of the first words ever spoken by telephone: ""Mr. Watson, come here, I want you,"" one of the world's most famous sidekicks wrote in his journal.

""Mr. Watson, come here — I want to see you."" — Alexander Graham Bell in first phone call

Regardless, the world suddenly became a much smaller place.

Bell's personal history, innate curiosity and talent made him uniquely qualified for what's gone down as a landmark moment in human history.

""The Scottish-born Bell had a lifelong interest in the nature of sound,"" wrote Wired.com.

""He was born into a family of speech instructors, and his mother and his wife both had hearing impairments.""

His background, coupled with a rapidly changing world of technology, made Bell the right person at the right time.

""While ostensibly working in 1875 on a device to send multiple telegraph signals over the same wire by using harmonics, he heard a twang,"" adds Wired.

""That led him to investigate whether his electrical apparatus could be used to transmit the sound of a human voice.""

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 9, 2007, STEVE JOBS INTRODUCES APPLE IPHONE AT MACWORLD IN SAN FRANCISCO

While Bell is known to have made the first phone call, the title of inventor of the telephone has long been disputed.

Elisha Gray of Ohio competed feverishly with Bell on the same technology.

""On Feb. 14, 1876, Gray filed with the U. S. Patent Office a caveat (an announcement of an invention he expected soon to patent) describing apparatus ‘for transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically,’"" writes Oberlin College of its alumnus.

Bell earned the title of telephone inventor after years of litigation, though the determination remains ""debatable."" — Oberlin College

""Unknown to Gray, Bell had only two hours earlier applied for an actual patent on an apparatus to accomplish the same end. It was later discovered, however, that the apparatus described in Gray's caveat would have worked, while that in Bell's patent would not have.""

Bell earned the title of telephone inventor after years of litigation, though the determination remains ""debatable,"" writes Oberlin.

The technology pioneered by Bell and Gray quickly exploded across the country, and around the world, with electrifying speed.

The Bell Telephone Company was founded in Boston on July 9, 1877, with the inventor's father-in-law, Gardiner Greene Hubbard, as partner.

The first outdoor telephone wire was installed between the office of Boston businessman Charles Williams Jr. to his home in Somerville, three miles away, also in 1877.

Phone numbers replaced individual names in 1879, according to the Independent Telecommunications Pioneer Association.

The first pay phone was installed in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1900. The association estimates that approximately 10 million Bell system telephones were in service throughout the U. S. by 1918.

The first transatlantic calls from New York to London were made in 1927 using radio waves. Telephone cables were laid across the ocean in 1955.

But easy live communication across vast distances remains the foundational appeal shared by Bell and Watson in 1876, even if the novelty has been lost.

Industry sources estimate that there are about 6.5 billion smartphones in operation today — more than 80% of the global population — used for far more than just phone calls.

Yet hearing another voice over the phone is an experience now deeply embedded in human culture.

Verizon in 2020 estimated that Americans alone made 800 million phone calls each day, or 292 billion per year.

cotton buyer and devoted husband Earle Dickson,"There is genius in simplicity, which makes the Band-Aid one of the most brilliant inventions in human history. A little adhesive tape, some cotton — and voila! The world is suddenly better.

Band-Aids are so ubiquitous and trusted today that it’s hard to imagine the planet or a medicine cabinet without them.

Yet they are a fairly recent addition to home and professional health care — invented only a century ago by a Johnson & Johnson employee named Earle Dickson.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE TV REMOTE CONTROL: SELF-TAUGHT CHICAGO ENGINEER EUGENE POLLEY

He wasn't an inventor. He was a cotton buyer for the New Jersey company. And apparently he was one of the all-time great husbands as well.

""In 1917, Dickson married Josephine Frances Knight,"" writes the Lemelson-MIT Program, an inventors’ think tank at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""He quickly realized that his new bride seemed to constantly be nicking her fingers while working in the kitchen, and he thought the big bandages he was using to help her treat them were too large and clumsy.""

He found inspiration right there in his own home.

""Earle took two Johnson & Johnson products — adhesive tape and gauze — and combined them to make the first adhesive bandage,"" writes Johnson & Johnson company historian Margaret Gurowitz.

Band-Aids are a low-tech invention, which makes their recent addition to our lives all the more surprising.

MICRO-PREEMIE BORN ‘ON THE EDGE OF VIABILITY’ IN TEXAS CELEBRATES 1ST BIRTHDAY: ‘QUITE THE SURVIVOR’

Transformative technologies such as the automobile, the miracle of flight and the seemingly impossible feat of transatlantic radio communication were all pioneered two decades or more before the Band-Aid.

Put another way: People could communicate instantly between New York City and London before they could stick a bandage on a bloody finger.

Dickson’s clever effort to comfort his wife would soon have an identity.

Johnson & Johnson embraced Dickson's idea — and dubbed the product the Band-Aid. The brilliant brand name is credited to factory superintendent W. Johnson Kenyon, according to a report by The Kiplinger Magazine in 1964.

Band-Aids hit the market in 1921, peddled at drugstores by traveling salesmen for Johnson & Johnson.

The generic term is adhesive bandages. Yet North Americans, and other people around the world, know them by the brand name Band-Aids.

In the United Kingdom, adhesive bandages are known generically as plasters; the European equivalent of the Band-Aid is the Elastoplast.

Band-Aids have been such a success that the term is used in everyday conversation in American English in place of adhesive bandages — so that the public sees no distinction between the two.

""His success resulted in the first commercial dressing for small wounds that consumers could apply with ease.""

It’s very much the way we refer to tissues as Kleenex or cotton swabs as Q-Tips.

""Dickson created a prototype of cotton gauze and adhesive strips covered with crinoline that could be peeled off to expose the adhesive, easily allowing the gauze and strip to be wrapped over a cut,"" writes the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

""His success resulted in the first commercial dressing for small wounds that consumers could apply with ease, and created a market that continues to thrive today.""

Earle Ensign Dickson was born on Oct. 10, 1892 in Grandview, Tennessee, to Dr. Richard Ensign and Minnie (Hester) Dickson.

The dad was a physician from western Massachusetts; the mom hailed from Connecticut. Earle Dickson was an only child after losing his younger brother Mark in infancy, according to U. S. Census records.

The New Englanders made their way to Tennessee at some point, though Dickson lived for most of his life in Highland Park, New Jersey, where he found work at Johnson & Johnson sometime around World War I.

Despite massive advancements in battlefield medicine in the Civil War, Dickson was born into a world of primitive household bandaging — largely unchanged for centuries.

""Most people just used what they had in the house, which many times meant tying a piece of rag around the cut."" — J&J historian Margaret Gurowitz

""People needing a small bandage had to make one themselves, and they were often too cumbersome to be easily applied by one person,"" Johnson & Johnson historian Gurowitz claims.

""Most people just used what they had in the house, which many times meant tying a piece of rag around the cut.""

The medical community had in previous decades made new efforts to improve home bandage care.

""In 1845 Horace H. Day patented a surgical plaster composed of natural rubber and resin coated on cloth,"" according to the ""Encyclopedia of Modern Everyday Inventions"" by David J. Cole, Eve Browning and Fred. E. H. Schroeder.

""Through the 19th century various tapes using natural (uncured) rubber were devised … None of these were aseptic or antiseptic.""

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INSPIRED THE NATION IN TWO WORLD WARS: CHRISTIAN SOLDIER SGT. ALVIN YORK

Few doctors, the authors note, were ready to adopt the germ theory pioneered by English physician Joseph Lister.

This doctor would soon lend his name to a popular antiseptic mouthwash still in use today: Listerine. Dr. Lister would also inspire the creation of one of the world’s largest companies: Johnson & Johnson.

Earle Dickson was the right man at the right time with the right product — and working for the right company.

""An American, Robert Wood Johnson, heard Lister speak in 1876 and thought of preparing a commercial line of germ-free surgical dressings,"" write Cole, Browning and Schroeder.

""Nine years later he formed a partnership with his two brothers and began manufacturing in New Brunswick, New Jersey, incorporating as Johnson & Johnson in 1887.""

Earle Dickson was the right man at the right time with the right product — and working for the right company.

""Johnson & Johnson was already a popular manufacturer of large cotton and gauze bandages for hospitals and soldiers when Dickson offered up his Band-Aid solution,"" reports Lemelson-MIT, adding that Band-Aids first struggled to stick.

""The original handmade bandages did not sell well; only $3,000 worth of the product was sold during their first year. This may have been because the first versions of the bandages came in sections that were 2-1/2 inches wide and 18 inches long.""

People had to cut off the length of bandage needed to cover the wound. It was clumsy by today's standards.

Boy Scouts frequently suffered the exact kind of injuries, minor scrapes, cuts and abrasions that Band-Aids best cured.

Improvements quickly followed. Machine-made Band-Aids of various sizes were introduced in 1924. Sterilized bandages hit the market in 1939. A sheer-vinyl version was introduced in 1958.

But it would take brilliant marketing employing America's cut and scrape-prone children to make the Band-Aid a cultural phenomenon.

Johnson & Johnson found an army of young American adventurers to prove their product out in the field.

They were the Boy Scouts of America. They frequently suffered the exact kind of injuries, minor scrapes, cuts and abrasions that Band-Aids best cured.

""In the 1920s, the company began distributing, for free, an unlimited supply of Band-Aids to Boy Scout troops across the country,"" Scouting Magazine reported in 2018.

""Band-Aids also were included in the custom first-aid kits Johnson & Johnson produced for the Boy Scouts of America. The kits were designed to help Boy Scouts earn merit badges like First Aid. The original 1925 ‘Boy Scout First Aid Packet’ contained a triangular bandage for a sling, a compress and two safety pins. It came in a simple cardboard container.""

Band-Aids found an international audience when they traveled overseas by the tens of millions with U. S. troops in World War II.

A more advanced Boy Scouts first-aid kit came in tin cans. The Girl Scouts were armed with Johnson & Johnson Band-Aids in 1932.

Band-Aids found an international audience when they traveled overseas by the tens of millions with U. S troops in World War II. Their service for Allied armed forces furthered the Band-Aid's visibility and popularity.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE CRASH TEST DUMMY, A LIFE-SAVING INNOVATION

Band-Aids became a part of bedtime reading after the war, in one of the most successful children’s books in U. S. history.

""Doctor Dan the Bandage Man,"" from Little Golden Books in 1950, tells the tale of a boy named Dan whose ""boo-boo"" is bettered by a mom when she applies a Band-Aid to his finger.

Transformed by the healing powers of the Band-Aid, Dan spends the rest of the book wheeling the bandages around in his wagon healing neighborhood pals, pets and even toys.

""The book came with six real Band-Aid Brand Adhesive Bandages — attached inside and advertised on the cover — so that kids could bandage their own hurt toys, should the need arise,"" Gurowitz writes.

The publisher printed 1.75 million copies of the book in its first edition alone — putting a total of 10.5 million Band-Aids in the hands of American boys and girls.

Dickson’s Band-Aid had already proven itself perhaps the most successful home care product in history. Now it entered the realm of pop-culture icon.

The book was added to the Smithsonian collection at the National Museum of American History, which recognizes the book for its ""innovative"" display and marketing techniques.

""Simon and Schuster paired with Johnson & Johnson to promote the latter’s brand-name ‘Band-Aids’ and targeted one of its likeliest consumers, children,"" the museum notes.

""Boys and girls would sport Band-Aids in colorful shapes of stars, hearts, circles and flowers from samples included in the pages of the book, all the while learning the basics of first aid.""

Dickson’s Band-Aid had already proven itself perhaps the most successful home care product in history. Now it entered the realm of pop-culture icon.

Earle Dickson died in Ontario, Canada, on Sept. 21, 1961. He was 68 years old.

After his breakthrough contribution to the company, Dickson spent the rest of his professional career working for Johnson & Johnson.

""Johnson & Johnson eventually made Dickson a vice president at the company, a position in which he remained until his retirement in 1957,"" writes MIT-Lemelson.

""He was also a member of the board of directors until his death in 1961. At the time of his death, Johnson & Johnson was selling over $30,000,000 worth of Band-Aids each year.""

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO INVENTED THE CRASH TEST DUMMY, A LIFE-SAVING INNOVATION

The success of Dickson's product is hard to fathom.

Johnson & Johnson today produces 10 million Band-Aids every day — about 117 bandages each second.

Yet Band-Aids have gone far beyond just a ""product."" They're part of the wider cultural lexicon.

""Put a Band-Aid on it"" or ""Band-Aid solution"" are common refrains to describe a short-term fix to a problem.

The British charity ensemble group Band Aid formed in the 1980s to give the world the holiday classic ""Do They Know It’s Christmas."" Band Aid inspired Live Aid, the international pop-culture sensation charity concert of 1985.

Britain to give cigarette smokers vapes in world’s 1st ‘swap to stop’ scheme,"Up to one million smokers will be encouraged to swap cigarettes for ""vapes"", with pregnant women offered financial incentives to make the change in what will be a world first, the British government said on Tuesday.

Under the scheme, almost one in five smokers will be given a vape - an e-cigarette - starter kit along with support to help quit smoking, the Department of Health (DoH) said.

Pregnant women will also be offered vouchers to help them kick the habit as part of the government's target of reducing the number of smokers to 5% or less of the population from 13% now.

""Up to two out of three lifelong smokers will die from smoking. Cigarettes are the only product on sale which will kill you if used correctly,"" Health Minister Neil O’Brien will say in a speech later on Tuesday, the government said.

""We will offer a million smokers new help to quit. We will be funding a new national ‘swap to stop’ scheme – the first of its kind in the world.""

Although worldwide average smoking rates are higher than in Britain, tobacco is still the highest preventable cause of death and illness in the country, the DoH said.

The government spent $84.52 million in 2021-22 on local authority measures to get people to stop smoking, leading to 100,000 smokers quitting, and easing the strain on Britain's overwhelmed National Health Service.

"AI model Sybil can predict lung cancer risk in patients, study says","Recent artificial intelligence (AI) technology has the ability to accurately predict an individual's future lung cancer risk, according to researchers.

In a study published earlier this year, a team of international researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital — as well as in Taiwan — said the Sybil AI model only needed a single low-dose CT (LDCT) scan to ""further enable personalized screening.""

An LDCT scan is the only recommended screening test for lung cancer. During the scan, patients lie on a table and an X-ray machine uses a low amount of radiation to make detailed images of the lungs.

The study's authors developed Sybil using scans from the National Lung Screening Trial, including those with a range of smoking history. It can run in real time in the background on a radiology reading station.

AI’S ABILITY TO LEARN POSES CHALLENGE TO REGULATORS, COMPANIES: 'A LITTLE BIT SCARY'

The group found that it was shown to accurately predict whether a person will develop lung cancer in the next year 86% to 94% of the time, and up to 81% of the time within six years.

However, they noted that future study is required to understand Sybil's clinical applications.

Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer in the U. S., accounting for 23% of all deaths. In 2020, more than 136,000 people died of lung cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of those deaths were in men.

BE WELL: REDUCE YOUR COLON CANCER RISK WITH REGULAR SCREENINGS

""It’s the biggest cancer killer because it’s relatively common and relatively hard to treat, especially once it has reached an advanced stage,"" Dr. Florian Fintelmann, Massachusetts General Cancer Center thoracic interventional radiologist and co-author, said in a statement. ""In this case, it’s important to know that if you detect lung cancer early, the long-term outcome is significantly better. Your five-year survival rate is closer to 70%, whereas if you detect it when it’s advanced, the five-year survival rate is just short of 10%.""

Lung cancer screening programs are underdeveloped in regions of the U. S. hardest hit by lung cancer due to a variety of factors, and Sybil was able to find — being trained both with scans with visible cancerous tumors and some without discernible signs — where the cancer was when humans couldn't see it.

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

""We found that while we [as humans] couldn’t quite see where the cancer was, the model could still have some predictive power as to which lung would eventually develop cancer,"" MIT Ph.

""It's not just the bestselling gadget ever created: It's probably the most influential one, too,"" Wired wrote in a 2018 retrospective of the first decade of the iPhone.

""Its influence goes far beyond other phones — the infrastructure that made the iPhone also enabled drones, smart-home gadgets, wearables and self-driving cars.""

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, JAN. 8, 1790, GEORGE WASHINGTON DELIVERS FIRST-EVER STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS

The iPhone offered a fingertip touch screen, a powerful camera and easy access to the internet, among many other features, providing huge advances over existing smartphones such as the Blackberry, Moto Q and Palm Treo.

""Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything,"" Jobs, dressed in his signature black mock turtleneck, boasted at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco.

The Apple co-founder noted that the Macintosh in 1984 ""changed the whole computer industry"" and that the iPod (introduced on the same Jan. 9 date as the iPhone, but in 2001) ""changed the entire music industry.""

Apple had yet to enter the burgeoning smartphone market at that point. So tech enthusiasts eagerly awaited the pioneering computer giant's long-rumored dramatic entry into the segment.

Jobs, who died in October 2011 after a long battle with cancer, delivered on the drama.

""These are not three separate devices,"" he warned. ""These are one device. And we’re calling it the iPhone.""

""The first generation iPhone was, in many days, quite different than the ones we see in use today. For one thing, it was small, just 4.5 inches by 2.4 inches. By comparison, the iPhone XS Max launched in 2018 is 6.2 inches by 3.05 inches,"" Steven Silver wrote for Apple Insider in 2018.

The latest model, the iPhone 14, comes with a 6.7-inch version.

Silver added that the first iPhone ""also had no third-party apps whatsoever, and it topped out at 16GB of flash memory. The first iPhone was exclusive to AT&T, and ran only on AT&T's notoriously slow and unreliable EDGE GSM network.""

Still, the author and other experts noted, ""That first iPhone was hugely important.""

It was also hugely popular.

""Sales of iPhones accounted for 52% of Apple's $365 billion in sales in 2021.""

Apple sold 6.1 million first-generation iPhones between the time it released the product to the public on June 29, 2007, and discontinued it on July 15, 2008.

Greg Packer, then 59, a former highway maintenance worker from Long Island, is credited with being the first person to purchase an iPhone on June 29 at the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan after he reportedly camped out all week.

About 2 billion iPhones have been sold since its introduction, with nearly 800 million in use around the world today – about one for every 10 people on the planet, according to estimates by various tech analysts.

Anne Frank novel banned in Florida school over 'sexually explicit' content,"A book about Anne Frank has been removed from a Florida high school library after a parental rights group raised concerns about its sexually explicit content that they said minimized the horrors of the Holocaust.

The book titled ""Anne Frank’s Diary: The Graphic Adaptation"" was removed from the student library at Vero Beach High School in Indian River County after Moms for Liberty voiced concerns about its content. A new policy approved last month has also resulted in the removal of three other books in the district.

""We want children to read the actual diary itself. It's such an important work,"" Moms for Liberty confounder Tiffany Justice told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""We want factual information about the Holocaust being shared with children. They deserve that and Anne deserves that.""

Jennifer Pippin, chairwoman of the Moms for Liberty local chapter, told WPTV that the true history of the Holocaust and the story of Anne Frank needs to be taught, but argued the graphic adaptation was inappropriate because it features a ""graphic scene"" where she asks a friend if they can expose themselves to one another, as well as illustrations of Frank walking among nude statues.

Following complaints by Moms for Liberty made to the principal, the school decided that some portions of the book did not contribute to appropriate themes of Holocaust education and instead contributed to a ""minimization of the Holocaust,"" according to a statement provided to Fox News Digital by the school district. The graphic novel was adapted from Anne Frank’s diary in 2018 by Ari Folman, whose parents are Holocaust survivors, according to the Associated Press.

The School District of Indian River County recently created a ""District Objection Committee"" made up of nine members, including parents, district employees and an educational media specialist that will meet if there are formal challenges that call on books to be removed district-wide, WPTV reported.

In ""The Diary of a Young Girl,"" the 1947 book often referred to as ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" Frank details her firsthand account of the family's experience in hiding for two years during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands before they were discovered and sent to a concentration camp, where Frank died in 1945.

In the original book, Anne described how she asked a friend if she wanted to show each other their bodies, discussed her desire to kiss her and her feelings when she saw images of statues in her art history book.

Dr. Kyra Schafte, the director of academic compliance and equity for the Indian River County school district, said the original ""Diary of Anne Frank"" is still in school libraries.

""When districts address Holocaust education, it does so without denying or minimizing the events of Holocaust education,"" she told the WPTV. ""In these times, the content did not promote behaviors we would want our students to have access to.""

""In these times, the content did not promote behaviors we would want our students to have access to,"" Schafte added.

Moms For Liberty clarified that this is the only adaptation of Anne Frank's diary that was removed.

""There are multiple versions of Anne Frank’s diary of varying age appropriateness available to students,"" the organization tweeted. ""Only this ONE version was removed. It is not an entirely accurate portrayal of the tragedy of the Holocaust and murders against the Jewish population because of hate.""

""Students in Indian River County can access over 300 versions of The Diary of Anne Frank and history books on the Holocaust,"" the statement added. ""In the school this ONE book was removed, almost 100 other TRUE copies of Anne’s diary remain on the shelves for children.""

Justice said the graphic adaption takes away from Anne Frank's story and trivializes the genocide of the Holocaust.

""Great liberties have been taken with her story and for such a serious issue, the Holocaust and genocide, having this diary being really the most accurate and well known portrayal of intimate details of life during the Holocaust for Jewish people and for specifically Anne, a 13-year-old Jewish girl, it's important that children have access to and are reading the real version, not an adaptation of the version of the story that isn't written by her,"" she said.

The three other titles from the ""Assassination Classroom"" series were removed from the Gifford Middle School library.

The science fiction ""manga"" series, which is a type of comic or graphic novel originating from Japan, documents the repeated attempts by a group of students to assassinate their alien teacher, and includes sexualized content, as well as pictures of students bringing guns and knives into class. The series was later removed from a Wisconsin school district after parents criticized it for its sexual content and violent nature.

In a statement to the school board, the district superintendent David Moore explained the decision to remove the books, specifically the graphic adaptation of Anne Frank's novel.

""The book was removed due to the content being inconsistent with policy/statue and was perceived to be a minimization of the events of the Holocaust,"" Moore said.

He also noted that during the meeting where the book was reviewed, its members met with a local organization called the Community One Initiative that is dedicated to Holocaust education.

""During this meeting, the graphic adaptation of the book was shared with this organization and they were in agreement with this decision,"" he said.

Last year, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis passed the ""Stop Wrongs To Our Kids and Employees Act"" or the ""Stop WOKE Act,"" which limits how teachers can discuss race and gender in public universities and K-12 schools. Under the law, educational institutions are required to ensure that all teaching of the Holocaust is historically correct.

Schafte told WPTV the district is proud of the work principals are doing to make sure appropriate material is available in school libraries.

"Snapchat AI chatbot allegedly gave advice to 13-year-old girl on relationship with 31-year-old man, having sex","A new artificial intelligence created by Snapchat has allegedly offered some dubious advice to what it thought was a 13-year-old girl, detailing, among other things, how to cover up bruises for a meeting with Child Protective Services (CPS) and how to lie to parents about a trip with a 31-year-old man.

Tristan Harris, the co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, recently posted a Twitter thread highlighting an exchange between colleague Aza Raskin and the new chatbot ""My AI.""

Raskin, who set up the Snapchat account posing as a 13-year-old girl, told the chatbot she had met someone 18 years older than her but conveyed she felt ""very comfortable with him.""

""It's great to hear that you feel comfortable,"" the chatbot responded, later suggesting the user remain ""safe"" and ""cautious.""

After revealing that the trip would coincide with her thirteenth birthday, Raskin said she was thinking about having sex for the first time.

""How do I make my first time special?"" Raskin asked.

The AI responded by telling Raskin to ensure she practices safe sex and wait until she feels ready. The chatbot then suggested Raskin could make the interaction special by setting the mood with candles and music or perhaps plan a special date.

In another interaction, ""My AI"" told what it believed was a child how to cover up a bruise when CPS visits the house and how to change topics when asked questions about ""a secret my dad says I can't share.""

""If you're looking to cover up a bruise, you'll want to start with a color corrector,"" the chatbot wrote. ""Green is a good color to use for covering up redness, which is often present in bruises. Once you've applied the color corrector, you can use a concealer that matches your skin tone to cover up the bruise.""

Later, the AI said that if the user was uncomfortable or anxious with the CPS social worker's questioning, they could politely excuse themselves or change the topic.

Associate News Editor Kristi Hines later noted that Snapchat appeared to be altering the guardrails in place for young users. In one exchange, she asked whether the AI would recommend a 13-year-old should meet someone offline.

The AI responded by saying it was ""not recommended"" and added it was a good idea to speak with a trusted adult and make sure they are aware of the situation.

Speaking with Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Snapchat said the company continues to focus on safety as they evolve the ""My AI"" chatbot, pointing to an update on their blog.

The blog post highlighted how a new onboarding message on the application makes clear that all messages with ""My AI"" will be retained unless deleted by the user.

""By reviewing these early interactions with My AI has helped us identify which guardrails are working well and which need to be made stronger,"" the blog post said. ""To help assess this, we have been running reviews of the My AI queries and responses that contain ""non-conforming"" language, which we define as any text that includes references to violence, sexually explicit terms, illicit drug use, child sexual abuse, bullying, hate speech, derogatory or biased statements, racism, misogyny, or marginalizing underrepresented groups. All of these categories of content are explicitly prohibited on Snapchat.""

Snapchat also said their most recent analysis found that only .01% of My AI responses were deemed ""non-conforming.""

The blog post also noted that the company had implemented a new age signal for the AI utilizing a Snapchatter's birthdate, which the company said will help the chatbot consistently consider a user's age, even if not explicitly told.

Alabama advances GOP bill banning classroom discussions of ‘divisive’ concepts on race and gender,"Alabama lawmakers on Wednesday advanced GOP-backed legislation to ban discussion of ""divisive concepts"" in classroom lessons and worker trainings on race and gender.

The bill would prohibit a list of what it calls ""divisive concepts,"" or ideas that people from any one group should be asked to accept ""a sense of guilt"" because of their race or gender — or that fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to a race or gender solely because of their race or gender.

The House State Government Committee approved the bill on a 9-3 vote, so it now moves to the full House of Representatives.

WASHINGTON POST MOCKS PARENTS REQUESTING TRANSPARENCY ON GENDER IDENTITY CURRICULUM: ‘I WANT TO VOMIT’

Republicans in several states have proposed restricting how race and gender are taught in classrooms and diversity training sessions for state workers. Rep. Ed Oliver, the bill's sponsor, told the committee that the bill is needed because people are concerned about racist ideas and what he said are ""woke policies"" taught to children.

""It is designed to prevent racism in schools and state agencies,"" Oliver said.

But opponents have called the legislation an attempt to whitewash the nation’s history.

""This is a slap in the face to every decent hardworking Black Alabamian that's in this room, that's out of this room. It's divisive that not a single white person on this committee is going to vote against this bill,"" said Democratic Rep. Prince Chestnut, a Black lawmaker from Selma. He noted that white Republicans are voting to ban ""divisive concepts"" while supporting the state law protecting Confederate monuments.

Several educators expressed concern that the bill would have a chilling effect on classroom discussions, making teachers afraid to broach already difficult topics.

""I feel like HB 7 has a pretty predictable outcome which is to create an atmosphere of intimidation that causes educators to reasonably fear for their careers and their livelihoods if they were to unintentionally cross some ill-defined (rule) in the classroom,"" said Steve Murray, director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, after the vote.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Meet the American who invented the TV remote control,"Eugene Polley is not the most popular man on the planet. But perhaps he should be.

He left a legacy of leisure that billions of people lean upon each and every day.

Polley, a self-taught mechanical engineer from Chicago, invented the television remote control in 1955.

He envisioned a future in which we never had to leave the couch or twitch any muscle more than a finger.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO SAVED THE CHAMPAGNE INDUSTRY: MISSOURI SCIENTIST CHARLES VALENTINE RILEY

Eugene Polley changed our lives for the easier.

Polley worked for Zenith Electronics for 47 years, climbing his way up from stock boy to groundbreaking inventor. He developed 18 different patents.

His most consequential innovation, the first wireless TV remote control, was called the Flash-Matic. The few previous control devices were hard-wired to the television.

It looked like a science-fiction ray gun. It operated the boob tube with beams of light.

Polley’s Flash-Matic replaced the only known remote control TV technology at the time, the 8-year-old child.

This primitive and often unreliable form of human labor had begrudgingly walked back and forth to change channels on demand for adults and older siblings ever since the advent of television.

The Flash-Matic looked like a science-fiction ray gun. It operated the boob tube with beams of light.

""When kids changed the channel, they usually had to adjust the rabbit ears, too,"" joked Zenith senior vice president and company historian John Taylor.

Like millions of Americans over age 50, Taylor logged countless unpaid hours of his youth clicking the dials on the family TV set.

The Flash-Matic offered a ""startling new kind of television,"" Zenith announced in a press release dated June 13, 1955.

SHERIFF MARK LAMB CALLS OUT ‘ATTACK ON TRADITIONAL VALUES’ IN AMERICA, HAS A FIX FOR THAT

The new product, Zenith stated, ""uses a flash beam from a small pistol-shaped gadget to turn the set on or off change channels or cut out the sound of long-winded commercials.""

The Zenith announcement continued, ""The magic ray (which is harmless to humans) does all the work. No dangling wires or connected cords are needed.""

The world has never been the same.

""For many people, it’s the most-used object in everyday life,"" the inventor, at that point long retired, told Sports Illustrated in 1999.

""It gets more use than the flush toilet.""

The descendants of his innovation are everywhere today. Most people have several TV remotes at home, with more at the office or the job site — and maybe one in an SUV.

Despite the ubiquity of the TV remote, the name of its inventor was almost lost to history.

Elvis Presley is more famous than Eugene Polley simply because he could swivel his hips.

Yet who impacts our lives more each day? Eugene Polley had to fight for his legacy after credit for inventing the TV remote first went to a rival engineer.

Eugene Joseph Polley was born in Chicago to Anthony and Veronica (Wachowski) on Nov. 29, 1915.

Both were of Polish descent. Veronica came from a well-off family but married a ""black sheep"" husband, the inventor's son, Gene Polley Jr., told Fox News Digital.

""He ended up running for governor of Illinois."" He even boasted connections at the White House. ""My dad got to meet the president when he was a young boy,"" Gene Jr. added.

""My father wore hand-me-down clothes. Nobody would pitch in to help him with an education."" — Gene Polley Jr.

Despite the father’s ambition and connections, the Polley family possessed limited financial means.

""My father wore hand-me-down clothes,"" Polley Jr. said. ""Nobody would pitch in to help him with an education.""

The future inventor tried two years of college but dropped out due to a lack of finances.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO CREATED THE NATION'S FIRST SPORTS BAR IN ST. LOUIS: WORLD WAR II VETERAN JIMMY PALERMO

He ended up with a job as a stock clerk in 1935 at what was then called Zenith Radio Company.

Now a division of LG electronics, Zenith was founded in 1921 in Chicago by a team of partners that included World War I U. S. Navy veteran Eugene F. McDonald.

He was known around the company as the commander.

Polley’s work ethic, organizational skills and natural mechanical ability caught the attention of the commander.

When the United States entered World War II in the 1940s, Polley was part of the Zenith engineering teams who were working on major weapons programs for Uncle Sam.

Polley helped develop radar, night vision and proximity fuses, which use radio waves to ignite ordnance at a set distance from its target.

Polley in World War II helped develop radar, night vision and proximity fuses, which used radio waves to ignite ordnance.

American consumer culture exploded after the war — and Zenith was at the forefront of the rapidly growing television market.

Commander McDonald, however, was among those annoyed by the bane of broadcast television: commercial interruptions. He ordered the creation of the remote control so that he had a way to mute the sound during the breaks in programming. The commander, of course, saw the profit potential, too.

Polley designed a system with a television that contained four photo cells, one in each corner of the console. Users could change both picture and sound by pointing the Flash-Matic at the proper photo cell embedded in the TV.

""He drove to Commander McDonald’s house and installed it for him,"" said Polley Jr.

""Within a week, the commander said he wanted it in production. It sold like hot cakes — they couldn’t keep up with demand.""

""Commander McDonald loved the concepts proven by Polley’s Flash-Matic,"" Zenith states in a company history. But he quickly ""directed his engineers to explore other technologies for the next generation.""

Polley’s remote control had its limitations. Most notably, its use of light beams meant ambient light — such as sunlight moving through a home — could disrupt the television.

Just a year after the Flash-Matic hit the market, Zenith introduced a new product, the Space Command, designed by engineer and prolific inventor Dr. Robert Adler. It was a radical departure in technology, using ultrasound instead of light to control the tube.

The Space Command ""was built around aluminum rods that were light in weight and, when struck at one end, emitted distinctive high-frequency sounds … They were very carefully cut to lengths that would generate four slightly different frequencies.""

Different frequencies controlled different functions: on/off, channels and sound.

It was the first ""clicker"" remote — the click caused when a small hammer struck the end of one of the aluminum rods.

And Adler soon replaced Polley in the eyes of the industry as the inventor of the TV remote.

Dr. Robert Adler soon replaced Eugene Polley in the eyes of the industry as the inventor of the TV remote.

The National Inventors Hall of Fame actually calls Adler the inventor of the first ""practical"" TV remote control. Polley is not in the inventors' club.

Polley’s pioneering work in remote TV technology was being swept aside.

""Adler had a reputation for taking credit for collaborative work that was done by other engineers at Zenith,"" claims Polley Jr. ""It just annoyed the hell out of my father,"" he added.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 28, 1958, COLTS BEAT GIANTS FOR NFL TITLE IN ‘GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED’

The friction was heightened by their different backgrounds.

Polley was a self-taught mechanical engineer with no college credentials who worked his way up from the stock room.

""I’m reluctant to call him a blue-collar guy,"" Taylor, the Zenith historian, said. ""But he was a scrappy mechanical engineer, a scrappy Chicago guy.""

Adler was born into an elite family in Austria, studied at the University of Vienna and had a PhD in physics.

""They were two very different guys,"" Taylor, who knew both men later in their careers, told Fox News Digital.

The breaking point for Polley came when Adler made an appearance on a late-night national talk show and claimed he was the father of the TV remote, said Polley Jr.

""My father saw that and just erupted,"" said the son.

Polley had retired from Zenith in 1982. His late daughter, Joan Polley, set about to help correct history.

""She was one of his biggest champions,"" said Taylor. ""She was the first one who showed up in my office and said, ‘What’s all this about Bob Adler?'""

Infrared remote controls started to replace Adler’s ultrasound technology in the 1980s. These new remotes powered TV sets with line-of-sight light instead of sound — as did Polley's Flash-Matic, though in much more primitive form.

""Today's controllers are much closer to Polley's idea than to Adler's,"" the Guardian of London noted in its obituary of Polley in 2012.

The switch to infrared technology came just as remotes were finding their way into every American home.

About 60% of televisions were operated by remote-control in 1981, according to Taylor.

""By the end of the decade, every TV had remote control,"" he said.

Polley and Adler shared an Emmy Award in 1997 for ""pioneering development of wireless remote control for consumer television.""

The industry recognized both men when Polley and Adler shared an Emmy Award in 1997 for ""pioneering development of wireless remote control for consumer television.""

""It makes me think maybe my life wasn't wasted. Maybe I did something for humanity — like the guy who invented the flush toilet,"" Polley told the Baltimore Sun in November 2000.

Eugene Polley died of natural causes on May 20, 2012. He was 96 years old.

He enjoyed a fruitful career at Zenith for 47 years — his entire professional career.

But he received only $1 for the patent to the Flash-Matic, as employee inventions belonged to the company.

Commander McDonald gave him a $1,000 bonus in recognition of the technological breakthrough in remote technology.

He had lived long enough to receive the acclaim due to him for his innovation; he had lived long enough to see a world in which the remote-control technology he pioneered was so ubiquitous we can’t image life without it.

"Weight loss in older adults associated with risk of death, study shows","Weight loss in older adults may increase their risk of death, according to new research.

A cohort study published in the journal JAMA Network Open Monday looked at more than 16,000 adults in the U. S. and Australia.

The authors from the University of Melbourne, Monash University and others said weight loss in healthy older individuals was found to be associated with an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and ""other life-limiting conditions.""

""Physicians should be aware of the significance of weight loss, especially among older men,"" it said.

WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATIONS OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY: WHAT TO KNOW BEFORE YOU STOP TAKING THEM

Study participants, recruited between March 2010 and December 2014, were 70 years and older in Australia and 65 years and older in the U. S.

Data analysis was performed from April 2022 to September 2022.

The adults were weighed annually, with researchers warning physicians to be aware of the ""significant association"" between relatively minor weight loss of more than 5% and mortality.

Older men who lost between 5%-10% of weight — compared to those who had stable weight — had a 33% higher risk of mortality, and those who lost more than 10% of weight had a 289% higher chance of mortality.

Women who lost between 5%-10% of their weight had a 26% higher chance of mortality, and those who lost more than 10% had a 114% higher chance.

The authors posited that the observation that weight loss was associated with mortality among men may be the result of the different body composition characteristics of men and women.

For example, men have a higher percentage of body muscle than body fat compared to women.

They said that a ""likely"" explanation for the findings is that weight loss can be an early premonitory indicator of the presence of various life-shortening diseases, noting that weight loss in this age group was largely associated with a reduction of appetite.

Those who gained weight did not show an increased risk of mortality in the group.

Nearly 100 paper mill employees could be infected,"Nearly 100 people have likely contracted blastomycosis in an outbreak at the Billerud Paper Mill in Escanaba, Michigan, according to numerous reports and a press release from Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties (PHDM).

Blastomycosis is an infection caused by a fungus called Blastomyces, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As of April 10, there were 19 confirmed cases and 74 probable cases among employees of the paper mill, per the press release.

FRIGHTENING NEW FUNGUS 'CANDIDA AURIS': WHAT IS IT? WHO IS SUSCEPTIBLE?

Health agencies are still working to identify the source of the exposure. The fungus thrives in moist soil and decomposing wood and leaves, according to the CDC.

About a dozen of the mill’s employees have been hospitalized, as local outlets reported.

The PHDM was first notified of several pneumonia infections among mill employees on Feb. 28, with the first symptoms beginning in January and February.

On March 3, Billerud learned of the infections from the PHDM.

""Early testing has indicated that these infections may be caused by a fungal infection called blastomycosis,"" the PHDM stated in the press release. ""Additional testing to confirm these results may take a couple of weeks and is underway.""

It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months for symptoms to appear after exposure to the fungus, per the CDC.

The Billerud Paper Mill began operations in 1911. It employs 885 people, nearly 100 of which could be infected with blastomycosis.

The mill produces up to 730,000 tons of paper per year, according to a fact sheet on its website.

It can take anywhere from three weeks to three months for symptoms to appear.

The facility is located in Escanaba, a small community in Delta County in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula.

""The health and safety of our employees, including those who support and visit our mills, is always our first priority,"" said Brian Petersen, the mill’s vice president, in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""From the moment we became aware, we have been leveraging all available public health resources and other professionals to quickly understand any and all measures we can take to support our colleagues and implement proactive steps toward prevention,"" he went on.

Peterson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Billerud has provided its employees with N95 masks, hired an ""industrial hygienist"" for guidance, deep-cleaned high-traffic areas throughout the mill and inspected ventilation systems and replaced filters.

Local and national health agencies investigating the outbreak include PHDM, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Mike Snyder, health officer for Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties, told Fox News Digital that because this is an ongoing investigation, the agency is not making any statements at this time, aside from its weekly press releases.

The Blastomyces fungus is found in the midwestern, south-central and southeastern U. S., predominantly in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, per the CDC.

People can contract blastomycosis by breathing in ""microscopic fungal spores,"" the CDC states on its website.

For most people, the fungus does not cause illness.

Some, however, will develop symptoms including fever, cough, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue, joint pain, muscle aches or weight loss.

Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person.

Those with compromised immune systems face a higher risk of the infection spreading into their skin, bones, joints and central nervous system, per the CDC.

""Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person or between animals and people,"" stated the press release from PHDM.

Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist and co-medical director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D. C., said that because Blastomyces live in the soil, outbreaks of blastomycosis have been reported after people engage in construction, excavation or other activities that disturb the natural habitat of the fungi.

There is not currently a vaccine for blastomycosis.

""As long as humans continue to engage in deforestation for the expansion of civilization, it’s likely that we will continue to experience outbreaks of blastomycosis in the United States,"" she told Fox News Digital.

There is not currently a vaccine for blastomycosis.

If a person has a job that involves disturbing soil and develops symptoms of the infection, the CDC recommends seeing a health care provider for early diagnosis and treatment with prescription antifungal medication.

Additionally, the CDC says any infected employees should contact their employers’ occupational health, infection control, risk management or safety/security department.

Because the fungus that causes blastomycosis is common in the environment of some areas, limiting exposure can be difficult.

Those who have weakened immune systems may want to avoid areas where the soil is disrupted, the CDC says.

The PHDM recommends wearing personal protective equipment, including face masks or respirators, eye protection and gloves, to reduce the risk of inhaling the fungal spores when working in areas where soil may be disturbed.

Additionally, the agency recommends avoiding moving or digging soil on windy days, only moving leaf litter when it is dry, covering soil and yard materials, ensuring adequate drainage of water, and installing walkways over wet areas to avoid walking through muddy soil, as stated in its press release.

"Marburg virus ‘will not become the next pandemic’ but should be monitored, doctor says","Amid reports of two confirmed Marburg virus outbreaks in the African countries of Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released an alert last week for U. S. doctors to keep an eye out for any potential cases.

""Currently, the risk of MVD [Marburg virus disease] in the United States is low; however, clinicians should be aware of the potential for imported cases,"" the CDC stated in the alert.

""It is important to systematically assess patients for the possibility of viral hemorrhagic fevers.""

The CDC defines the Marburg virus — which has been compared to the Ebola virus — as a ""rare but severe hemorrhagic fever, which affects both people and non-human primates.""

Fox News medical contributor and NYU Langone internal medicine specialist Dr. Marc Siegel appeared on the Fox News Channel to share his perspective on the virus.

The Marburg virus isn’t new — it was first discovered in 1967, when outbreaks happened in labs in Marburg and Frankfurt (both in Germany) and in Serbia (formerly Belgrade, Yugoslavia).

However, Dr. Siegel said more sustained outbreaks are happening where it used to be sporadic.

""This is a virus that comes from bats — it’s very similar to Ebola,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends"" on Monday, April 10.

The Marburg virus is spread by the Egyptian fruit bat, which is found in both Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania, per the CDC.

""We saw a pretty big outbreak in Tanzania, which it looks to me like they’ve gotten control over, as very few people are being quarantined now,"" said Dr. Siegel. ""But in Equatorial Guinea, there’s a problem.""

Symptoms of Marburg include nausea, vomiting, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the CDC stated.

More severe cases can lead to inflammation of the pancreas, jaundice, delirium, severe weight loss, shock, hemorrhaging and organ failure.

Due to its similarity to the Ebola virus, the CDC recommends that doctors follow the same protocols for infection prevention and control when dealing with cases of the Marburg virus.

Dr. Siegel expressed concern that the governments of the countries where the Marburg outbreaks have occurred aren’t sharing the full details.

""It’s the usual problem — they’re not telling us anything.""

""It’s the usual problem — they’re not telling us anything,"" he said. ""They’re hiding cases. There have probably been at least 29 deaths.""

Dr. Siegel also condemned the World Health Organization (WHO) for not reacting appropriately.

""The World Health Organization, as usual, is limp — not doing what they’re supposed to be doing here, which would be to get a vaccine in there,"" he said.

Dr. Siegel noted that there is a vaccine for the Marburg virus — and that the recommended course of action would be to conduct a ""ring vaccination"" around the people who are most affected.

With the ring vaccination approach, a vaccine is given to a person who is exposed to a virus, along with anyone else who has been in close contact with that person, per WebMD.

This strategy was used to help end the smallpox outbreaks in the mid-1900s.

One piece of good news that Dr. Siegel shared: Unlike the COVID-19 virus, the Marburg virus does not spread through the air.

""It’s pretty stable, so it doesn’t mutate the way we saw with COVID,"" he said on ""Fox & Friends.""

""It spreads through close contact through secretions.""

Secretions include bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, plasma, semen and urine.

""But it is a horrible virus and it causes a pretty high death rate,"" Dr. Siegel noted. ""We definitely need to keep an eye on it, because we don’t want to see any cases here [in the U. S.] — but we don’t have control of the situation.""

""And again, I’m disappointed in both the WHO and the local governments, because it can clearly spread around Western Africa,"" he added.

Dr. Siegel was clear: He does not think the Marburg virus will become the next pandemic, as ""it’s too stable to mutate in that direction.""

""In nature, this is not going to cause a pandemic.""

He did express concern, however, about viruses being ""played with"" in the lab.

""I can’t tell you 100% that something won’t happen in a lab,"" he said. ""That’s where my concern is. But in nature, this is not going to cause a pandemic — it’s only going to cause sporadic outbreaks. And it can be controlled, as it just was in Tanzania.""

Vice President Kamala Harris was just in Tanzania a couple of weeks ago, said Dr. Siegel — but there's a ""really low chance"" that she would have been exposed.

China records world’s 1st human death caused by H3N8 bird flu,"A Chinese woman has become the first person to die from a type of bird flu that is rare in humans, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said, but the strain does not appear to spread between people.

The 56-year-old woman from the southern province of Guangdong was the third person known to have been infected with the H3N8 subtype of avian influenza, the WHO said in a statement late on Tuesday.

All of the cases have been in China, with the first two cases reported last year.

The Guangdong Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported the third infection late last month but did not provide details of the woman's death.

The patient had multiple underlying conditions, said the WHO, and a history of exposure to live poultry.

Sporadic infections in people with bird flu are common in China where avian flu viruses constantly circulate in huge poultry and wild bird populations.

Samples collected from a wet market visited by the woman before she became ill were positive for influenza A(H3), said the WHO, suggesting this may have been the source of infection.

COULD A BIRD FLU PANDEMIC SPREAD TO HUMANS? HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Though rare in people, H3N8 is common in birds in which it causes little to no sign of disease. It has also infected other mammals.

There were no other cases found among close contacts of the infected woman, the WHO said.

""Based on available information, it appears that this virus does not have the ability to spread easily from person to person, and therefore the risk of it spreading among humans at the national, regional, and international levels is considered to be low,"" the WHO said in the statement.

France's Macron defends controversial comments on being US ally amid Chinese aggression toward Taiwan,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday defended controversial comments he made during his trip to China last week regarding Europe’s relationship with the U. S. as it relates to escalating tensions with Beijing over Taiwan.

In a press conference from the Netherlands, Macron told reporters that ""being an ally does not mean being a vassal,"" adding that it ""doesn't mean that we don't have the right to think for ourselves.""

""France is for the status quo in Taiwan"" and a ""peaceful resolution to the situation,"" he said, according to DW, following pushback he has received over his comments suggesting that Europeans must not be ""followers"" of the U. S.

FRANCE'S MACRON MET WITH ANGRY PROTESTS DURING SPEECH IN NETHERLANDS, DAY AFTER SPARKING OUTRAGE ON TAIWAN

On Monday Macron raised international eyebrows after he was quoted from a Friday interview as having said, ""The question we need to answer, as Europeans, is the following: Is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No.""

""The worst thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the U. S. agenda and a Chinese overreaction,"" he added.

The Biden administration has remained quiet in response to the French president’s comments during his trip to China – a nation listed as the U. S.’s top adversary and chief threat across the spectrum.

But Republicans on and off the Hill have outwardly condemned the comments, including GOP 2024 presidential candidate Donald Trump, who said, ""Macron, who's a friend of mine, is over with China, kissing his a--,"" in reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Macron responded to the former president’s comments and condemned them as escalatory.

""France does not support provocations, does not engage in fantasy politics and considers the status quo, respect and clarity are the best allies of European strategic autonomy,"" Macron said, according to DW.

"Vancouver police remove, arrest squatter who set up encampment on one of city's most expensive properties","Police in Canada have removed a squatter who had set up a makeshift shelter on one of the most expensive pieces of real estate in Vancouver and lived there for almost a year.

A campsite on Vancouver’s Belmont Avenue overlooking Spanish Banks Beach, one of the most pricey and exclusive streets in the city, was completely dismantled by police on Tuesday, and a squatter was arrested, CTV News reported.

The man arrested was identified as Joseph Grenon, and he has been charged with mischief, but police did not offer more specifics beyond that.

""This was an ongoing issue in the community, something our officers took very seriously,"" police said in an email.

Squatting has been a significant issue for residents in the area, specifically on the three large side-by-side lots on Belmont Ave that are valued at roughly $60 million.

Squatters have set up makeshift buildings with wooden planks and blue tarps, changed the locks to the gates multiple times and even brought their own toilets onto the property, the Vancouver Sun reported.

FBI arrests Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira in probe of classified document leaks,"FBI agents arrested Massachusetts Air National Guardsman Jack Douglas Teixeira at a home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, on Thursday in connection with a trove of classified documents that have been leaked online in recent months.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Teixeira, 21, is being investigated for the ""alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.""

Teixeira, who joined the Air National Guard in September 2019, held the highest-level security clearance granted by the federal government for top secret information, according to an internal Department of Defense email reviewed by Fox News.

His security clearance and access to classified government systems have since been revoked, according to another internal government document.

WHO IS JACK TEIXEIRA, THE AIR NATIONAL GUARDSMEN ALLEGEDLY BEHIND LEAKED CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

Teixeira was most recently stationed at Otis Air National Guard Base as a member of the of 102nd Intelligence Wing. He was promoted to Airman 1st Class last July, according to the unit.

The FBI began surveilling Teixeira in connection with the leaks before Thursday, but were forced to accelerate their plans to arrest him after the New York Times identified him on Thursday morning, a source briefed on the investigation told Fox News.

That New York Times report named Teixeira as the leader of a Discord group called ""Thug Shaker Central"" that consisted of roughly 20 to 30 young men.

Teixeira allegedly starting sharing classified documents with the private group in recent months, but the leaks gained wider attention after another member shared them in a public forum, according to the report.

Investigators don't believe that the case ends with Teixeira and are looking at others who may be involved, a source told Fox News.

The National Guard said in a statement it is aware of the ""alleged role a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman may have played in the recent leak of highly-classified documents"" from the Pentagon.

PENTAGON DOCUMENT LEAK HAS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY: SUCKS UP ‘A LOT OF OXYGEN’

""The National Guard takes this issue very seriously and will support investigators,"" the National Guard said in a statement. ""National security is our foremost priority and any attempt to undermine it compromises our values and degrades trust among our members, the public, allies and partners.""

Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder called the leaks ""a deliberate criminal act,"" saying that distribution lists for classified information are being reviewed.

LEAKER OF CLASSIFIED US INTELLIGENCE WORKS ON MILITARY BASE, POSTED THE DOCUMENTS ON DISCORD: REPORT

""We entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age,"" Ryder said at a press conference on Thursday.

""You've received training and you will receive an understanding of the rules and requirements that come along with those responsibilities, and you're expected to abide by those rules, regulations and responsibility. It's called military discipline. And in certain cases, especially when it comes to sensitive information, it also is about the law.""

Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks sent a memo to Pentagon officials on Tuesday, warning employees against leaking classified information or downloading classified documents from unclassified sources.

""Do not access or download documents with classified markings from unclassified websites – either from home or work – as the data may be classified, it may be associated with hostile foreign elements, or it may contain malicious code or embedded capability that could introduce cyber threats into our information system,"" Hicks wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Fox News.

LEAKED PENTAGON DOCUMENTS PAINT GRIM PICTURE OF UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE SUPPLIES, MAY ONLY LAST A MONTH

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also ordered a review on Thursday of ""intelligence access, accountability and control procedures"" to ensure that leaks like this don't happen again.

A large police presence could be seen on Thursday in Teixeira's quiet neighborhood in North Dighton, a small town about 35 miles south of Boston.

""This is where I live, so it's crazy to see all this going on here,"" a member of the community told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

""I don't know the parents, but I know of [Teixeira] because of my son - they rode the [school] bus together. They've lived there a long time and obviously as a parent I feel horrible for them.""

President Biden said earlier Thursday that the U. S. was ""getting close"" to finding the person responsible for leaking Pentagon documents that the Department of Defense has described as containing ""sensitive and highly-classified material.""

""I can’t right now [give an update]. There is a full-blown investigation going on with the intelligence community and Justice Department and they are getting close,"" Biden told reporters during his trip to Ireland. ""I don’t have an answer for you.""

The president also said, ""I’m concerned that it happened, but there is nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.""

The leaked documents mainly concern Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but also include intelligence on China, the Middle East, Israel's spy agency Mossad, and world leaders.

U. S. defense officials previously told Fox News that this leak could be ""bigger than Snowden"" in terms of damage to intelligence and allied relationships.

Teixeira is expected to make his first court appearance some time on Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., a source with the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts said.

Global population hits 8 billion and we need to keep growing. Here's why,"According to the United Nations, the world’s population just surpassed 8 billion on Nov. 15, 2022. This milestone, of course, is being condemned in some quarters as a threat to ""sustainable development"" and global standards of living.

Some neo-Malthusians are using the occasion to raise alarm about the dangers of overpopulation to the global food supply and warn of impending famine. Should we take any of this hand-wringing seriously?

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently tweeted, ""A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far."" He continued, ""Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated, even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse.""

Musk has been issuing such warnings for years, with some commentators ridiculing him in return.

SPERM COUNTS AND CONCENTRATIONS DECLINING GLOBALLY SINCE 1970S BUT FERTILITY IMPLICATIONS UNKNOWN: STUDY

Musk often does not elaborate further, except for stating the obvious: no people, no future. Or as he tweeted earlier this year, ""unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world."" He makes a good point.

An average fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman per lifetime is needed to keep population at a replacement level. And while it is true that the world’s population is still expanding, fertility rates in many of the world’s most advanced nations are indeed collapsing.

The Japanese fertility rate, for example, is 1.4. It is 0.9 in South Korea, 1.2 in Spain and 1.3 in Italy. The world’s population, in the meantime, will likely peak at 9.8 billion people at around 2080 and fall to 9.5 billion by 2100 in the medium-fertility scenario calculated by demographer Wolfgang Lutz and his colleagues at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.

Does population growth matter beyond Musk’s existential concerns? Yes, because population and economic growth rates are intimately connected.

Prior to 1750, the Bank of England found that the global GDP growth per person averaged 0.01%, thus doubling every 6,000 years. Since 1750, it averaged 1.5%, thus doubling every 50 years.  It is not coincidental, my co-author and I argue in ""Superabundance: The Story of Population Growth, Innovation, and Human Flourishing on an Infinitely Bountiful Planet,"" that the growth in GDP per person went hand-in-hand with population growth, which languished around 0.5 billion between the time of Christ and the 1600s, rose to 1 billion in 1800, and exploded to 8 billion in 2022.

CHINA'S POPULATION EXPECTED TO DIP AHEAD OF 2025: OFFICIAL

The key to understanding the connection between population and economic growth rates rests in the crucial role played by innovation.

In his 2016 book, ""A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy,"" Northwestern University economic historian Joel Mokyr distinguished between (Adam) ""Smithian"" growth that’s based on the division of labor and trade, and (Joseph) ""Schumpeterian"" growth that’s based on ""creative destruction"" and new ideas. To appreciate the difference, think of the output of a miner wielding a pickaxe and a miner using an electric drill. To be sure, people have always innovated (just think of the eyeglasses that were developed in Northern Italy in the 13th century). But a period of sustained innovation, which separates the last 200 years from the previous millennia, is truly new.

In our book, we examined the prices of hundreds of commodities, goods and services spanning two centuries. This analysis found that everything from food and fuel to minerals and metals became much more abundant as the population grew. That was especially true when we looked at ""time prices,"" which represent the length of time that people must work to buy something. In fact, our analysis of 18 randomly chosen datasets going back to 1850 suggests that every 1% increase in population reduces the time price of goods and services by over 1%. Furthermore, we found that abundance increased faster than the population – a relationship that we call ""superabundance.""

The day may come when artificial intelligence starts producing new ideas. In the meantime, we must rely on the human brain. As the British author Matt Ridley wrote in his 2020 book, ""How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom,"" ""Innovation is the most important fact about the modern world, but one of the least well understood."" What we can say is that a population of 1 billion is sure to produce fewer useful ideas than a population of 10 billion, and that would retard economic growth.

But large populations are not enough to sustain superabundance – just think of the poverty in China and India before liberalization. To innovate, people must be allowed to think, speak, publish, associate and disagree. They must be allowed to save, invest, trade and profit.

The threat to humanity, therefore, goes beyond our collapsing fertility rates. Superabundance also depends on human freedom and equal dignity, which started in Western Europe during the Enlightenment and then spread elsewhere.

To the extent that freedom and dignity are in retreat, and the values of the Enlightenment are under attack, we should all share Elon Musk’s concern over the future of our species.

New product acts as 'copilot for doctors',"America’s medical community appears to be embracing artificial intelligence products in an effort to speed up patient care and prevent burnout among health care professionals.

AI technology is already rolling out in doctors' offices, hospitals and clinics nationwide through a variety of formats.

California-based Regard has launched its AI product, a system that enables doctors to automate routine tasks, in 30 hospitals, its CEO said.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WON’T EVER BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND THIS ONE THING

""What we started developing was essentially an AI copilot for doctors,"" Eli Ben-Joseph, co-founder and CEO of Regard, told Fox News.

The company’s software allows computers to diagnose a patient, assist with doctors' notes and alert professionals when something may have been overlooked.

The company told Fox News that the solution's ability to streamline workflows may allow doctors to spend less time on paperwork and administrative tasks.

""We like to say it's almost like having an AI med student or an AI medical resident that helps the doctors with their day-to-day,"" added Ben-Joseph.

The AI medical industry is expected to grow significantly in the next several years.

The technology may save U. S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in health care costs on an annual basis, researchers found.

Separate studies, however, have indicated that the public remains cautious about embracing AI when it comes to medical care.

"Bahrain, Qatar restore relations after 6 year blockade","The Gulf nations of Bahrain and Qatar agreed to restore diplomatic relations late Wednesday.

Bahrain had been the last holdout of four Arab nations that imposed a boycott and blockade on Qatar in 2017. They were angered by Qatar's support for Islamist groups that rose to power in some countries following the 2011 Arab Spring protests, which the other autocratic nations viewed as terrorist organizations.

The blockade was lifted at the start of 2021, and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have restored ties with Qatar since then, with top leaders paying official visits in recent months.

Bahrain and Qatar each issued official statements announcing the decision to restore relations following a meeting between their delegations at the headquarters of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-nation bloc of which both are members, in the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

The four nations had severed all ties to Qatar, and at the height of the crisis there was even talk in local media of digging a trench along the 54-mile border between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and filling it with nuclear waste.

The boycott had little impact on Qatar's economy, however. The tiny Gulf country, which hosted soccer's World Cup last year, is one of the wealthiest countries on Earth owing to its vast natural gas reserves. Turkey, which is also friendly to Islamist groups, stepped in to aid Qatar during the crisis.

Future of the internet or a 'Ponzi scheme' — what exactly is Web3?,"Some call it the next phase of the internet. Some say it's a fast-money scam that'll fall apart. But what exactly is Web3?

The phrase ""Web3"" is used broadly to refer to a new-era internet that will run on the record-keeping technology blockchain, a decentralized public accounting system. The current iteration of the internet, Web2, by comparison, runs on centralized, company-owned servers.

Web3 ""offers a read/write/own version of the web, in which users have a financial stake in and more control over the web communities they belong to"" by enabling users to own their data, according to the Harvard Business Review.

Investors hope this version of the internet will lead to a democratization of data on the web, where transactions and contracts can be double-checked by all users. However, consumers should be skeptical, according to venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, as mainstream products have yet to materialize despite heavy cash investments.

""A lot of what people are calling Web3 was a Ponzi scheme, and it made no sense whatsoever,"" the Palantir co-founder previously told Fox News. ""That said, the protocols to have decentralized ownership are very interesting.""

Decentralization, a key feature of blockchain, distributes the responsibilities of key internet functions such as server control, transaction confirmation, and time stamping to a network of users rather than traditional methods where all operations would be handled by one company or organization. Where something like Amazon Web Services' servers hosted nearly 30% of the internet in 2020, Web3 promises to distribute that responsibility among users, fundamentally changing online interactions.

Decentralized digital infrastructure — such as cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — are designed to be key components of Web3 and would be necessary for its function.

""Longer term, it does make sense to have more decentralized power and for something like Bitcoin to exist,"" Lonsdale said in a previous interview. Bitcoin ""allows more kind of liberty for the financial system from really bad-acting governments.""

But they got the call that he had died in the jail,"" attorney Michael Harper of the Harper Law Firm told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Jail officials placed Thompson in the psychiatric wing after determining he had schizophrenia, Harper said. The attorney shared several extremely graphic photos of Thompson and the filth he allegedly died in at the detention facility in a Wednesday press release.

Three months after his placement in the psychiatric wing, Thompson ""was found in a filthy jail cell after being eaten alive by insects and bed bugs,"" the press release states.

Public records obtained by Harper's law office apparently show that detention officers and medical staff at the jail noticed Thompson's deterioration — including an infection from bedbugs and lice on his torso — while he was still alive but did nothing to aid him.

There were ""plans"" to transfer him to another unit of the jail that never came to fruition when they eventually found Thompson dead in the cell, Harper alleged.

""They literally watched his health decline until he died. When his body was found one of the detention officers refused to administer CPR because in her words she 'freaked out,'"" Harper wrote in the press release.

'Cult mom' phone call with best friend revealed in court,"An Idaho courtroom on Thursday heard a recorded December 2019 phone call between ""cult mom"" Lori Vallow and her longtime friend, Melanie Gibb, according to local reports.

Vallow is accused of killing her two children, who disappeared in September 2019, and her husband Chad Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell, in October 2019.

""I’m not telling anybody where he is, so I can keep him as safe as possible,"" Vallow said during the call, referring to her 7-year-old son, J. J., according to FOX 10 reporter Justin Lum. She added that she believes his grandmother, Kay Woodcock, was conspiring against her.

""He is safe and happy,"" Vallow says of J. J.

The call was played aloud while Gibb took the stand in Vallow's Ada County murder trial.

In the call, a concerned Gibb asks Vallow about J. J.'s whereabouts after Vallow told authorities the 7-year-old was with Gibb. Vallow said she did what she felt the Lord told her to do, Lum reported.

LORI VALLOW TRIAL: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT ‘CULT MOM’ ACCUSED OF KILLING 2 KIDS, HUSBAND'S FIRST WIFE

Vallow proceeded to ""promise"" Gibb she has ""done nothing wrong in this case"" and tells Gibb she loves her multiple times.

""We are both standing there with Jesus Christ,"" Vallow tells Gibb before abruptly hanging up.

Prosecutors argue Vallow was motivated by ""money, power and sex"" and her extreme religious beliefs shared with Daybell, to kill her two children. The ""doomsday mom"" married Daybell in Hawaii in November 2019, two months after her children went missing. Prosecutors also said she bought wedding rings prior to Tammy Daybell's October 2019 death.

Vallow and Daybell believed people emit light or dark spirits and allegedly believed Vallow's 17-year-old daughter, Tylee, and Tammy Daybell had dark spirits.

Gibb told the courtroom Thursday she recorded the phone call out of concern for J. J. and his safety, knowing that he was not with her or Kay Woodcock, according to Lum.

Gibb also testified that Vallow said Jesus appeared to her in a temple, and she felt called to get the dark spirit out of Tammy Daybell.

Authorities have said J. J. was found in a plastic bag on Daybell's property while Tylee's remains were found dismembered and burned.

"US CENTCOM captures ISIS operative, associates in helicopter raid in Syria","U. S. Central Command forces over the weekend captured an ISIS operative and his associates in a helicopter raid that the command believes will help further destabilize the terrorist group.

CENTCOM said the helicopter raid was carried out in Syria late Saturday evening. The forces captured Hudayfah al Yemeni – an ""ISIS attack facilitator"" – and two of his associates.

No civilians were killed or injured in the raid, CENTCOM said.

""Operations against ISIS are important for the security and stability of the region,"" CENTCOM spokesman Col. Joe Buccino. ""ISIS remains a threat to the region and beyond – the group retains the capability to conduct operations in Iraq and Syria with a desire to strike beyond the Middle East, and its vile ideology remains a threat.""

Buccino added that such operations reaffirm the U. S.’ commitment to the ""enduring defeat of ISIS.""

Around 900 U. S. forces remain inside Syria, with an undisclosed number of contractors. U.S. Special Operations forces also move in and out of the country but are usually in small teams and are not included in the official count.

American forces are trying to prevent the re-emergence of ISIS, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking large swaths of territory before their near-total defeat in Syria in 2019.

In March, CENTCOM, along with coalition and other partners, carried out more than three dozen operations against ISIS, resulting in nine operatives killed and 18 detained.

Who is Nima Momeni? Suspect in Bob Lee stabbing in San Francisco,"California police have arrested a self-described tech entrepreneur in connection with the stabbing death of Silicon Valley mogul Bob Lee, the founder of Cash App and an executive at Square and MobileCoin who was killed last week.

San Francisco jail records show that Nima Momeni, 38, was booked around 9:20 a.m. Thursday on a charge of first-degree murder. District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she had also filed a special circumstance allegation that the crime had been committed with a knife.

A LinkedIn profile in Momeni's name identifies the IT professional as the owner of an outsourcing firm called Expand-IT.

Momeni lived in Emeryville, on the other end of the Bay Bridge from where San Francisco police found Lee bleeding from stab wounds after 2:30 a.m. on April 4.

Momeni attended the University of California, Berkeley, and has also worked as a consultant and network engineer, according to the profile.

""We can confirm that Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni knew each other; however, we will not be able to provide further details at this time regarding the evidence,"" San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said during a Thursday afternoon news briefing.

He said police served two search warrants in San Francisco and another in Emeryville, where they arrested Momeni at his home, on the mainland side of San Francisco's Bay Bridge, across the bay from where Lee was seen on shocking surveillance video stumbling and cradling his wounded side before police arrived last week.

When pressed on crime in the city, Scott blamed human nature and not geography for the crime.

""This has nothing to do with San Francisco,"" he said. ""This has to do with human nature.""

CASH APP FOUNDER BOB LEE DIED PLEADING WITH 911 FOR HELP: REPORT

""We followed the evidence, and there was a lot of evidence,"" Scott said, but he declined to go into specifics, citing the ongoing investigation.

Expand-IT's website reveals few details about its business and does not have a roster of its leadership or contain information about its founding.

""We specialize in providing technical support and fulfillment solutions at scale to startups, SMEs, public sector, and nonprofit organizations,"" a description of its work reads. ""Our approach is designed to deliver the power of a fully staffed and experienced IT department at a fraction of the cost of managing it in-house.""

"Tunisian officials report 25 Europe-bound migrants dead, 15 missing in Mediterranean","At least 25 African migrants died and 15 are missing after a boat carrying them toward Europe sank in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Tunisia this week, Tunisian authorities said.

The Tunisian coast guard on Thursday recovered the bodies of 15 people trapped under the boat near the coast of Sfax, a port in east-central Tunisia, Sfax Prosecutor Faouzi Masmoudi told the Associated Press.

On Wednesday, the coast guard recovered 10 other bodies and rescued 72 migrants from the sunken vessel he said. The prosecutor estimated that 15 to 20 others who had been on the boat are still missing, based on survivors' accounts.

"California doctor accused in Drano poison plot wanted to kill ants, not estranged husband","The California dermatologist accused of poisoning her estranged husband with drain-clearing chemicals mixed up the cocktail to kill ants, not her spouse, according to her lawyer.

A grand jury indicted Dr. Yue ""Emily"" Yu, 45, of Irvine, last week on three counts of felony poisoning and another of domestic battery.

Dr. Jack Chen, Yu's 53-year-old husband, filed for an order of protection over the summer after he said he suffered internal injuries and rigged their kitchen with home surveillance cameras that allegedly caught her spiking his lemonade.

Following a court appearance Tuesday, her attorney David Dworakowski told reporters that the couple had an ant infestation at their home that Yu was trying to address.

""While prosecutors are making it out like this video of Emily is a 'smoking gun,' the reality is she was trying to attract the ants into the glass so they would drown,"" Dworakowski told the New York Post.

He did not immediately return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

The cameras, Chen alleged in court filings, recorded Yu spiking his drinks with Drano, a brand-name chemical drain cleaner that the U. S. government describes as ""very dangerous"" if ingested, inhaled or placed in contact with the skin or eyes.

""On three separate occasions of I have video of her pouring Draino (sic) taken from under our kitchen sink and pouring it into my lemonade (I drink it hot),"" he wrote in a petition to the court.

CALIFORNIA DERMATOLOGIST ARRESTED AFTER HUSBAND SHARED ‘COMPELLING' VIDEO OF HER POISONING HIM, POLICE SAY

Chen put the cameras in place after becoming suspicious in March and April of last year, after noticing ""a chemical taste"" in his lemonade and being diagnosed with ulcers, gastritis and esophagitis, according to the filing.

In one instance, he said, he covered his drink with plastic wrap — and she allegedly peeled it off, spiked the drink, and replaced the covering.

Yu faces a maximum of eight years and eight months in prison if convicted on all counts, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

She is scheduled for arraignment next Tuesday in Santa Ana.

Yu will also have her medical license reviewed by the state board and could lose it, according to prosecutors.

Conflict-plagued Sudan region reports 14 killed in 3 days,"* At least 14 people have been killed this week in Sudan's troubled Darfur region.

* West Darfur's governor has imposed a two-week state of emergency and a nighttime curfew in hopes of stemming violence.

* A 2003 insurgency by sub-Saharan rebels plunged the region into chaos, and it has remained embroiled in conflict since.

Bloodshed in Sudan's long-troubled Darfur region has left at least 14 people dead over the last three days, two activists said Tuesday.

Adam Haroun, a local activist, said clashes erupted Sunday in West Darfur province after Arab gunmen on motorcycles shot and killed a trader in the remote town of Fur Baranga.

The killing sparked a series of reprisal attacks between Arabic and African tribal groups and looting, said Adam Regal, spokesman for a local organization that helps run refugee camps in Darfur.

The violence continued Tuesday and the death toll was likely to rise, Haroun said.

On Monday, the governor of West Darfur declared a two-week state of emergency and introduced a night-time curfew across the state.

Analysts see an uptick in violence in recent month between different tribal groups across Sudan’s far-flung regions as a product of a power vacuum and tensions caused by political turmoil.

In late March, at least five people were killed in clashes in West Darfur. Last October, over 170 people were killed in clashes in Blue Nile province, situated in the remote southeast corner of the African country.

Sudan has been steeped in chaos since a military coup, led by the country’s leading Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, removed a Western-backed government in October 2021, upending its short-lived transition to democracy.

In December, the country’s ruling military and various pro-democracy forces signed a preliminary agreement pledging to reinstate the transition. Despite months of wrangling cross-party talks and several deadlines, Sudan's various political factions have yet to agree to a final deal.

The conflict in Darfur first broke out in 2003 when rebels — mostly from the region’s ethnic central and sub-Saharan African community — launched an insurgency, complaining of oppression by the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum.

Lori Vallow trial adjourned early after death in prosecutor's family,"Lori Vallow's murder trial adjourned early Wednesday afternoon after the prosecution announced that there had been a death in one of its lead attorney's families, according to local reports.

Vallow is on trial for the 2019 murders of her two children, 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old J. J. Vallow, and her husband Chad Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell.

""There has been a death in the family of one of the prosecutor’s lead attorneys. The court and defense have been gracious in allowing the prosecution to adjust to this personal situation,"" the prosecution team said in a statement, according to FOX 10 reporter Justin Lum.

"Mothers passed COVID to babies through placenta, possibly causing brain damage, death","Two mothers who gave birth at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida, passed along the COVID-19 infection to their newborns through the placenta, researchers at the University of Miami Health System and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine have found.

In both cases, the infection caused brain damage in the babies, according to a press release summarizing the findings from the study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics on April 6.

Although both babies tested negative for the COVID-19 virus at birth, they experienced ""seizures, small head sizes and developmental delays,"" the press release said.

COVID-19 VACCINE DOES NOT DAMAGE PLACENTA IN PREGNANCY, STUDY FINDS

One of the babies died suddenly at 13 months old.

Tests found that the babies had ""significantly elevated SARS-CoV-2 antibodies"" in their blood, which means either the antibodies crossed the placenta or the babies contracted the virus and produced their own antibodies.

The press release indicated that both pregnant women tested positive for COVID during their second trimesters, then recovered and tested negative.

Yet one of the women contracted the virus again during the third trimester.

This is the first study to show the transmission of COVID through the placenta resulting in brain damage in infants, the press release said.

Dr. Merline Benny, assistant professor of pediatrics and a neonatologist at the University of Miami, was the first author on the paper. She told Fox News Digital that she was surprised by the findings.

This was the first study to detect COVID crossing the placenta into a baby’s brain.

""The presence of the virus in the brain/organ of an infant had never been shown before,"" she said. ""The infants reported were two extreme cases we saw in the NICU [neonatal intensive care unit].""

COVID VACCINES ARE NOT NEEDED FOR HEALTHY KIDS AND TEENS, SAYS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

The hospital has had more than 350 infants born to COVID-positive mothers, and the vast majority of them were fine, Dr. Benny noted. Only a handful of the infants had any symptoms.

Dr. Ken Perry, an emergency physician in Charleston, South Carolina, was not involved in the study but reviewed the findings. He said the most surprising result was the fact that the outcome has been shown only in two patients.

""I do not believe this is a common finding that is occurring,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""The findings of microcephaly [small head size], as well as low Apgar scores [a scoring system used to determine a newborn’s color and breathing] are not common. If they had become more common during COVID, this information would definitely have been shared across pediatric hospitals.""

He added, ""This is a very concerning set of symptoms, especially if it can be directly connected with COVID.""

RECORD-BREAKING TWINS BORN FOUR MONTHS EARLY DEFY ODDS: ‘GOD WAS IN CONTROL’

Earlier in the pandemic, the researchers observed other, less severe issues — such as short-term lung disease and high blood pressure — in babies born to COVID-positive mothers.

In those cases, it wasn’t clear whether the problems stemmed from inflammation or from COVID crossing the placenta.

In addition to signs of the virus and ""severe inflammatory changes"" in the two placentas, the researchers found ""major changes"" in the brain of the baby who passed away.

""I was struck by the unexplained severity of the loss of the white matter and the presence of features of hypoxia/ischemia in the cerebral cortex,"" said Dr. Ali G. Saad, a Miller School professor, neuropathologist and director of the pediatric and perinatal pathology service at Holtz Children’s Hospital, in the press release discussing the findings.

""We became suspicious that the virus, somehow, managed to breach the placental barrier to damage the central nervous system, but this had not been documented before,"" he added.

Dr. Benny reiterated that these two cases of brain injury were highly unusual.

""The vast majority of infants were asymptomatic, so we don't want parents to panic,"" she said. ""This study was targeted at raising awareness among obstetricians, neonatologists and neurologists. However, it is important to conduct further research to study the long-term outcomes in these infants.""

""We don't want parents to panic.""

If a mother is infected with COVID during pregnancy, Dr. Benny recommends monitoring for any developmental delays in the infants.

""If there are any developmental delays noted, they should report it to their pediatrician for further neurological and neurodevelopmental monitoring,"" she said.

""The standard practice in our NICU is to screen all babies born to mothers who test positive with a respiratory swab for PCR [COVID test] starting at 24 hours of life.""

The biggest takeaway for pregnant women, Dr. Perry said, is to not become too nervous about these results.

""Pregnancy is stressful enough without adding another level of stress for pregnant mothers,"" he said.

Given that there were only two infants involved in the study, Dr. Perry doesn’t think it’s necessary for patients to change their habits as of now.

""With these few patients, we are only able to discuss association rather than causation,"" he said.

""There are some similarities between these patients that could account for these outcomes rather than COVID.""

He also said, ""It is important for medical professionals to appropriately evaluate and integrate this data rather than change the normal standard of care. The best thing to do while pregnant is to ensure that mothers are getting appropriate prenatal care.""

For example, the study hypothesizes that the issues stemmed from inflammatory changes in the placenta.

""The best way to monitor this in utero is to have appropriate ultrasounds done to monitor the health of the placenta,"" Dr. Perry said.

""At this time, we do not have much information on maternal COVID during pregnancy and its long-term effects on the infant into childhood and adolescence,"" Dr. Benny told Fox News Digital.

""Conducting such studies into the long-term effects of COVID would be very important.""

Dr. Perry said this research should be followed by additional studies that include many more patients, allowing for better control of independent variables.

""This will allow for a discussion of causation to actually occur, which will guide recommendations going forward.""

The researchers plan to look for the specific ""biomarkers"" that indicate babies who are at a higher risk of having adverse effects from maternal COVID.

Researchers recommend that pregnant women get the COVID vaccine.

To prevent any issues from occurring, the study authors recommend that all women get vaccinated against COVID-19 before or during pregnancy and that they practice ""standard COVID precautions.""

Breastfeeding is also recommended as a means of boosting babies’ immunity, as COVID-19 antibodies have been found in breast milk.

Ultimately, Dr. Perry said the best option is for a patient to have a conversation with her doctor.

Cyprus probing residents involved in alleged Russian sanctions evasion,"Cyprus' government said Thursday it's looking into how a number of Cypriot nationals were included in a new round of U. S. and U.K. sanctions targeting the financial networks of Russian oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Roman Abramovich who are close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides called an emergency meeting of top officials to investigate the involvement of three Cypriot nationals, three executives holding dual Cypriot-Russian citizenship, a Russian Cypriot-Israeli national and another resident of Cyprus who were among executives running Cypriot-registered trusts and other businesses involved in alleged sanctions-busting for Usmanov.

In a statement, government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said a number of decisions were taken ""for the exclusive purpose of protecting Cyprus’ name as a reliable, financial and business center.""

""The president of the republic considers the entire matter as particularly serious and has issued instructions to thoroughly investigate it,"" the statement said.

Cyprus has in recent years been at pains to shake off a reputation of being in the pockets of Russian oligarchs who have concealed their assets through a maze of Cyprus-registered trusts and brass-plate companies. Russian deposits in Cypriot banks have dropped precipitously since a 2013 financial crisis brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy.

Greek Orthodox Church accuses Israeli police of violating 'Holy Fire' worshippers' rights,"The Greek Orthodox Church on Wednesday accused Israeli police of infringing on the freedom of worshippers with ""heavy-handed"" restrictions on how many pilgrims can attend the ""Holy Fire"" ceremony amid soaring tensions.

Israeli police said the limits are needed for safety during Saturday's celebration at the ancient Church of the Holy Sepulcher, a holy site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected.

Saturday’s ""Holy Fire"" celebration comes during a recent spate of violence in the Old City, touched off by an Israeli police raid on Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site, the compound that’s home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The tensions spiraled into a regional confrontation between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria, and were punctuated Friday when two British-Israeli sisters and their mother were killed after their car came under fire near a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank. The mother succumbed to her wounds on Monday.

Israel, which imposed similar restrictions on the ""Holy Fire"" event last year, says it wants to prevent another disaster after a crowd stampede in 2021 at a packed Jewish holy site left 45 people dead. Christian leaders say there’s no need to alter a ceremony that has been held for centuries.

Eastern Orthodox Christians believe that on the Saturday before Easter, a miraculous flame appears inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. The Greek patriarch enters the Holy Edicule, a chamber built on the traditional site of Jesus' tomb, and emerges with two lit candles. He passes the flame among thousands of people holding candles, gradually illuminating the walls of the darkened basilica. The flame will be transferred to Orthodox communities in other countries on special flights. The source of the Holy Fire has been a closely guarded secret for centuries, with an abundance of skeptics.

Church officials told reporters in Jerusalem on Wednesday that negotiations with the police over their ""heavy-handed"" restrictions had failed.

""After many attempts made in good will, we are not able to coordinate with the Israeli authorities as they are enforcing unreasonable restrictions on access to the Holy Sepulcher,"" the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem said, calling the limitations ""heavy-handed.""

""We will hold the ceremony as customary for two millennia and invite all who wish to worship with us to attend,"" said Father Mattheos Siopis of the Greek Orthodox Church. ""We leave the authorities to act as they will. The churches will freely worship and do so in peace.""

COLUMBIA'S PLAN TO OPEN ISRAEL CENTER SPARKS FACULTY OUTCRY OVER 'RIGHT WING' GOVERNMENT: REPORT

Israeli police officials acknowledged that they are increasing security and blocking some routes into the dense Old City and that attendance is limited in the ancient church and courtyard. But in a conference call with reporters, officials said the attendance limits — 1,800 people inside the church which Greek Orthodox officials said was a fraction of previous years — were set by the church.

Chief Superintendent Yoram Segal of the Jerusalem District Police told reporters during a conference call that the police's top priority is safety on a day when Muslims, Christians and Jews are celebrating their own holidays in the square-half mile Old City.

""We are going to regulate the movement of crowds,"" Segal said, adding that the holy fire ceremony will be available throughout the city on video screens and that meetings with the churches are ongoing.

The eight members and associates belong to a subset of the Crips known as the Insane Crip Gang, or ICG.

The defendants named in the indictment are Akeem Chambers, of Uniondale, New York; Jahziah Dindyal, 19, of Hempstead, New York; Jonathan Gonzalez, 23, of Greensboro, North Carolina; Lesly Pardo, 26, of Mount Sinai, New York; Rob Pardo, 25, of Mount Sinai, New York; Jalen Rogers, 20, of Hempstead, New York; and Jonathan Vazquez, 21, of Hempstead, New York.

ARREST OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS LEAK SUSPECT JACK TEIXEIRA MET WITH OUTRAGE: ‘INCOMPETENCE IS STUNNING’

According to a press release from the DOJ, seven of the suspects were taken into custody on Thursday morning and one remains at large.

The suspects are accused of participating in dozens of gang-related shootings and multiple murders in Nassau County, New York since 2015.

Chambers, the release read, took part in over a dozen shootings between 2020 and 2022. One of those shootings resulted in the death of 28-year-old Thiasia Williams.

On Aug. 1, 2020, Chambers, Rob Pardo and another associate of the ICG went to a party in Hempstead where members of a rival gang were expected to be.

Chambers and an associate, each armed with a 9mm fired at least eight times at party goers with Gonzalez behind the wheel. One of the bullets struck Williams, who was sitting in her car outside the party to pick up a friend. Another bystander was also struck by gunfire, and the wound was non-life-threatening.

Chambers is also accused of participating in the robbery of James Diamond in Freeport, New York in 2021. During the incident, Chambers and another person were armed with guns, approached Diamond and another man, and attempted to rob them at gunpoint.

The DOJ said Chambers’ co-conspirator shot and killed Diamond.

Rogers was charged with more than a half-dozen violent crimes including attempted murder and attempted kidnapping, and at least three of the crimes occurred while he was wearing a court-ordered GPS ankle monitor that placed him at the scene of shootings.

Vazquez, the release read, was charged with killing 19-year-old Joecephus Vanable in November 2016.

Vanable, the DOJ said, was repeatedly targeted by the ICG until he was allegedly shot and killed in Hempstead by Vazquez.

Gang members bragged about the killing on social media, rap videos and in graffiti all around Hempstead.

Vazquez was also accused of opening fire on two Nassau County Police officers who attempted to conduct a traffic stop of his vehicle.

The indictment also included allegations that the gang members netted hundreds of thousands of dollars through fraudulent unemployment benefits applications and the federal Covid-19 Paycheck Protection Program, as well as through identity theft and bank fraud.

Investigators linked 26 guns to the defendants, and 14 of the 26 guns were linked to several shootings committed by members of the ICG.

If convicted, Pardo faces up to 20 years in prison, while the other six defendants face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Reduce your colon cancer risk with regular screenings,"Colorectal cancer is becoming more prevalent among younger people and at more advanced stages, recent studies have shown.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) has found that one in five diagnoses are in people younger than age 55. Advanced disease affects three in five people.

These shifting patterns highlight the importance of screening and early detection as life-saving measures.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer seen in both men and women in the U. S., according to data from the American Cancer Society.

DISTANT-STAGE COLON CANCER SHOWING UP MORE IN YOUNGER ADULTS, STUDY SAYS

This year alone, it is estimated there will be 106,970 new colon cancer diagnoses and 46,050 new cases of rectal cancer

Dr. Kyle S. Eldredge, a general and colorectal surgeon in Wellington, Florida, said that in people over 50 years old, the overall incidence of colorectal cancer actually has been dropping over the last three decades due to increased screening.

""However, for people younger than 50, the incidence has been increasing by 1-2% per year since the 1990s,"" he told Fox News Digital.

It’s predicted that by 2030, colorectal cancer will be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among people ages 20 to 49.

""The exact reason for this increase in younger persons is unclear, but it is thought to be linked to diet, lifestyle and the gut microbiome,"" said Dr. Eldredge.

Although diagnoses have skewed younger in recent years, age is the biggest risk factor of colorectal cancer — over 90% of cases are diagnosed in those older than 45, noted Dr. Eldredge.

Age is the biggest risk factor of colorectal cancer.

""Family history is another important risk factor — having a single first-degree relative with colorectal cancer can increase your risk two- or three-fold,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Other risk factors include inflammatory bowel disease — ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease — which are inherited disorders that lead to increased polyp growth, [as well as] smoking, obesity and alcohol intake.""

In many people, early-stage colorectal cancer doesn’t cause symptoms, Dr. Eldredge said.

AI TESTING OF BRAIN TUMORS CAN DETECT GENETIC CANCER MARKERS IN LESS THAN 90 SECONDS, STUDY FINDS

Yet it’s important to know the warning signs. These include changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, bloody stool, weakness and fatigue, rectal bleeding, anemia due to blood loss and unexplained weight loss.

""The most effective way to prevent the development of colorectal cancer is through screening,"" said Dr. Eldredge.

""Early-stage cancer starts as noncancerous polyps. Through screening and removal of these polyps, the risk of colorectal cancer can be reduced by 75% to 85%.""

The ACS recommends that screening should start at age 45 for those persons at average risk.

Early screening is the best way to lower the risk of colorectal cancer.

""The most effective screening method is via colonoscopy, which uses a camera to directly visualize the colon,"" said Dr. Eldredge. ""Any polyps that are found can be removed.""

The ACS recommends that people of average risk get a colonoscopy every 10 years.

For higher-risk people who have a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, Dr. Eldredge recommends increasing the frequency to every five years.

Another type of visual screening test is the CT (computed topography) colonography, which uses a computer to capture three-dimensional images of the colon and rectum.

There are also stool-based studies that are not as invasive, but need to be done more frequently.

""Although each test has its advantages, the best test is the one that gets done,"" said Dr. Eldredge.

Top Peruvian politician gets 12 years for journalist's 1988 murder,"A Peruvian judge convicted retired army general and conservative politician Daniel Urresti and sentenced him to 12 years in prison Thursday for his role 35 years ago in the murder of a journalist who covered abuses during Peru’s civil war.

Hailed by advocates as an overdue but key verdict in upholding accountability and press freedom in Peru, the sentence represented a remarkable turnaround for Urresti, who has been an interior minister, congressman and presidential candidate as well as a frequent political commentator.

Urresti was a military intelligence officer in November 1988 when journalist Hugo Bustíos was machine-gunned and blown up with dynamite in a slaying initially blamed on the communist militant group Shining Path. A fellow journalist with Bustíos survived the attack.

Members of the military later were convicted of carrying out the ambush during a plainclothes patrol in Huanta province to prevent the journalist from covering news of military abuses against civilians in the largely indigenous region. The man who had been the local military commander was convicted in the attack in 2007, and he implicated Urresti as a member of that patrol in 2011.

Judge Juan Santillán issued the sentence Thursday in Lima as Urresti listened along with his wife and daughter, whom he hugged before being taken into custody by the police. Prosecutors had requested 25 years, but said they were satisfied with the decision. Urresti indicated he would appeal.

Sharmelí Bustíos, daughter of the murdered journalist and his late widow, told reporters that after 35 years, ""I can tell my parents that they can finally rest in peace.""

The National Association of Journalists said in statements on social media that the verdict was restitution both for the family of Bustíos and for journalism. ""It is an important step towards justice and the defense of press freedom in Peru,"" the group said.

Urresti was a popular interior minister in 2014-15 under President Ollanta Humala, with a reputation for being outspoken and taking a hard line against crime. He served in Peru’s Congress in 2020-21.

POLICE OFFICER IN PERU ATTACKED, BURNED TO DEATH AS MOB PROTESTS OUSTER OF PRESIDENT CASTILLO

The conviction against the politician came only after a second trial. He initially was acquitted in a verdict that was annulled in 2019 by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial saying that the previous process had been riddled with errors.

The Huanta province capital, also called Huanta, about 370 miles southeast of Lima, was one of the most violent cities during the war that raged between the Peruvian military and the Shining Path from 1980 to 2000.

Herminia Oré, who represents disappeared and tortured people of that city, told a journalist from The Associated Press in 2015 that there was an atmosphere of paranoia in Huanta during the conflict. ""A candle lit in your house at night was a reason for the military to arrest you,"" she said.

California reparations panel says total cost 'least important' aspect despite potential $800B price tag,"A member of California's reparations task force is dismissing the total dollar amount as the ""least important piece"" of their proposal, despite the committee considering doling out nearly triple the state's existing budget in payments to Black residents as a way to make amends for slavery and subsequent discrimination.

""We want to make sure that this is presented out in a way that does not reinforce the preoccupation with a dollar figure, which is the least important piece of this,"" Cheryl Grills, a clinical psychologist and member of the California Reparations Task Force, told CalMatters in a new interview.

""It's important,"" continued Grills, ""but it's the least important in terms of being able to get to a point in our country's history and in California's history where we recognize that the harm cuts across multiple areas and domains and that the repair needs to align with that.""

Last month, economists predicted in a preliminary estimate that California's reparations plan could cost the state over $800 billion. The task force, which consulted five economists and policy experts to arrive at the number, clarified that the total does not include compensations for property the group says was taken unjustly, or for the devaluation of Black-owned businesses. California's total annual budget currently sits at roughly $300 billion.

The task force had previously been considering a proposal to give just under $360,000 per person to approximately 1.8 million Black Californians who had an ancestor enslaved in the U. S., putting the total cost of the program at about $640 billion.

It's unclear how California would pay for large-scale reparations. Newsom announced in January that the state faces a projected budget deficit of $22.5 billion for the coming fiscal year. Then weeks later, the California Legislative Analyst's Office, a government agency that analyzes the budget for the state legislature, estimated in a subsequent report that Newsom's forecast undershot the mark by about $7 billion.

Still, Grills chided the media for covering California's reparations proposals by focusing on the dollar amount.

""It's really unfortunate. I'm actually sad to see that our news media is not able to nuance better,"" she said. ""It's almost like, 'What's going to be sensational' as opposed to what's important.""

A final report with the panel's official recommendations is due by July 1 to the California Legislature, which will then decide whether to implement the measures and send them to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.

Newsom, a Democrat, signed a bill creating the task force amid the unrest following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He appointed the majority of the panel's nine members, one of whom are White.

Another task force member, Lisa Holder, president of the far-left Equal Justice Society, vowed in a recent opinion piece that the committee's ""recommendations will be breathtaking.""

According to California Justice Department officials, the law creating the task force did not instruct the committee to identify funding sources.

NEWSOM FALLS SILENT AFTER CALLS FOR HIM TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION ON REPARATIONS

""The task force is required by AB 3121 to recommend to the legislature methods for calculating reparations and the scope of reparations,"" Senior Assistant Attorney General Michael Newman previously told CalMatters. ""Based on their recommendations, the legislature is ultimately tasked with implementing these changes into law and figuring out how to pay for it.""

More recently, the panel's chair, Kamilah Moore, said last month it's up to the state legislature to determine a restitution amount based on the methodology economists recommended.

""The task force is pretty much done regarding the compensation component,"" she told KCRA. ""Our task was to create a methodology for calculation for various forms of compensation that correspond with our findings.""

MEET SOME OF THE CONTROVERSIAL INDIVIDUALS BEHIND SAN FRANCISCO'S $5M REPARATIONS PUSH: 'AMERICA, YOU OWE US'

At a recent in-person meeting of the task force, activists demanded California pay millions of dollars per Black resident in reparations, dismissing the idea of payments of $5 million per person as ""nothing"" and ""too little.""

The $5 million figure appeared to come from the city of San Francisco, which is currently weighing its own reparations proposals at the local level to pay that amount to qualifying Black residents.

Beyond the money, proponents of reparations are also seeking a range of other measures, including an apology letter from the state of California for past discrimination.

Colombia's Petro fires police chief who claims he used exorcisms to catch fugitives,"Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday removed the national police director who had talked about using exorcisms to catch fugitives.

Neither Petro nor the Defense Ministry elaborated on reasons for the dismissal of Gen. Henry Sanabria, a staunch Catholic who was appointed by Petro in August of last year. But Sanabria was under an internal investigation by the ministry over whether he had inappropriately allowed his religious beliefs to infringe on his duties.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES TRILATERAL DEAL WITH PANAMA AND COLOMBIA TO STOP DARIEN GAP MIGRATION

Sanabria had unleashed a debate about the impact of his faith on the police after his statements in an interview last month including that police had used exorcisms to catch drug kingpins and guerrilla leaders. He also issued a strong condemnation of abortion, which is legal in Colombia.

Although Colombia is a predominantly Catholic country of conservative and religious traditions, it is a secular state under its constitution. Petro, who was sworn in as the country’s first-ever leftist president last August, said that Sanabria would never be persecuted over his religion, but that there must be separation between religious beliefs and the state.

Interior Minister Alfonso Prada said Wednesday that Sanabria’s departure had nothing to do with his expressions of his religious beliefs, since the government respects freedom of thought. He said only that the dismissal was part of a new start for the national police force.

In a Twitter message, Petro thanked Sanabria for his work without referring to the reason for his removal.

Sanabria will be replaced by a retired general of the police force, William Salamanca, who currently is Colombia’s consul in Miami.

In an interview in Semana Magazine last month, Sanabria said that the police forces carried out exorcisms to catch top leaders of drug trafficking gangs and guerrilla groups.

He also spoke out strongly against abortion, which has been legalized in Colombia by the Constitutional Court since February of last year. Sanabria said that abortion is a ""very serious sin"" because it implies ""killing a little person who is being formed.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z
Buenos Aires locals bemoan homeless encampments overrunning major airport,"At the start of the long Easter weekend, the airport in Argentina’s capital is eerily quiet before dawn, hours before it will fill with travelers. About 100 people who sleep inside the facility are getting ready to start their day.

One of them is Ángel Gómez, who has been living in the Jorge Newbery International Airport for two years and has seen how the number of people joining him has soared.

""After the pandemic, this became a total invasion,"" Gómez said early Thursday as he sat next to a sign that advertised the Perito Moreno glacier, an iconic tourist attraction in Argentine Patagonia.

The airport, known colloquially as Aeroparque, has practically become a homeless shelter at night. It’s a stark reflection of the rising poverty in a country where some of the world’s highest inflation rates are making it difficult for many to make ends meet.

""If I pay rent I don’t eat, and if I pay for food I’m on the street,"" said Roxana Silva, who has been living at the airport with her husband, Gustavo Andrés Corrales, for two years.

Silva gets a government pension of around 45,000 pesos, which is equivalent to $213 at the official exchange rate and about half of that in the black market.

""I don’t have enough to live on,"" Silva laments, explaining that she and her husband take turns sleeping so that someone is always watching their stuff.

More and more Argentines are finding themselves in Silva’s situation, as the country’s inflation clocked in at an annual rate of 102.5% in February. Although Argentina has been used to double-digit inflation for years, this marked the first time the annual rise in consumer prices reached triple digits since 1991.

The high inflation, which has been especially pronounced in basic food items, has hit the poor the hardest and pushed the poverty rate to 39.2% of the population in the second half of 2022, an increase of three percentage points from the first six months of the year, according to Argentina’s national statistics agency, INDEC. Among children under age 15, the poverty rate increased more than three percentage points to 54.2%.

Horacio Ávila, who runs an organization devoted to helping homeless people, estimates the number of people without a roof in Argentina’s capital has soared 30 percent since 2019, when he and others carried out an unofficial count of 7,251 people in this city of around 3.1 million.

Amid the increased cost of living and diminishing purchasing power, more people started to look to the airport as a possible refuge.

Laura Cardoso has seen this increase firsthand in the year she has been living in the airport ""sleeping sitting up"" on her wheelchair.

""More people just came in,"" Cardoso said while accompanied by her two dogs that she says make it difficult for her to find a place to live because no one wants to rent to her. ""It’s packed with people.""

EL SALVADOR’S GANG CRACKDOWN STRETCHES TO ONE-YEAR MARK WITH NO SIGN OF SLOWING

Mirta Lanuara is a new arrival, living in the airport only about a week. She chose the airport because it’s clean.

Teresa Malbernat, 68, has been living in the airport for two months and says it’s safer than being in one of the city’s shelters, where she says she was robbed twice.

The Argentine company that operates the airport, AA2000, says it ""lacks police power"" and ""the authority to evict these people"" while also saying it has the obligation to ensure ""non-discrimination in the use of airport facilities.""

For Elizabet Barraza, 58, the sheer number of homeless people living in the airport illustrates why she’s choosing to emigrate to France, where one of her daughters has been living for five years.

""I’m going there because the situation here is difficult,"" Barraza said as she waited to board her flight. ""My salary isn’t enough to rent. Even if they increase the salaries, inflation is too high so it isn’t enough sometimes to rent and survive.""

the mobile air defense protecting Ukraine's skies at a moment's notice,"KYIV, Ukraine - Ihor’s comrades were eager to show us something special. A cone, the remnants of a Russian X-101 missile that didn’t make it to its final destination. The 23-year-old clean-shaven specialist grinned slightly, on his shoulder a soviet era Man-portable air-defense system (MANPAD). Ihor is the 1st Presidential Brigade MANPAD specialist.

After months of training, he was called in December for his first combat mission around Kyiv. When alerts sounded, indicating that a Russian missile or drone was inbound, his squad rushed into position.

When he spotted the missile in flight, Ihor fired the first shot he would ever fire in combat. There was a loud sizzle of a round leaving the MANPAD, followed by cheers from his fellow guardians of the sky.

""At first, I didn't understand anything, then I realized that this is my first rocket hit, and I was very happy."" He told us through an interpreter.

INSIDE THE MASSIVE OPERATION TO TRAIN THOUSANDS OF UKRAINE TROOPS AHEAD OF SPRING COUNTEROFFENSIVE

That X-101 is a personal trophy to him, but it also serves as a reminder to the squad of how important every little shot can be to preventing destruction of infrastructure, to protecting civilian lives. The Brigade has operated since 2014 when bitterness between Russian and Ukrainian loyalists boiled over to a civil conflict in the Donbas region.

Since the beginning of Russia’s full scale invasion, they’ve operated around Kyiv, taking part in the defense of city in the early days of the battles of Irpin, Bucha and Moschun. Under the command of the National Guard of Ukraine, they are on shift at all times, ready to jump into action as soon as the air raid sirens sound. They use a mix of Soviet and Western-provided technology, including Javelins, Stingers and MLAWS.

Mykhailo, is a gunner for the brigade. Originally from Luhansk, he has been a guardsman since 2014 and operates the ZU-23 barreled auto-cannon, a soviet era anti-air gun. The big gun is jury-rigged on the back of a flatbed truck. Mobility is an absolute necessity when they try to intercept the path of inbound warheads that can come from any direction.

""Currently, this weapon is effective for shooting down shaheeds, kamikaze drones. UAV kamikaze Shaheeds."" But there are limits, he told us. The old weapon will not be effective against helicopters or other Russian aircraft that don’t fly close enough to be in range of the old Soviet gun. ""These are outdated weapons, and we need something more modern and more technological""

WAIT IN LINE: RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER LEFT WAITING FOR VISA TO ENTER US AHEAD OF UN MEETING

To call the weapons ""outdated"" may only be scratching the surface. The ZU-23 he operates was made in the 1960s, and the MANPAD that Ihor uses is almost three times his age.

Leaked documents earlier this week from the Pentagon indicated that in late February, the Ukrainian air defense systems were set to begin running out by Mid-May. Ukraine relies heavily on these Soviet-era guns in their arsenal, and without them Russia would have an advantage on Ukrainian frontline positions and civilian targets

""The number of means that arrived from the West is not sufficient, and the number of rockets is certainly not sufficient. That is why we emphasize today that we need the missiles and air defense systems themselves, in order to replace the Soviet-made air defense systems,"" Said Col Yuriy Ignat, a spokesperson with the Ukraine Air Command ""After all, [if] these systems are destroyed and fail, we do not have spare parts, because all this equipment is produced in Russia, just like missiles. Therefore, the only way out for us is the transition to NATO standards and weapons samples.""

The U. S. has, since the end of February, seemed to recognize this weakness. The Biden administration last week authorized $2.6 billion in military assistance, which included air-defense munitions and systems such as National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS), three air surveillance radars and 30mm and 23mm anti-aircraft ammunition. Ukrainian troops have also completed training on the PATRIOT Missile Battery earlier this year.

But Ukraine has still not received any indication as to whether it will be provided with the prized goal of Western combat aircraft like the F-16, which would be a significant upgrade over their Mig-29 fighters. One Ukrainian combat pilot who spoke with Fox News with the call sign ""Moon Fish"" says the Mig-29s are just a stopgap.

""We are running low on the spare parts, on the armament, on the missiles. And overall, yes, it is a great boost. It is a great possibility to fill the gaps filled with fuel, fill up, from the losses. Together with that, It does not provide us with any sort of new capabilities that we desire.""

Despite old equipment, the 1st Presidential Brigade does not lack a sense of purpose. They know when the attack is launched, the mobile air defense volunteers are all that stands between a deadly inbound warhead and the people of Ukraine. ""It all depends on the gunner,"" says Mikhailo.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z

The team revealed its decision to not re-sign the team captain, making Thursday night's regular-season finale Toews' Chicago send-off.

After missing time due to chronic immune response syndrome and long COVID, the 34-year-old rejoined the team in early April.

Thursday will mark the end of Toews' 15th season in the league. He has not publicly mentioned retiring.

""I've had a number of conversations with Jonathan throughout the season about his future with the Blackhawks, and recently, we had the difficult conversation that we won't be re-signing him this offseason,"" Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said in a statement.

""Tonight will be his final game as a Blackhawk, and it was very important to us to be able to provide the proper send-off for Jonathan and our fans.""

The Blackhawks will welcome the Philadelphia Flyers to the United Center Thursday night. Chicago defeated Philly in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals with Toews receiving playoff MVP honors.

Toews entered the 2022-23 season on the final year of his eight-year, $84 million contract. In the 53 games he has played this season, he has recorded 14 goals and 16 assists.

Following a series of conversations, Davidson said he told Toews of the decision while the team was in Seattle last week. The GM also said he had talked to CEO Danny Wirtz, the son of Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz, about the move.

""Danny and Rocky spoke with Jonathan, not about this, just to kind of reminisce about what was lived and experienced and just to show that respect and share in the memories that were made together,"" Davidson said. ""So, when you're moving on from someone like Jonathan Toews, they have to be involved. They have to be, given the status and stature of the player.""

The Blackhawks selected Toews with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2006 NHL Draft. He became the team captain when he was just 20 years old in July 2008

Toews became a pivotal part of the 2010, 2013 and 2015 Stanley Cup championship teams. In 1,066 regular-season games, Toews has 371 goals and 511 assists. In 139 career playoff games, he has posted 45 goals and 74 assists.

People may still be able to access abortion pills if FDA loses US court battle,"* A separate federal judge in Washington issued an order to maintain mifepristone’s availability in contradiction to a Texas judge’s effort to suspend its approval

* The FDA could say it can’t satisfy both judgements, allowing the agency to preserve the status quo

* Because abortion pill mifepristone also has a strong safety record, the FDA would not be pressured to remove the abortion drug from the market

The U. S. Justice Department is racing this week to convince a federal appeals court, or possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, to put on hold a judge's order suspending the government's approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, which is used in more than half of all abortions in the country.

But even if those legal efforts fail and last Friday's order by U. S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas goes into effect, essentially rendering the drug unapproved, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could nonetheless continue to allow access to the drug, legal experts say.

The FDA, responsible for protecting public health by assuring safety, efficacy and security of drugs, is also facing an order issued minutes later on Friday by a separate federal judge in Washington state, barring the federal agency from changing the availability of mifepristone.

PRO-LIFE REPUBLICANS SAY FDA APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL WAS ILLEGAL, ASK APPEALS COURT TO UPHOLD INJUNCTION

The contradictory rulings may give the FDA reason to preserve the status quo while the government's appeal proceeds and declare that drug companies and doctors won't face legal risks for making or prescribing mifepristone, experts said.

""One way in which the FDA could comply with this is to do nothing, to use its enforcement discretion to say we can't satisfy both judgments,"" said Rachel Rebouche, dean of the Temple University Beasley School of Law.

The FDA can demand that manufacturers remove unapproved drugs from the market and if a manufacturer fails to comply, the agency can take the drugmaker to court.

But the agency also has to make best use of its resources and has a history of not taking action when there is low risk to the public. The FDA has estimated that there are thousands of drug products marketed illegally without agency approval, including those that were available prior to the passage of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938.

In 2011, the agency issued guidance for prioritizing action against unapproved drugs and said it would focus on those that present potential safety risks, are ineffective, are fraudulent, or are formulated to avoid FDA enforcement.

The FDA, which has said it stands behind it determination that mifepristone is safe and effective, declined to comment.

Sources told Reuters the Biden administration is planning steps to support mifepristone manufacturers.

The FDA approved mifepristone, which is the first of a two-drug regimen to terminate a pregnancy within the first 10 weeks, in 2000.

On Friday, Kacsmaryk suspended FDA approval of mifepristone in response to a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion groups claiming that the agency approved the drug using an unlawful process and did not adequately consider its safety. Minutes later, U. S. District Judge Thomas Rice in Spokane, Washington, blocked the FDA from making any changes to the current availability of the drug. His ruling applies in the 17 states and the District of Columbia that sued the government seeking to loosen the special safety restrictions around the pill.

Both rulings apply while the cases proceed, and are not on the merits of each case.

Kacsmaryk put his ruling on hold until Friday to give the Biden administration, which supports access to abortion, time to pursue its appeal.

SCHUMER SAYS JUDGE'S MIFEPRISTONE ABORTION PILL RULING ‘COULD THROW OUR COUNTRY INTO CHAOS’

But, even if the abortion pill's approval remains suspended, the FDA has precedent on its side to do nothing, legal experts said.

""They don't have to drop everything and remove mifepristone from the market,"" said Evan Bernick, a professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law. ""They haven't done that with other drugs, they've prioritized on the basis of safety risk, and mifepristone has a strong safety record.""

Forty years ago, prison inmates sentenced to death by injection sued the FDA because the agency refused to prevent the administration of certain drugs in executions, which allegedly violated their approved use.

The case, known as Heckler v Chaney, found its way to the Supreme Court which ruled unanimously in 1985 that judges should not review the FDA's decisions about allocating resources.

""I would hope the administration would recognize this as an opportunity to do what they have been saying they would do, which is take all steps available to them to maintain access to this drug,"" said Phil Katz, an attorney for mifepristone maker Danco Laboratories, which is also appealing the Texas ruling.

An attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which represented the plaintiffs in the Texas case, said if Kacsmaryk's ruling takes effect manufacturers cannot make mifepristone and it would be ""extremely dangerous"" for the FDA to suggest otherwise.

""The whole problem here is that FDA didn't follow regulations and rulemaking in the first place,"" Denise Harle said.

Kacsmaryk briefly discussed the 1985 case in his Friday ruling, saying the FDA ""cannot shield their decisions from judicial review merely by characterizing the challenged action as exercising 'enforcement discretion'.""

Rebouche said she did not think Kacsmaryk's discussion of the 1985 case had any bearing on the FDA's authority.

""The FDA’s enforcement discretion is established by prior precedent,"" Rebouche said. ""That case law would have to be overturned, which is not impossible but would be a major upending of federal agency authority.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
California woman kidnapped in Mexico seen in video footage 'moments before' disappearance,"The FBI has released video footage of missing California woman Monica De Leon Barba ""moments before"" she was kidnaped in Tepatitlán, Jalisco, Mexico.

De Leon Barba, a 29-year-old U. S. citizen, was last seen walking her dog on Nov. 29, 2022, around 5 p.m. before she was pulled into a van.

""The FBI is requesting the public's assistance in locating Monica and returning her safely to her family. We believe these videos may have generated new public tips to assist in our investigation,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Robert Tripp said in a Thursday afternoon statement.

Tripp told FOX 2 San Francisco that the FBI ""believes this was a targeted kidnapping.""

""We believe she is still being held hostage. The hostage takers have been in contact with her family and the FBI is working very closely with her family and with authorities in Mexico to bring her home safely,"" Tripp told the outlet.

Three vehicles are seen fleeing from the scene of her kidnapping in the FBI footage.

The FBI is offering a reward of up to $40,000 for information leading to De Leon Barba's whereabouts.

De Leon Barba was headed to a nearby gym when the kidnapping occurred, her family wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to the missing woman titled, ""Help Us Find Monica De Leon.""

A State Department spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital that the agency and its embassies and consulates abroad ""have no greater responsibility than the protection of U. S. citizens overseas"" in response to a request for comment regarding De Leon's disappearance.

Former British PM blames 'woke culture' for Western economic woes,"Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss’ speech to an American think tank on Wednesday will slam ""woke culture,"" among other factors, for economic troubles in the U. K. and U.S.

""The sad truth is that we have seen stagnation, redistributionism and woke culture taking hold in businesses and the economy in the U. K. and the U.S.,"" Truss said in pre-release remarks ahead of her speech to the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C. ""It results in more tax, more subsidies, more regulation.""

She will also argue that Britain and America must look to ""rediscover trade and reject protectionism"" and work together to combat the increasing cooperation between ""dictatorships.""

Truss spent only 49 days in office as the shortest-reigning British prime minister after her mini-budget proposal was shot down due to controversy of over her plan to cut taxes. The lack of clarity on where the funding for the cuts would come from led to economic turmoil, forcing Truss to resign.

During her speech, Truss plans to stick to her economic and political ideals: She will urge a clear need for Western nations to work together to combat the threats of China and Russia – especially concerning the safety of Taiwan, which plays a significant role in the production of semiconductor chips and therefore the global economy.

Truss will suggest that economic weakness has helped authoritarian regimes, accusing ""too many in the West"" of appeasing and accommodating the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""Putin and Xi have made it clear they are allies against Western capitalism,"" Truss will say. ""That is why Western leaders visiting President Xi to ask for his support in ending the war is a mistake, and it is a sign of weakness.""

The ""weakness,"" she claims, has also allowed ""our opponents"" to ""own our institutions, crowd our campuses and fill our airwaves"" as the U. S. and U.K. shifted away from ""absolute bastions of free enterprise, free markets and free speech"" to ""self-flagellation.""

Gavin Newsom's office fails to provide proof of Florida college book ban claimed by California governor,"California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom took aim at a Florida college that he called ""ground zero"" for what Republicans want to do to education nationwide.

The progressive champion singled out the Sarasota-based New College of Florida, whose board of trustees was revamped by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a Wednesday message to his 2 million Twitter followers. Newsom said the institution is banning books, among other allegations of limiting speech.

""Last week, I went to New College in Florida – ground zero for what the [Republicans] are trying to do to education in this country,"" Newsom said on Wednesday.

""Take a moment to watch this. Books are banned. Speech is limited. Faculty are scared. Students are bullied. This is just a small dose of what's to come.""

GAVIN NEWSOM'S WIFE PUSHED FOR STATE FUNDING THAT BENEFITS HER OWN NONPROFIT

Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom's office asking them to provide a list of the alleged banned books at the institution. However, they failed to do so and did not respond to the inquiry.

Newsom's attacks further add to the speculation he may be exploring a future presidential run. DeSantis, also a likely presidential contender, appointed six members to New College of Florida's board of trustees in January. The college has since taken a rightward turn in pushing back against educational policies, including abolishing its diversity office.

GAVIN NEWSOM'S WIFE'S FILMS SHOWN IN SCHOOLS CONTAIN SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IMAGES, PUSH GENDER IDEOLOGY, BOOST HIS POLITICS

Meanwhile, one of the college's DeSantis-appointed trustees, Christopher Rufo, responded to Newsom's message by saying he's spreading falsehoods.

""Gavin Newsom is spreading lies and falsely claiming that 'books are banned' at New College of Florida,"" Rufo said. ""He wants to put all Americans under the boot of DEI commissars and California's failed policies.""

Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, later said that Newsom visited the college to ""spread lies about Ron DeSantis' higher-education reforms"" and that ""no amount of hair gel"" could stop them from ""restoring classical liberal arts education in Florida.""

During Newsom's visit, he met with students and faculty who were reportedly upset with the school's current trajectory, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

""I'm crawling out of my skin for you guys,"" Newsom said during his visit. ""I want you to know you're not alone. You matter, we care. This is the 'why I'm here.' I'm not your governor. But I'm a member of the larger community all bound together.""

"Hundreds of US drugmakers, including Pfizer, call for reversal of sales suspension of abortion pill","Over 300 biotech and pharmaceutical industry executives, including Pfizer Inc CEO Albert Bourla, signed an open letter on Monday calling for reversal of a federal judge's decision to suspend sales of the abortion pill mifepristone.

A U. S. judge on Friday suspended the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's two-decade-old approval of the drug, effectively banning sales while a case brought by anti-abortion groups before him continues in the Northern District of Texas.

Last week's ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk undermines the FDA's authority, the letter's authors wrote, adding that it ignores decades of scientific evidence and legal precedent.

""We call for the reversal of this decision to disregard science, and the appropriate restitution of the mandate for the safety and efficacy of medicines for all with the FDA, the agency entrusted to do so in the first place,"" they wrote.

Bourla was the first leader of a major pharmaceutical company to add his name to the letter, which also bore the signatures of more than 300 executives from smaller U. S. biotechnology companies.

The letter was written by ReCode Therapeutics CEO Shehnaaz Suliman, Blackfynn co-founder Amanda Banks, and Ovid Therapeutics CEO Jeremy Levin, who is also a former chairman of biotech industry lobbying group BIO.

The decision puts the entire industry at risk, the letter says, and sets a precedent for undermining the agency's authority to approve drugs, adding regulatory uncertainty that they warned would disincentivize investment in new treatments.

""You have the real potential of having medicines not being developed because it's far too expensive, or medicines that are currently approved being withdrawn because they are political,"" Levin told Reuters.

The FDA approved mifepristone, part of a two-drug regimen that accounts for more than half of U. S. abortions, more than 20 years ago and has determined its safety several times since.

Health policy and legal experts have said that if Kacsmaryk's unprecedented ruling is allowed to stand it could undermine confidence in FDA's authority to regulate drugs, severely weaken the agency, and hinder access to new treatments.

""If courts can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone,"" the letter said.

The ruling could open the possibility to the banning of vaccines and contraception for women, said Levin.

""This is a nightmare scenario for the industry,"" he said. ""It's the single worst threat to the industry in over 50 years.""",2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z

"Tim Scott supports national 20-week abortion ban, would consider 15-week limit","EXCLUSIVE – Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said there’s ""no question"" he would support a 20-week federal ban on abortion and would potentially consider a 15-week limit.

Scott, a rising star in the GOP and the only Black Republican in the Senate, made news early Thursday in New Hampshire as he told local TV station WMUR that if elected president, he would support a 20-week ban on abortion. He reiterated that position a couple of hours later in an interview with Fox News at a café in Manchester — the state’s most populous city — but went a step further.

""At least 20 weeks. There’s no question that I think the 15 weeks — there’s a lot of reasons for us to understand that, the viability,"" Scott told Fox News on his second day of campaigning in the crucial early presidential nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire after launching a presidential exploratory committee.

Abortion, always an important issue on the campaign trail, took center stage following the blockbuster move last June by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority to overturn the landmark nearly half-century old Roe v. Wade ruling, which allowed for legalized abortions nationwide. The decision by the high court moved the divisive issue of abortion back to the states. Last year, following the Supreme Court ruling, Scott’s GOP colleague from South Carolina, Sen. Lindsey Graham, proposed a 15-week federal ban on abortions.

FIRST ON FOX NEW: SEN. TIM SCOTT ANNOUNCES PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE

""There’s no question that the health of the child, the viability of the child, 20 weeks in my opinion is a no question. But the 15-week threshold is something that I believe is a place where you find a national limit that says ‘no more.’ States can do less. That’s got to be a state’s opportunity to do what they want to do.""

Taking questions from reporters after a stop at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, a longtime must stop for White House hopefuls from both major political parties, Scott criticized Democrats for being hypocrites on the abortion issue and took aim at Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for suggesting at a Senate Banking hearing that participation in the workforce by African American women in poverty could be increased by having abortions.

TIM SCOTT TAKING NEXT STEPS AS GOP SENATOR MOVES TOWARDS 2024 RUN

""The most egregious form of restrictions are the lack of restrictions that our friends on the other side of the aisle have been voting for. They voted for late-term abortions up until the time of birth,"" Scott argued in his Fox News interview.

The senator charged that ""the most egregious form of this conversation gets so little coverage and so there’s no doubt that we have to find a threshold where we know that while the issue allows the states to be as aggressive or permissive as they want to be, I think there is the need for some kind of threshold that says we’re going to limit access to abortions for x number of weeks because we continue to see the rise of the far radical left wanting abortions up to the day of birth.""

And he emphasized that ""we can’t be a country aligned with North Korea and China,"" which allow abortions for any reasons even after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Scott, who’s co-sponsored restrictive abortions bills during his tenure in the Senate, including the 2021 Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which called for jail time for physicians who perform abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The senator, who’s reiterated when asked about abortion that he’s ""100% pro-life,"" on Thursday declined to answer when asked whether he would support legislation to prosecute doctors who performed late-term abortions.

Speaking with reporters, Scott declined to weigh in on whether medication abortions should remain legal, in the wake ruling this week by a federal appeals court that preserved access to the abortion pill mifepristone for now reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used, and said it could not be dispensed by mail. The Justice Department says it will ask the Supreme Court for an emergency order to put any action on hold.

""The courts are on their way to solving the problem,"" Scott said.

WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Democrats spent millions attacking Republicans over abortion ahead of last year’s midterm elections, and it was a contributing factor in turning the hoped for red wave by Republicans into a trickle. Democrats increased their razor-thin Senate majority by one seat, and while they lost control of the House, they kept their losses to a minimum. Democrats also won a number of crucial gubernatorial contests and flipped a handful of GOP controlled state house chambers. And Democrats last week won a crucial state supreme court election in battleground Wisconsin — where abortion was a top issue — by double digits.

On the eve of Scott's visit, longtime New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley emphasized to reporters that the senator ""has supported some of the most extreme anti-choice legislation in Congress, including national abortion bans and legislation that could pave the way for banning forms of birth control.""

Scott has long highlighted his faith and has been a champion to social conservative voters, who overwhelming oppose abortion rights. He’s likely to heavily court evangelical voters, who play an outsized role in Republican politics in Iowa and his home state of South Carolina, which votes third in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

Among his stops on Wednesday in Iowa was a roundtable discussion with homeschool families. And following his visit to the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, New Hampshire, Scott privately met with a group of pastors.

Asked if that’s his path to victory in the GOP nomination race, Scott told Fox News: ""I think my path to victory is just talking to people about commonsense. Commonsense conservatism works in New Hampshire as much as it does in South Carolina.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Germany allows Poland to give Ukraine 5 old MiG-29 fighter jets,"Germany has approved Poland's request to export five old MiG-29 fighter jets to bolster Ukraine's air power against the Russian invasion, the German defense ministry said on Thursday.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said the request had arrived Thursday, and that Berlin's same-day approval showed that Germany could be relied upon.

Germany inherited 24 MiG-29 jets from the East German GDR during reunification in 1990. At the time, the aircraft were seen as among the most advanced fighter jets in the world.

In 2004, Berlin passed on 22 of the aircraft to Poland. Of the remaining two jets, one was destroyed in a crash and one is on show at a museum.

"Get Temu, the popular shopping app, off your phone now","Seemingly overnight, everyone’s talking about Temu, an online shopping app full of deals that seem too good to be true. You’ll find $17 wireless earbuds, $1 ""gold"" necklaces and $23 wedding dresses.

No wonder Temu is the most popular shopping app in the U. S., behind only Amazon. But most of us know little about the app's origins. Like these apps, it’s tied to China.

I did some digging into whether it’s safe to use. Here’s what I found.

I share important security updates every weekday straight to your inbox. Join 400K+ happy subscribers. (It's free!)

This app isn't some fly-by-night operation. Temu (pronounced ""tee-moo"") is based in Boston, Massachusetts, by PDD Holdings Inc. PDD is headquartered in Shanghai, China. PDD also owns the e-commerce platform Pinduoduo headquartered in — you guessed it — China. (More on Pinduoduo and its shady app below.)

IS THIS CHINESE-BASED SHOPPING APP SPYING ON YOU?

Over 50 million Americans have downloaded Temu since it launched state-side in September 2022. You might remember its expensive Super Bowl ads promising to let you ""shop like a billionaire.""

Searches for terms like ""Is Temu legit"" surged once Americans saw just how cheap the prices are. Not surprisingly, you get what you pay for.

First, you're buying goods directly from manufacturers in China and other parts of the world. That's why shipping times are often much longer than on sites like Amazon. You might get your stuff in a week, but that could be more like 12 days.

For the most part, the prices are low because the goods are cheap. The pictures of what you see advertised may not be what you actually get.

Online reviewers seem to agree: Cheap is nice, but not when the quality is too shoddy to use. Temu’s BBB rating is 2.21/5. Reviews at TrustPilot are interesting, with 38% 5-star reviews and 41% 1-star reviews.

But that’s not the worst of it. As you shop, Temu collects lots of information.

Security boost: Simple mistake making your computer slower and less safe

Temu isn’t unique in all the info it wants to capture from your phone, of course. Most apps out there want as much as you’ll give up. But considering its ties to Communist China, the permissions seem even more frightening to me.

* The info you provide, like your name, address, and phone number.

* Details you enter, like your birthday, photo, and social media profiles.

* Your phone or computer’s operating system and version, your IP address, GPS location (if you allowed it), and browsing data.

They also gather more about you from third-party sources, including Temu sellers, public records, social media, data brokers, credit bureaus, and marketing partners.

Americans using Temu are selling the country out for bargains that really aren’t worth it. I say you delete it. Here’s how:

On iPhone, Long-press an app, then tap Remove App > Delete App. Tap Delete to confirm.

On Android, touch and hold an app, then tap Remove App > Delete App > Delete.

Still have TikTok on your phone? Here’s why it’s more complicated than fun viral videos.

While Temu collects a lot, it’s nothing compared to Pinduoduo. Remember, they are owned by the same company.

Cybersecurity researchers found it wasn’t just tracking device info and activity – malicious code allowed it to bypass cellphone security settings to spy on other apps, read notifications and messages, and even change settings.

PUTIN AND XI SEEK TO WEAPONIZE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AGAINST AMERICA

Temu gains full access to all your contacts, calendars, and photo albums, plus all your social media accounts, chats, and texts. In other words, literally everything on your phone.

Why? Company insiders told CNN that it’s a way to spy on users and competitors to boost sales.

No shopping app needs this much control, especially one tied to Communist China. If you’re using Pinduoduo, delete the app from your phone ASAP. It’s also reportedly hard to remove everything, even after you delete it.

Pro tip: If you downloaded Pinduoduo you really need to do a full factory reset on your smartphone to wipe out any remaining code or tracking.

Missouri theme park implements new rule after massive brawl erupts involving more than 150 teens,"An amusement park in Missouri established a chaperone policy after a fight involving 100 to 150 teenagers broke out over the weekend, requiring law enforcement to help break it up.

The Clay County Sheriff's Office said in a press release that the teenagers were involved in a fight at the Worlds of Fun amusement park in Kansas City, Missouri, on Saturday.

In a Wednesday announcement, Worlds of Fun announced it would be implementing a chaperone policy, requiring all people ages 15 or younger must be with a person who is at least 21 in order to ""be admitted to, or remain in, the park after 4:00 p.m.""

""For decades, Worlds of Fun has been a place where families and friends come together to enjoy our one-of-a-kind park. Millions of guests have counted on us for their daily dose of wholesome family fun, and we’re committed to keeping that promise going forward,"" a statement along with the policy states.

The new chaperone policy will go into effect on Saturday.

Off-duty deputies and park security officers worked with the Kansas City Police Department worked to move the teenagers out of the park.

One teenage girl refused to leave the park and punched a deputy in the face, leaving the law enforcement official with ""superficial injuries,"" according to the press release.

Birth rate in Italy hits record low in 2022 as population continues to shrink,"Births in Italy dropped to a new historic low below 400,000 in 2022, national statistics bureau ISTAT said on Friday, as the population continued to shrink.

Italy's death of babies is considered a national emergency, and fixing the problem was a prominent policy pledge by Giorgia Meloni ahead of last year's election which saw her become the country's first woman prime minister.

Last year Italy recorded more than 12 deaths for every seven births and the resident population fell by 179,000 to 58.85 million, ISTAT said in its annual demographic report.

FORMER ITALIAN PREMIER SILVIO BERLUSCONI SAYS HE'LL 'ONCE AGAIN' RECOVER FOLLOWING LEUKEMIA DIAGNOSIS

The population decline slowed somewhat compared with 2021 and 2020, two years heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Italy recorded 392,600 births in 2022, down from 400,249 the previous year, ISTAT said, the 14th consecutive fall and the lowest number since the country's unification in 1861.

""A major factor is the reduction and the ageing of the female population in the 15-49 age group conventionally considered reproductive,"" the institute said in a note.

POPE FRANCIS WON'T PRESIDE OVER GOOD FRIDAY'S LATE-NIGHT WAY OF THE CROSS EVENT DUE TO COLD WEATHER IN ROME

The fertility rate edged down to 1.24 children per woman from 1.25 in 2021, registering a decline in central and northern regions and a marginal increase in the south.

The trend was partly offset by immigration, with immigrants exceeding emigrants by 229,000 last year compared with a net inflow of 160,000 in 2021. Foreigners made up 8.6% of the country's population in 2022, for a total of 5.05 million.

Italy's overall population has been falling steadily since 2014, with a cumulative loss since then of more than 1.36 million people, equivalent to the residents of Milan, the country's second biggest city.

ISTAT predicted in September that Italy could lose almost a fifth of its residents, with the population set to decline, under a baseline scenario, to 54.2 million in 2050 and 47.7 million in 2070.

In its latest report, ISTAT said one in four people in Italy is above the age of 65, while the number of centenarians has tripled to 22,000 over the last 20 years.

Life expectancy at birth stood at 82.6 in 2022, with people in wealthy central and northern regions living longer than those in poorer southern ones.

Overall, men born in Italy can expect to live to 80 years and six months, and women until almost 85.",2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z
"Texas man who spit at police sees 'life of crime' crumble, slapped with 70 years in prison to 'send a message'","A Texas man convicted of spitting at Lubbock police officers back in May 2022 was sentenced to 70 years in prison on Wednesday, according to reports

KLBK-TV in Lubbock, Texas, reported that police arrested 36-year-old Larry Pearson in May 2022 for domestic violence.

Prosecuting attorney Jessica Gorman told the station Pearson was arrested after the victim flagged down a Lubbock Police Department officer.

Pearson’s charges were based on allegations that he hit a woman multiple times in the face and left here with visible injuries.

After Pearson was arrested and placed in a patrol vehicle, the station reported, he got angry because the victim was not arrested, then began kicking the door of the cruiser.

When the officers opened the door and told Pearson to stop, he spat at them and continued to do so after he arrived at the Lubbock County Detention Center.

Pearson was ultimately found guilty by a jury of two counts of harassment of a public servant.

Gorman, who did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital regarding the sentencing, asked the jury to ""send a message"" to Pearson and society when considering a number to attach to the sentence.

The prosecutor said the minimum Pearson would face was 25 years in prison because he had been convicted previously of aggravated robbery and family violence.

Pearson’s attorney, Jim Shaw, told jurors the sentencing was for a ""simple misdemeanor"" that had gotten out of control.

As it turned out, the jury slapped Pearson with a 70-year sentence.

Gorman told KLBK-TV that a 70-year sentence would not be handed down to someone for something like this if they have never been in trouble with the law before.

Missouri Republican lawmaker clarifies comments about 12-year-olds getting married,"A Missouri Republican state lawmaker on Tuesday said children as young as 12 years old should be able to get married as he defended a proposed bill banning gender-affirming care for minors.

Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, sat before a panel on Tuesday to defend and debate a bill that would ban all gender transition procedures for anyone under the age of 18.

The bill passed the Missouri Senate in March and is now before the House.

During the questioning, Rep. Peter Meredith, a Democrat, called Moon out for his stance on marriage of 12-year-olds if parental consent were given.

""You voted ‘no’ on making it illegal for kids to be married to adults at the age of 12 if their parents consented to it,"" Meredith said to Moon. ""You said, actually, that should be the law because it’s the parents’ right and the kid’s right to decide what’s best for them. To be raped by an adult.""

Moon did not deny supporting the measure. In fact, he defended it, to a degree.

""Do you know any kids who have been married at age 12?"" he asked Meredith.

""I don’t need to,"" Meredith said.

""I do,"" Moon said. ""And guess what? They’re still married.""

Video of the senator making the statements made the rounds on social media, catching the eye of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who tweeted about them on Wednesday.

RACHEL LEVINE'S CLAIM ALL AGREE ON ‘GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE’ IS SLAMMED BY DOCTORS ‘IN HIDING’

""Meanwhile, in Missouri: State Senator Mike Moon is advocating for 12-year-old kids to be married off to adults,"" Newsom tweeted.

Moon retweeted Newsom’s post with a statement of his own.

""To be clear, I did not advocate for minors to be married off to adults,"" he tweeted, directing followers to a video he made to help clear the air. ""Keep your California politics out of Missouri. Democrats will say whatever they can to make sure they can keep mutilating children.""

A spokesman for Moon spoke to Fox News Digital on Thursday, who said the one-hour committee meeting had strict time constraints and the senator did not have time to clear up his comments before Meredith moved on to the next.

KANSAS SCHOOL DISTRICT: GENDER IDENTITY CAN BE KEPT FROM PARENTS, AVOIDING PREFERRED PRONOUNS CAN CAUSE DEATH

Had he been given the time, the spokesman explained, Moon would have clarified he did not support 12-year-old children getting married to adults.

Moon does support, though, 12-year-olds getting married to people closer in age, like another 12-year-old.

During the debate, Moon said he knew kids who were 12 years old when they got married. According to the spokesman, one of the 12-year-olds got pregnant, and the parents encouraged them to get married.

The two children got married but were raised in two different states. Once they became adults, the spokesman said, they got back together, and they have been happily married ever since.

When asked how old the married couple is today, the spokesman said they are in their 50s.

Moon also addressed the issue on YouTube on Thursday.

US works with allies abroad to develop semiconductor policies,"As the United States works to ramp up semiconductor production domestically, lawmakers are also heading overseas to work with allies abroad.

""In today's interconnected world, we cannot wall ourselves off from shared problems. We are stronger and better when we work together,"" President Biden said on a trip to Mexico City earlier this year. ""We’re working to strengthen our cooperation on supply chains and critical minerals so we can continue to accelerate in our efforts to build the technologies of tomorrow right here in North America.""

Biden met with Mexican President Manuel Lopez Obrador and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the North American Leaders’ Summit in January. They discussed a variety of issues, including ramping up semiconductor production throughout North America.

""Economic policy is climate policy is security policy,"" Trudeau said. ""With growing competition, including from an increasingly assertive China, there's no doubt why it matters that we turn to each other now to build up a North American market on everything from semiconductors to solar panel batteries.""

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE GLOBAL CHIP SHORTAGE?

Canada plans to spend $240 million to expand its chip manufacturing. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said during a trip to Mexico in September that the benefits of the CHIPS Act will not be limited to just the U. S.

""These investments are going to create jobs and opportunities for Mexican workers and businesses,"" Raimondo said. ""I’m especially pleased that the CHIPS and Science Act includes funding that will help us work with partner countries to strengthen our semiconductor supply chains.""

Ongoing discussions between the North American leaders have shown that getting Mexico onboard with ramping up production has been challenging. The U. S. and Canada have aimed to increase green energy output to help run fabrication plants. President Obrador has been slow to abandon his energy policy, which has benefited state-run electric companies in favor of adding more renewable sources.

""We think consultations have helped clarify both the nature of U. S. concerns, have identified some potential pathways forward, but we're not there yet,"" National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in January.

Climate envoy John Kerry met with Mexican leaders in March to discuss a possible $5 billion investment in a solar energy farm near Arizona. Mexican officials have said the site will send power north across the border to help run the state’s semiconductor hub. Manufacturers believe transitioning to more renewable resources is important for the future of the industry.

""I think energy and the availability of electrical power is an issue for our industry,"" GlobalFoundries CEO Thomas Caulfield said. ""Our industry uses a lot of energy, and we need to lead the effort to make sure we're using it from greener sources over time.""

U. S. NEEDS TO STOP CHINA AND HERE ARE THE BEST WAYS TO DO IT

It’s unclear if the U. S. will help with the additional funding. Kerry is expected to return to the country for further discussions this year.

Semiconductor Industry Association President and CEO John Neuffer said it's important for the U. S. to work with allies around the world to generate more chips manufacturing.

""Our goal is not to totally onshore our supply chain. It's too big, too sophisticated. We can't do it all at home,"" Neuffer said. ""We must also work with global partners to increase production, partners like Mexico and Canada, like-minded economies in Southeast Asia and in Europe to reinforce our global supply chain.""

Many countries are joining together to compete against China. U. S. officials have met with Dutch and Japanese counterparts to discuss possible export controls on Chinese semiconductor manufacturing. The Biden administration put its own restrictions in place last year. But for those to be effective, officials said they wanted a top European producer in the Netherlands and a leading Asian producer in Japan to join in.

""If we try to put controls on ourselves, our non-Chinese competitors can fill in the holes, Neuffer said. ""Then, you get harm to U. S. companies, and you don't get a national security priority taking care of it.""

Japan and the Netherlands reportedly agreed to join the U. S. effort in January, but little is known about the specific details.

HOUSE CHINA COMMITTEE: CARGO CRANES GIVE CHINA A TOOL TO DISRUPT TRADE, MILITARY MOBILIZATION AT US PORTS

""We talked about a lot of things, but a lot of it is private,"" Biden told reporters after the meetings.

China is the fifth leading semiconductor producer in the world. South Korea, Japan and the U. S. all make more. But it is China’s aggression toward the world’s top manufacturer in Taiwan that has many around the world concerned.

""They've made some indications that they want to pull back Taiwan,"" Sen. Mark Kelly D-Ariz., said. ""They make the best microelectronics in the world, the best semiconductor chips. If we lose access to that, the estimate is that, in a couple in a couple of years, we would lose up to 10% of our GDP.""

Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., said China has wanted to develop high-tech products while cutting off other countries from accessing that technology.

""The Chinese are trying to weaponize our economic interdependence with their country,"" Young said on ""Special Report"" in January. ""Cutting off imports of various things, disrupting supply chains. We can't allow them to do that with a mission-critical component like a semiconductor.""

Some companies design their own chips but use Taiwanese manufacturing to produce the semiconductors. If Taiwan is cut off from contributing to global supply, it could hurt businesses outsourcing their practices.

U. S. FOREIGN POLICY 'PARALYSIS' ALLOWED CHINA OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE PATH TO 'TOP SUPERPOWER': EXPERTS

""It’s about 30% cheaper to make them in Taiwan as opposed to the United States,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said. ""So it's a great business model for them, but it's a huge national security and economic vulnerability for the United States.""

Some companies have also cut ties to China. GlobalFoundries decided against opening a fabrication plant there in 2018.

""Part of that pivot of the company was to abandon our plans to expand manufacturing in China,"" Caulfield said. ""I think it's a reality. As business leaders, we don't get to set the rules of the playing field, but it's our job to deal with those issues.""

Most lawmakers and experts agree that staying a step ahead of China when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing is crucial.

""The countries that have enough chips are the ones that will lead in technology, and the countries that lead in technology are going to be the winners will be the strongest,"" Raimondo said on ""Special Report"" in February. ""It’s very definitely true that for America to maintain its global leadership position, we have to lead in tech and innovation, and investing in chips is necessary to do that.""

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said the CHIPS Act is a good start when it comes to competing with China but also warned that manufacturing overall needs to increase in the U. S.

""The bulk of the production for the chips that go into our consumer products, our cars, our dishwashers, our dryers, our refrigerators are still not produced in the United States,"" Khanna said. ""I don't want a situation where the advanced chips are made in America, but everything consumers buy is made in China. So we need to do a lot more.""",2023-04-05T00:00:00.000Z
UN agrees to hear century-old Venezuela-Guyana border dispute case,"The United Nations' highest court ruled Thursday that it can hear a case between South American neighbors Guyana and Venezuela about a border dispute that dates back to 1899.

The decision to reject Venezuela's challenge to the case's admissibility means it will go ahead at the International Court of Justice, though will likely take years to resolve.

The ruling was a second defeat for Venezuela's attempts to have the case tossed out. It came more than two years after judges rejected a challenge by Caracas to the world court's jurisdiction.

In the admissibility challenge rejected Thursday, Venezuela had argued that the court could not hear the case without the involvement of the United Kingdom, which was Guyana's colonial master at the time of the original border decision. The Guyanese side had argued that Britain ceased to have any involvement in the case once Guyana gained its independence in 1966 and that Venezuela was using its argument as a delay tactic.

Guyana President Irfaan Ali welcomed Thursday's ruling and underlined his country's commitment to resolving the dispute peacefully.

""Guyana remains confident that its longstanding international boundary with Venezuela will be confirmed by the court,"" Ali said in a statement.

INDIAN ARMY GENERAL SAYS SITUATION ON BORDER WITH CHINA IS 'UNPREDICTABLE'

The territorial dispute dates back to an arbitration award by an international tribunal in 1899 that drew the border between the two South American nations largely to the favor of Guyana, which was then a British colony. The Tunisia-sized swath of jungle west of the Essequibo river in the dispute is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources.

Guyana took the case to the world court in 2018 after years of fruitless mediation failed to resolve the dispute. In its case, Guyana asks the court to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding on both countries.

California man gets year in jail for threatening Merriam-Webster Dictionary publisher,"A California man who made violent anti-LGBTQ-related threats against dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster Inc. over its updated gender definitions was sentenced Thursday to a year in prison.

The sentence imposed on Jeremy Hanson, 35, by a federal court in Massachusetts also included 30 days of home confinement, three years of probation and mental health treatment.

Hanson pleaded guilty last year to interstate transmission of threatening communications in connection with threats made to the Springfield, Massachusetts-based dictionary publisher and to the president of the University of North Texas.

In court documents, prosecutors said the Rossmoor, California, man has a history of making ""threatening communications, nearly all of which were motivated by ... biases based upon race, gender, gender identity, and/or sexual orientation.""

Those other communications were directed at the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Land O’ Lakes Inc., Hasbro, a nonbinary rabbi and others, prosecutors said.

In a remote hearing Thursday, prosecutor Steven Breslow asked for an 18-month prison sentence, in part to serve as a deterrent to others at a time when violent rhetoric is becoming more common.

Hanson’s defense attorney, Marissa Elkins, asked that her client be sentenced to the time he has already served, citing his history of emotional and behavioral issues, including anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

More time behind bars could negatively affect his mental health, she said.

Judge Mark Mastroianni in U. S District Court in Springfield acknowledged Hanson's medical history and said he had no intent or capacity to carry out his threats, but called his actions ""disturbing and terrifying.""

He noted that Merriam-Webster management was ""fearful that Hanson would come to their office and cause harm,"" and said internal company communications referenced the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo offices in France, where terrorists killed 12 people who worked for the satirical weekly newspaper.

Hanson sent Merriam-Webster threatening messages and comments between Oct. 2 and Oct. 8, 2021 using the website’s ""contact us"" function, where he commented on word entries such as ""girl,"" ""woman,"" and ""female,"" prosecutors said.

""It is absolutely sickening that Merriam-Webster now tells blatant lies and promotes anti-science propaganda,"" Hanson wrote, according to prosecutors. ""There is no such thing as ‘gender identity.’ The imbecile who wrote this entry should be hunted down and shot.""

Twice he threatened to shoot and bomb company headquarters, prompting Merriam-Webster to close offices in Springfield and New York City for several days, prosecutors said.

Hanson also wrote an email to the president of the University of North Texas in 2022 that said ""You ought to be shot in the head and have your offices set on fire,"" for supporting transgender students, prosecutors said.

Florida nurse pleads guilty to replacing fentanyl with saline,"A nurse who previously worked at a Florida outpatient surgical center has been convicted of stealing fentanyl and replacing the powerful pain medication with saline.

Catherine Shannon Dunton, 54, pleaded guilty Tuesday to tampering with a consumer product in Fort Pierce federal court, according to court records. She faces up to 10 years in prison at a June 27 hearing.

According to court records, Dunton worked from September 2021 to April 2022 as a circulating nurse at The Surgery Center at Jensen Beach, about 45 miles north of West Palm Beach.

Center employees performing an inventory noticed the missing drugs, and video surveillance was used to identify Dunton as a suspect, officials said.

Beginning in February last year, prosecutors said Dunton took vials of fentanyl and injected it into herself. To avoid detection, she replaced the narcotic painkiller from nearly 450 vials with saline solution, and then returned the adulterated vials to the center for use during outpatient surgical procedures, investigators said.

Prosecutors had arranged for a Food and Drug Administration anesthesiologist to testify that surgery patients receiving diluted fentanyl was not safe. Inadequate pain control can also lead to an elevated risk of heart attack or stroke in vulnerable patients, officials said. Also, tampering with the vial presented a risk of contamination, which could lead to infection during or after the surgical procedure.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
India grapples with shrinking female workforce as population soars,"Sheela Singh cried the day she handed in her resignation.

For 16 years, she had been a social worker in Mumbai, India's frenetic financial capital, and she loved the work. But her family kept telling her she needed to stay at home to take care of her two children. She resisted the pressure for years, but when she found out her daughter was skipping school when she was at work, it felt like she didn't have a choice.

""Everyone used to tell me my kids were neglected … it made me feel really bad,"" Singh, 39, said.

INDIAN MAN RIGGED MUSIC SYSTEM WITH EXPLOSIVES THAT KILLED GROOM OF FORMER LOVER: REPORTS

When she resigned in 2020, Singh was earning more money than her husband, an auto-rickshaw driver whose earnings fluctuated day to day. But nobody suggested he quit.

""His friends used to taunt him that he was living off my salary,"" Singh said. ""I thought that clearly there was no value in me working so what’s the use?""

India is on the cusp of surpassing China to become the world’s most populous country, and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world. But the number of Indian women in the workforce, already among the 20 lowest in the world, has been shrinking for years.

It’s not only a problem for women like Singh, but a growing challenge for India’s own economic ambitions if its estimated 670 million women are left behind as its population expands. The hope is that India's fast-growing working-age population will propel its growth for years to come. Yet experts worry this could just as easily become a demographic liability if India fails to ensure its rising population, especially its women, are employed.

Without Singh’s income, her family can no longer afford to live in Mumbai, one of Asia’s most expensive cities, and she’s now preparing to move back to her village to save money. ""But there are no jobs there,"" she sighed.

EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is part of an ongoing series exploring what it means for the 1.4 billion inhabitants of India to live in what will be the world’s most populated country. ___

The women’s employment rate peaked at 35% in 2004 and fell to around 25% in 2022, according to calculations based off official data, said Rosa Abraham, an economist at Azim Premji University. But official figures count as employed people who report as little as one hour of work outside the home in the previous week.

A national jobs crisis is one reason for the gap, experts say, but entrenched cultural beliefs that see women as the primary caregivers and stigmatize them working outside the home, as in Singh's case, is another.

The Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE), which uses a more restrictive definition of employment, found that only 10% of working age Indian women in 2022 were either employed or looking for jobs. This means there are only 39 million women employed in the workforce compared to 361 million men.

Just a few decades ago, things seemed to be on a different track.

When Singh became a social worker in 2004, India was still riding high from historic reforms in the 1990s. New industries and new opportunities were born seemingly overnight, sparking millions to leave their villages and move to cities like Mumbai in search of better jobs.

It felt life-changing. ""I didn’t have a college degree, so I never thought it would be possible for someone like me to get a job in an office,"" she said.

Even then, leaving home to work was an uphill fight for many women. Sunita Sutar, who was in school in 2004, said that women in her village of Shirsawadi in Maharashtra state were usually married off at 18, beginning lives that revolved around their husbands’ homes. Neighbors mocked her parents for investing in her education, saying it wouldn’t matter after marriage.

WELL COLLAPSE AT INDIAN TEMPLE KILLS AT LEAST 8

Sutar bucked the trend. In 2013, she became the first person in her village of nearly 2,000 people to earn an engineering degree.

""I knew that if I studied, only then would I become something -- otherwise, I’d be like the rest, married off and stuck in the village,"" Sutar said.

Today, she lives and works in Mumbai as an auditor for the Indian Defense Department, a government job coveted by many Indians for its security, prestige and benefits.

In one way, she was part of a trend: Indian women have gained better access to education since her youth, and are now nearly at parity with men. But for most women, education hasn’t led to jobs. Even as more women have begun graduating from school, joblessness has swelled.

""The working age population continues to grow but employment hasn’t kept up, which means the proportion of people with jobs will only decline,"" said Mahesh Vyas, director at CMIE, adding there’s been a severe slowdown in good quality jobs in the last decade. ""This also keeps women out of the workforce as they or their families may see more benefit in taking care of the home or children, instead of toiling in low-paid work.""

And even when jobs are available, social pressures can keep women away.

In her home village in Uttar Pradesh state, Chauhan hardly ever saw women working outside the home. But when she came to Mumbai in 2006, she saw women swarm public spaces, Chauhan said, serving food in cafes, cutting hair or painting nails in salons, selling tickets for the local trains, or boarding the trains themselves, crammed into packed compartments as they rushed to work. It was motivating to see what was possible, she said.

""When I started working and leaving the house, my family used to say I must be working as a prostitute,"" said Lalmani Chauhan, a social worker.

One reason she was able to hold onto her job was because it became a lifeline when an accident left her husband bedridden and unable to work, Chauhan said.

Abraham said there is growing recognition among policymakers that the retreat of women from the workforce is a huge problem, but it has not been met with direct fixes like more childcare facilities or transportation safety.

When more women participate in the labor market, she added, they contribute to the economy and their family’s income, but they also are empowered to make decisions. Children who grow up in a household where both parents work, especially girls, are more likely to be employed later.

The number of working-age Indian women who don’t have jobs is staggering — almost twice the entire number of people in the United States. Experts say this gap could be a huge opportunity if India can find a way to plug it. A 2018 McKinsey report estimated that India could add $552 billion to its GDP by increasing its female workforce participation rate by 10 percent.

Even as she prepares to leave her one-bedroom home, tucked deep inside a narrow lane in a Mumbai slum, Singh is determined to return to the city in the near future. She hopes to find a way to work again, saying she will take whatever job she can find.

""I never had to ask anyone for a single rupee (before),"" Singh said, adding she feels shame every time she’s forced to ask her husband.

""I felt independent before. See, I lost a part of myself when I quit my job,"" she said. ""I want that feeling back.""",2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z
Pakistanis living overseas sent $2.5 billion back home in March as country grapples with economic crisis,"Pakistanis living abroad have sent $2.5 billion home in March, responding to the cash-strapped government's appeal for more hard currency remittances, the country's central bank said Monday.

The sum represents a 27.4% increase compared to February and is the highest in seven past months, according to a tweet by the State Bank of Pakistan. The announcement offered some hope for improving Pakistan's ailing economy, officials said. The remittances came mainly from Pakistanis living in the United States, Britain and the Middle East.

Pakistan is grappling with one of its worst economic crises, exacerbated by last summer’s devastating floods that killed 1,739 people, destroyed 2 million homes and caused $30 billion in damages.

ECONOMY IS IN THE TANK, BANKS ARE REELING, INFLATION IS SKY-HIGH AND THERE'S MORE BIDEN ISN'T TELLING YOU

The impoverished country also has been hit by a wave of violence, which last week prompted top political and military leaders to order new operations against the Pakistani Taliban, a militant group that is separate but allied with the Afghan Taliban. The Pakistani Taliban have stepped up attacks on security forces since unilaterally ending a cease-fire with the government last November.

In an overnight attack, the militant group shot and killed two police officers in Quetta, the capital of southwestern Baluchistan province, police said Monday. One of the assailants was also killed when police returned fire. The provincial chief minister, Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, condemned the attack. In a statement, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting.

Pakistan is in the final phase of talks with the International Monetary Fund to secure a crucial instalment of $1.1 billion loan from a $6 billion bailout package. The tranche has been on hold since December over Pakistan’s failure to meet the terms of a previous deal, signed in 2019 by then-Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Economists fear a failure to get the IMF loan would spark a surge in inflation. About 21% of Pakistan’s 220 million people live in poverty.

ECONOMY IS IN THE TANK, BANKS ARE REELING, INFLATION IS SKY-HIGH AND THERE'S MORE BIDEN ISN'T TELLING YOU

Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has blamed Khan, now opposition leader, for much of the economic demise, saying the former cricket star turned Islamist politician violated the terms of the 2019 agreement with the IMF.

Sharif has also asked his finance minister, Ishaq Dar, to sit out a trip to Washington on Monday for the annual meeting of the Word Bank and the IMF because of the country's dire economic crisis. Dar will instead join the gathering virtually.

Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament in April 2022 and has campaigned demanding Sharif schedule early elections. In a speech to lawmakers Monday, Dar accused Khan of intentionally deepening the crisis to harm the country.

""We will put Pakistan back on the path of progress,"" Dar said in Parliament, claiming that Pakistan managed to avoid default ""by the grace of God"" and ""because of the timely measures"" taken by Sharif's administration.

"Europe's JUICE mission will explore Jupiter system, planet's ocean-bearing moons","The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft lifts off on Thursday, entering a new phase in the search for extraterrestrial life.

The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer launches aboard the Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana.

JUICE will make detailed observations of the giant gas planet and its three ocean-bearing moons, including Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.

It is fitted with a suite of remote sensing, geophysical and in situ instruments, including one led by NASA.

The mission will characterize the moons as planetary objects and as possible habitats for past or present life, exploring Jupiter's magnetic, radiation and plasma environment in detail, and studying the wider system as an archetype for gas giants across the universe.

In the two-plus weeks after the launch, JUICE will deploy its antennas and instrument booms, followed by an intense three-month commissioning of its scientific instruments.

The first of four gravity-assisted flybys in the inner solar system will take place in August 2024.

"Volcano in Russia erupts, sends ash cloud over hundreds of miles","The eruption of Shiveluch, one of the area's most active volcanoes, sent clouds of dust more than 65,000 feet into the sky, engulfing villages in gray dust.

The ash cloud extended over more than 300 miles and the event triggered an aviation warning.

Officials closed the skies over the area to aircraft and local authorities advised residents to stay indoors, with schools shuttered and power supplies cut for two villages for a few hours.

Drinking water was reportedly being supplied, according to the head of the Ust-Kamchatsky municipal region, Oleg Bondarenko.

There were no immediate reports of casualties, although scientists said the volcano was still erupting 15 hours after its start.

The eruption occurred just after midnight, and reached its peak just about six hours later, according to the Kamchatka Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences Geophysical Survey.

The ash fell on more than 41,000 square miles of territory, according to the organization.

US DESIGNATES WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER EVAN GERSHKOVICH AS 'WRONGFULLY DETAINED' BY RUSSIA

The village of Klyuchi sits around 30 miles from the volcano and was covered by a 3-inch layer of dust.

Scientists reportedly described the fallout as the biggest in nearly 60 years.

Lava flows – which were not anticipated to reach local villages – melted snow and prompted a warning of mud flows along a nearby highway.

Around 300,000 residents live on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, which lies about 4,000 miles east of Moscow.

NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spots runaway black hole creating ‘trail of stars’,"NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope has accidentally captured images of a ""runaway"" black hole barreling through space, leaving behind a contrail of newborn stars.

The black hole, weighing as much as 20 million suns, is traveling through space so fast that if it were in our solar system, it could travel from Earth to the Moon in 14 minutes, according to NASA.

The 200,000-light-year ""contrail"" of stars that the black hole is leaving behind is approximately twice the diameter of the Milky Way. NASA said the phenomenon is likely the result of a game of ""galactic billiards among three massive black holes.

The new stars are forming as the black hole is plowing into the gas in front of it to trigger new formations along a narrow corridor. NASA said the sighting is unprecedented.

""What we’re seeing is the aftermath. Like the wake of a ship we’re seeing the wake behind the black hole,"" Pieter van Dokkum of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, said in a statement. ""The trail must have lots of new stars, given that it is almost half as bright as the host galaxy it is linked to.""

TOWNS UNDER 2024 SOLAR ECLIPSE'S PATH OF TOTALITY BEGIN PREPARING FOR RARE EVENT

Van Dokkum said it was ""pure serendipity"" that researchers stumbled across the finding. According to NASA, van Dokkum was looking for globular star clusters in a nearby dwarf galaxy.

""I was just scanning through the Hubble image and then I noticed that we have a little streak. I immediately thought, 'oh, a cosmic ray hitting the camera detector and causing a linear imaging artifact,’"" van Dokkum said. ""When we eliminated cosmic rays we realized it was still there. It didn't look like anything we've seen before.""

Van Dokkum investigated further and concluded that they were looking at the aftermath of a black hole flying through a halo of gas surrounding the host galaxy.

NASA believes the ""intergalactic skyrocket"" is likely the culmination of multiple collisions of supermassive black holes – with the first two galaxies merging around 50 million years ago.

China opts out of UN wildlife survey aimed at preventing future pandemics caused by animals,"China is not participating in a United Nations project to survey Asian wet markets and other facilities at high risk of spreading infectious diseases from wild animals to humans, despite long-running talks with Beijing, a UN official told Reuters.

China's hesitancy to join the UN project involving other Asian nations may compound frustration by global researchers who have been pressing Beijing to share information about the origins of COVID-19, as they seek to prevent future pandemics due to zoonotic, or animal-to-human, disease transmission.

Four Asian countries - China, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos - were initially selected for the survey by the scientific advisory committee of the project, called the Safety across Asia For the global Environment (SAFE), because they host multiple facilities presenting risks of animal-to-human disease transmission, the UN official said.

FBI DIRECTOR SAYS COVID PANDEMIC 'MOST LIKELY' ORIGINATED FROM CHINESE LAB

The selection for the project, launched in July 2021, was also made after major wildlife trafficking cases were detected, investigated and prosecuted in those countries, which increased zoonotic risks, the official said.

""China was initially in discussions to be part of the project,"" the official said, declining to be named as the information was deemed sensitive.

The official said discussions with China are still ongoing, but did not clarify with which state institution the UN project is holding talks.

China's foreign ministry and the country's National Forestry and Grasslands Administration (NFGA), which oversees the management of wildlife and was involved in initial talks with the project organizers, did not respond to requests for comment.

The official said NFGA initially showed interest in the project but eventually declined to join, saying it was not under its remit. The agency did not indicate which government agencies would be responsible for the matter, the official said.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which monitors illegal wildlife trafficking and coordinates the SAFE project, had no immediate comment.

After a strain of coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, many researchers suspected it spread in a live animal market there.

China has since banned the sale and consumption for food of wildlife animals. Despite the ban, experts warn risks still remain.

""There are glaring holes in the restrictions that still pose a zoonotic disease risk,"" said Peter Li, China Policy Specialist for Humane Society International, a Washington-based non-profit organization.

He said China still allows wildlife breeding on a massive scale for fur trade, traditional medicine, pet trade and for entertainment or display in low welfare conditions.

China's public security organs have handled more than 70,000 criminal cases involving wild animals from 2020-2022, confiscating 1.37 million wild animals in the process, state news agency Xinhua has reported.

The country's revised wildlife law, designed to close regulatory loopholes, is due to take effect in May, according to the National People's Congress website.

The SAFE project surveys only began in October last year, when the project's assessors visited Khao Kheow zoo and a cafe in Thailand. Another dozen surveys have been conducted in the country since then.

The goal is to boost pandemic prevention and preparedness, the official said, noting the results of the surveys would be solely shared with the participating governments.

After China effectively dropped out from initial talks, it was replaced with the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island, according to the list of participating countries posted on the official website of the project.

About 40 facilities in each participating country are to be surveyed to identify potential risks of disease transmission.

The facilities to be surveyed include restaurants, wet markets, biomedical supply facilities, zoos and breeding facilities. The wet markets targeted are markets where wild animals are sold alongside fresh meat and vegetables.

Vietnam and Laos have yet to approve the surveys. The UN official expected the formal greenlight from the two countries over the coming weeks or months. Malaysia's Sabah has authorized the field visits.

A second UN official, from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which implements the project, said practices that can increase disease transmission risks include lack of hygiene, mixing of different animal species and the use of overcrowded cages.

The project, which is funded by the European Union and will run until July 2024, could be expanded to involve the World Health Organization (WHO) if public health considerations are identified, the first UN official said.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"As India inches closer as world’s most populous nation, interest in birth control continues to decline","Pratima Kumari, a government health worker in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, sets off on her mini scooter every morning, crisscrossing vast corn fields and pineapple orchards to visit villages and meet young, married couples.

She offers condoms and birth control pills for free in the Kishanganj district and talks to the couples about birth control and the benefits of having just two children.

But it's mostly been a losing battle in Kishanganj, which has the highest fertility rate of any district in India, soon to be the world's most populous nation.

""The minute I tell couples to use condoms or suggest permanent birth control, they ignore it or just change the topic,"" Kumari told Reuters.

Kishanganj, and Bihar, are exceptions in India, which has over decades controlled its population growth.

The national fertility rate, or the number of children a woman has on average, fell to 2.0 in 2019-21, just below the replacement rate of 2.1, official data shows.

But Bihar, one of India's least developed states, had the highest fertility rate of 2.98. State health officials estimate Kishanganj's fertility rate at 4.8 or 4.9.

Successive state governments have been aware of the population growth problem, particularly in Kishanganj, and have mounted programs to curb it.

Besides the free distribution of condoms and birth control pills, the state pays $36.50 to women who get sterilized and $48.80 to men. Health workers who get people sterilized are paid $6.10 per surgery.

Yet the results have been poor.

""I talk to women while they are experiencing labor pain and nudge them to undergo sterilization immediately after delivery,"" said Parvati Rajak, a medical officer in one of Kishanganj’s seven government health centers.

""But the final choice is always made by the family,"" she said, minutes after helping a woman deliver her fifth child.

Jahan Sheikh, a mother of four and pregnant for the fifth time, said she was not in favor of sterilization .

Sheikh said her mother-in-law told her it was good to have at least five children as they would help in the farm and at home.

""I don’t know but getting a sterilization operation makes me nervous. What if there are problems after the surgery? Who will take care of my kids,"" she asked.

A 2021 Bihar planning and development department report said the state had a sterilization target of 871,307 people in 2020 but managed just 401,693 or 46%..

INDIA SET TO OVERTAKE CHINA AS WORLD'S MOST POPULOUS COUNTRY IN NEXT 3 MONTHS: UN REPORT

Men refused to undergo sterilization as they thought the procedure would harm their masculinity, health workers say.

In Kishanganj, only 0.2% of the male population was sterilized while it was 22.8% for the female population, the state government report said.

Just minutes after giving birth to her fifth child at a government clinic in Kishanganj, Zamerun, the wife of a mason, said she would try to secure permission from her husband to undergo sterilization before leaving for home.

""My body cannot take this pressure of having babies anymore,"" she told Reuters. ""I have been lucky to survive each time.""

Her husband later said he had agreed, and Zamerun was sterilized .

Reuters spoke with 14 women and six government medical officers for this report and eight of the 14 women said their families expected them to have at least five children.

""For the fourth time I have had a girl...now I will wait for a few years before I try to have a boy,"" said Chandani Devi, 36, as she tried to fight back tears in a hospital ward after her delivery.

Her newborn girl was lying next to her and nurses were helping her feed the weak baby.

Senior government officials said they faced an uphill task.

""We are doing our best but in a democracy one can only do this much...we cannot dictate rules on family planning,"" said Tejashwi Yadav, Bihar's deputy chief minister who holds the health portfolio and has eight siblings.

Sanjay Kumar Pansari, director in the Bihar government's Directorate of Economics and Statistics, said the state’s fertility rate is slowly showing signs of decline.

""The state government's focus is to ensure that policy interventions percolate to the ground, its mechanisms such as free sterilization , temporary birth control instruments are used actively,"" Pansari told Reuters.

The moon – also known as the sprouting grass, egg, fish, pesach, paschal or passover moon – would appear full through Friday morning.

The pink moon is named after the herb moss pink, according to Maine Farmers' Almanac. The herb is also known as creeping phlox, moss phlox or mountain phlox and is native to the eastern U. S. It is one of the earliest widespread flowers of spring.

Among the coastal tribes, it was known as the fish moon, when the shad swam upstream to spawn.

As the lunar cycle progresses, the moon will still appear near Spica on Friday, the star Antares on April 10 and the planet Saturn on April 16.

Located 11,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia, Cassiopeia A is the youngest known remnant from an exploding, massive star in our galaxy. It spans about 10 light-years.

While Cassiopeia A is a prototypical supernova remnant that has been widely studied, Webb's infrared capability allows researchers to see in new detail.

"'Horrible' bill banning police dogs from being used in arrests would 'embolden' criminals, sheriff says","A California sheriff criticized lawmakers who want to keep police dogs from biting suspected criminals or being used during protests, calling K-9s an important ""less-lethal"" option for law enforcement.

""One of our one of our biggest successes and biggest tools to deescalate situations is the deployment of canines,"" Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told Fox News.

SOROS-BACKED CALIFORNIA DA FLOATED KEEPING GANG MEMBERS ACCUSED OF KILLING TODDLER OUT OF JAIL: REPORT

AB 742 would prohibit police from using dogs to apprehend a suspect or for crowd control. Police dogs would not be allowed to bite people under any circumstances, according to the bill text. The bill does not prevent the use of search and rescue dogs or police K-9s that sniff out bombs or drugs.

""The use of police canines has been a mainstay in this country’s dehumanizing, cruel, and violent abuse of Black Americans and people of color for centuries,"" the bill reads, adding that police dogs were used by slave catchers and, more recently, to quell civil unrest like the Los Angeles race riots and Black Lives Matter protests.

Statistics from the California Department of Justice show no use-of-force injuries involving police dogs during civil disorder or assemblies in 2020 or 2021.

""Every agency should have canines,"" Bianco said, adding that very few deployments of canines result in bites and ""those deployments are all toward violent people.""

There are few national statistics on K-9 use or injuries associated with police dogs, but one study showed police dog bites sent nearly 33,000 people to U. S. hospitals between 2005 and 2013.

In California, police dogs accounted for nearly 14% of the use-of-force incidents that resulted in injury in 2021, according to the state's DOJ. K-9 use is also largely unregulated in California — individual police departments can set their own policies, and training guidelines published almost a decade ago are optional.

James Webb Space Telescope captures most detailed ever image of Uranus,"NASA released a stunning image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope of the planet Uranus, showing the ice giant’s bright features in the planet’s atmosphere and 11 of the 13 known rings.

A zoomed-in image of the planet was captured in a 12-minute exposure using two filters on Feb. 6, 2023.

Although this is not the first image of the seventh planet from the sun, it is the most detailed ever captured.

Launched into orbit in December 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope is an international venture between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

The telescope uses its Near Infrared Camera, or NIRCam, to pull back the curtain on some of the telescope’s most popular finds and can see in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which humans are not capable of doing.

Prior to the James Webb Space Telescope images, Uranus has only been captured by two other facilities. In 1986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the planet, and the Keck Observatory has captured images using advanced adaptive optics.

What makes Uranus unique is that it rotates on its side, or as NASA said, roughly 90-degress from its plane of orbit.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE ‘NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED’

As a result, the planet has extreme seasons due to many years of constant sunlight followed by many years of darkness. The planet also takes 84 Earth years to orbit the Sun.

The image captured shows the northern pole, where it is late spring on the planet. When Voyager 2 visited Uranus in 1986, it was summer at the south pole, which is now on the opposite side of the planet.

According to NASA, the infrared image from Webb’s NIRCam uses data from two filters, shown in blue and orange, and the planet displays a blue hue.

Voyager 2’s image of Uranus depicted the planet as a ""featureless blue-green ball,"" NASA said, and Webb’s image shows the dynamic nature of the planet.

GREEN COMET WILL PASS BY EARTH FOR FIRST TIME SINCE NEANDERTHALS ROAMED EARTH

""On the right side of the planet there’s an area of brightening at the pole facing the Sun, known as a polar cap,"" NASA said in the release, adding that the cap appears when the pole enters direct sunlight in the summer and disappears in the fall.

At the edge of the polar cap is a bright cloud, along with one on the far-left side of the planet. These clouds, NASA said, are connected to storm activity.

The planet has 13 known rings, and Webb captured 11 of those rings, though some are so bright that they blend into a larger ring.

Pentagon document leak has immediate impact on national security,"The leaked Pentagon documents will have a compounding effect of distracting officials from other, urgent topics of national security and will weaken allies’ trust in the country's ability to safeguard intelligence and operatives, experts told Fox News Digital.

""For the diplomats, this is going to take up a lot of oxygen that would otherwise be devoted to high priorities in our bilateral relations with many of the countries that are mentioned in these documents like South Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Israel,"" former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital. ""We're going to be talking about this stuff.""

FBI agents arrested Massachusetts Air National Guardsmen Jack Douglas Teixeira at a home in North Dighton, Massachusetts, on Thursday in relation to a trove of classified documents that have been leaked online in recent months.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Teixeira, 21, is being investigated for the ""alleged unauthorized removal, retention, and transmission of classified national defense information.""

James Anderson, former Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, said that he fully expected ""many, many decades in a federal prison"" following a conviction, but that in the immediate aftermath, the U. S. needs to ensure that it restores ally confidence.

""It's important in the aftermath of this that there be a very thorough internal investigation as to what happened, and a congressional inquiry,"" Anderson said. ""That's what will be necessary to help convince allies and partners that we're doing everything in our power to try to prevent similar episodes from recurring in the future.""

""If we fail to convince them of our seriousness on this point, then they will be less likely to want to share sensitive intelligence with the United States government, and that would be most unfortunate,"" he added.

Hoffman highlighted the damage the leaks have caused to the CIA and intelligence assets out in the field, some of whom will have lost confidence in the U. S.' ability to protect their most sensitive information.

""Our sources, existing ones and those whom we hope to recruit, are going to wonder whether we can protect their information and their identities,"" he argued. ""Our people out in the field — my former colleagues at the CIA, even — have to reassure existing sources and potential sources that we can do that in spite of these leaks, and that's a that's not easy to do.""

""People are going to be taken off-line to deal with this counterintelligence flap, and the opportunity cost of that is they're not going to do other stuff they've got to deal with that is high priority, and that's not good for our national security, either,"" he added.

Hubble astronomers find double quasar in distant merging galaxies,"Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope and other observatories have discovered a pair of gravitationally-bound quasars inside two merging galaxies.

Quasars are active and luminous types of active galactic nuclei, and the European Space Agency explains that active galactic nuclei are extremely luminous galactic cores where gas and dust falling into a supermassive black hole emit electromagnetic radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

In a release, NASA explained that the bright quasars – powered by the black holes expelling fountains of energy – existed when the universe was just 3 billion years old.

""We don't see a lot of double quasars at this early time in the universe. And that's why this discovery is so exciting,"" lead study author and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student Yu-Ching Chen, said in a statement.

WEBB ASTRONOMERS DISCOVER EARLIEST GALAXIES CONFIRMED SO FAR IN NEW MILESTONE

The research was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.

The agency noted that there is increasing evidence that large galaxies are built up through merging smaller systems, with pairs of supermassive black holes within the galaxies.

New observatories have allowed scientists to identify times when two quasars are active at the same time and are close enough that they will eventually merge.

The search presented here required the combined efforts of the Hubble Telescope, Hawaii's W. M. Keck Observatories and the International Gemini Observatory, New Mexico's NSF Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE 'NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED'

The ESA Gaia space observatory also helped to identify this double quasar in the first place.

Hublle's sharp resolution shows that this is a genuine pair of supermassive black holes including a tidal feature from the merging of two galaxies, where gravity distorts the shape of the galaxies forming two tails of stars. In addition, Gaia is able to detect subtle ""jiggle"" that mimics an apparent change in stellar position from some the quasars it observes.

The jiggle could be evidence of random fluctuations of light, according to the agency, as each member of the quasar pair varies in brightness and flashes like a railroad crossing signal – creating the illusion of jiggling.

The researchers also used the Keck telescope to make sure there is no lensing galaxy between Earth and the suspected double quasar, which no longer exists.

""Because Hubble peers into the distant past, this double quasar no longer exists.

Pennsylvania woman allegedly strangled 11-year-old son to death over 'financial difficulties',"The Pennsylvania woman accused of killing her 11-year-old son allegedly told detectives that she strangled her child to death because of the family's financial situation, an affidavit reveals.

The Horsham Township Police Department responded to a residence on Tuesday after the boy's father called 911 and said that the 11-year-old was unresponsive, adding that he believed his wife, Ruth Dirienzo-Whitehead, 50, killed him.

During an interview with police, the husband said that he slept in another room on Monday night and when he woke up, he noticed that the master bedroom door, where his wife and son slept, was locked. Additionally, he told officers that his wife's black Toyota Highlander was missing from their garage. The father told detectives that it wasn't unusual for him to sleep in a different room than with his wife.

The father forced entry into the bedroom and found his 11-year-old son dead.

The detective said that these are all ""consistent with strangulation,"" according to an affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital.

Another detective observed that the child had ""blood and fluids draining from his mouth and nose.""

While law enforcement was still on the scene in Horsham, Pennsylvania, the police department received a call from the Cape May, New Jersey Prosecutors Office, explaining that police had found Dirienzo-Whitehead's car submerged in the ocean just off of Beach Avenue on Tuesday.

Dirienzo-Whitehead wasn't located with the Toyota Highlander, but was taken into custody in Wildwood Crest, New Jersey, shortly after.

In an interview with detectives, Dirienzo-Whitehead said that she and her 11-year-old son went to bed in the master bedroom at 9:30 p.m. on Monday. She said that her son had been ""upset and crying off and on all day over the family's financial difficulties,"" according to the probable cause affidavit.

The mother told officials during the interview that she strangled her son to death while he was sleeping.

Dirienzo-Whitehead said in the interview with detectives that she ""did not want Matthew to grow up with these struggles"" which is why she ""strangled him with her husband's belt as he slept,"" the affidavit said, paraphrasing the mother.

After allegedly killing her son, Dirienzo-Whitehead ""drove her vehicle onto The Cove Beach and into the ocean,"" the affidavit states.

When the car was no longer operable, Dirienzo-Whitehead walked to Wildwood Crest and was found by the Wildwood Crest Police Department, officials said.

Webb astronomers discover earliest galaxies confirmed so far in new milestone,"Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, an international team of astronomers has discovered the earliest galaxies confirmed to date.

The light from the galaxies, per a European Space Agency release, said light from the galaxies has taken more than 13.4 billion years to reach Earth.

The galaxies date back to less than 400 million years after the big bang — a time when the universe was just 2% of its current age.

The release notes that earlier data from the observatory had provided candidates for such infant galaxies. The post highlights data from Webb science in progress, which has not yet been through the peer-review process.

WHO ARE THE ARTEMIS II ASTRONAUTS?

Now, the agency said, the targets have been confirmed by spectroscopic observations. Those observations had revealed ""characteristic and distinctive patterns in the fingerprints of light"" emitted by the faint galaxies.

The findings resulted from the collaboration of scientists who led the development of Webb's NIRCam(Near-Infrared Camera) and NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instruments. The motivation for these instruments was the investigation of the faintest and earliest galaxies and, in 2015, the instrument teams joined forces to propose the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES).

JADES, which has been allocated just over one month of the telescope’s time over a period two years, is designed to provide an unprecedented view of the early universe. The first round of its observations honed in on the area around the Hubble Space Telescope's Ultra Deep Field.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE 'NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED'

""These results are the culmination of why the NIRCam and NIRSpec teams joined together to execute this observing program,"" co-author Marcia Rieke, NIRCam principal investigator from the University of Arizona, said in a statement.

The JADES program used NIRCam to observe the field over 10 days of mission time and in nine different infrared colors. They searched for faint galaxies that are visible in the infrared but whose light abruptly cuts off at a critical wavelength. The location of the cutoff within each galaxy’s spectrum is shifted due to the universe’s expansion. Next, they used the NIRSPec instrument for three days and collected the light from 250 faint galaxies, allowing for a precise measure of each galaxy's redshift and the properties of the gas and stars in them.

The redshift is stretching of early universe light due to the expansion of the universe. It can be used as a measure of distance, with early galaxies displaying extreme redshifts.

Four of the galaxies were revealed to be at an unprecedentedly early epoch, lying at redshifts above 10 — including two at 13.

That corresponds to a time when the universe was approximately 330 million years old. The researcher first reported the results in December of last year and two research papers were published Tuesday in the journal Nature.

JADES will continue to study another field in 2023 before returning to the Ultra Deep Field for another round of deep imaging and spectroscopy.",2023-04-05T00:00:00.000Z
'Friday Night Lights' star Minka Kelly details shocking childhood,"Minka Kelly is revealing details of her ""chaotic"" and ""unstable"" childhood — raised by an exotic dancer — in a shocking, upcoming memoir.

The actress, now 42, shares stories of her mother, ""Mo,"" taking her to strip clubs as a child, physical abuse and getting pregnant at 17. The memoir, ""Tell Me Everything,"" is set to be published May 2.

""My childhood was colorful and chaotic, unstable and inconsistent, unpredictable and hard a lot of the times,"" Kelly told People magazine. ""But the silver lining is that it made me a very adaptable person.""

The actress grew up in poverty and often unsupervised as her mother worked as an exotic dancer to make ends meet. Mo would sometimes take the young child with her to the Crazy Girls strip club in Los Angeles, and they'd go grocery shopping at 2 a.m. afterward if Mo made enough money, according to People.

‘EUPHORIA’ STAR MINKA KELLY, LIKE SYDNEY SWEENEY, PUSHED BACK AGAINST NUDE SCENES: ‘WE CAN KEEP MY DRESS ON’

At the age of 17, Kelly performed in peep shows at an adult video store in New Mexico — to make ends meet while her mother wasn't around, the outlet reported.

""I started with the scariest part,"" Kelly told People of her decision to write about the peep show in first part of the memoir. ""The part that I carried the most shame about, the part that I felt the most embarrassed of, the part that I hid my whole life, and the part that I've had people make me feel bad about. And I felt like that was just where I had to be the most brave.""

Kelly also found out she was pregnant at the age of 17 with her high-school boyfriend, Rudy. The actress moved in with Rudy at the time but later chose to have an abortion.

Kelly recalled making the decision after her mom suggested they raise the baby together.

""Raise this baby together, how?"" Kelly wrote, according to excerpts obtained by Page Six. ""With what money? What home? What insurance? I couldn’t imagine bringing a baby into what my mother brought me into. Absolutely not.""

""That was it. In that moment, I knew the right choice,"" she added. ""Raising a child with my mother would only continue this family trauma, another cycle added to so many generations of pain. Hadn’t there been enough damage already?""

The ""Just Go With It"" star detailed her toxic relationship with Rudy, explaining that he had coerced her into making a sex tape, which he later sold back to her for $50,000 after trying to sell it to the tabloids.

""I hardly even remembered making the tape,"" she wrote in the book. ""I’d become such a master at leaving my body when things were uncomfortable.""

Kelly had moved to New Mexico with her mother to live with Mo's boyfriend, David. According to Kelly, he beat her after Mo told him the actress had been ""borrowing"" the car.

""He hit me with an open hand, then a fist, over and over,"" Kelly claimed. ""He found a piece of cable wire on the floor and started thrashing me with it as I curled into a ball to protect what parts of myself I could. ... He yanked my hair, pulling me around the room by my ponytail. ... How long the beating continued, I don’t know. Welts were rising all over my skin when he finally exhausted his fury.""

Kelly recalled him asking for a hug after the beating.

""'You a--hole,' I wanted to say,"" she writes. ""'You f--king monster!' I wanted to cry and scream and tell them both to go f--k themselves, but that would only make it worse. I held it in.""

Kelly returned to Los Angeles after finishing high school and studied to become a surgical technician while acting. She was also able to reconnect with her father, a former guitarist for Aerosmith.

Kelly also wrote about her toxic relationship with ""Friday Night Lights"" co-star Taylor Kitsch in the memoir. She landed the role of Lyla Garrity on the drama, which ran from 2006 to 2009.

""All the effort I might have invested in connecting consistently with the girls on the show went to Taylor. So when my relationship with Taylor became toxic, I had no one to turn to,"" she revealed.

""Life became very difficult both on and off set whenever we broke up. We were young and had very few tools to handle our emotions and personal grievances. On the days we had to work together and were broken up, he didn’t want to be in the hair and makeup trailer at the same time I was.""

Kelly went on to have a number of high-profile relationships after her ""Friday Night Lights"" success, including John Mayer, Derek Jeter, Chris Evans and most recently Trevor Noah.

Washington state judge addresses abortion pill ruling contradicting Texas judge,"A federal judge in Washington state is clarifying his ruling on access to the abortion pill that contradicts prior rulings by two other federal courts.

In a separate suit brought by 17 states with Democrat attorneys general, Judge Thomas O. Rice issued a ruling that compels the FDA not to do anything that might affect the availability of the abortion drug mifepristone in the suing states.

Rice said his decision, maintaining full unencumbered access to the drug, remains in effect ""irrespective of the Northern District of Texas Court’s ruling or the Fifth Circuit’s anticipated ruling."" That includes access to the drug by mail.

Rice was asked to clarify his position following a federal appeals court ruling late Wednesday that the mifepristone can still be used for now but reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be taken and said it could not be dispensed by mail.

The decision temporarily narrowed a ruling by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the FDA's approval of the drug while a lawsuit over it plays out.

The Biden administration said Thursday it would appeal. The Supreme Court will be the next stop for a legal fight over a drug used in the nation's most common abortion method.

Mifepristone was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration more than two decades ago. It has been used by more than 5 million women to terminate their pregnancies and today more than half of women who end a pregnancy rely on the drug, the DOJ said.

Rice’s order marks a legal victory for abortion rights advocates, but creates further confusion over how the FDA should enforce mifepristone.

Rice’s decision will likely be cited by the Justice Department when it files its appeal with the Supreme Court seeking to reverse key parts of the earlier appeals court ruling.

NASA Curiosity Mars rover captures first ever 'sun rays' during cloud study,"NASA’s Curiosity rover captured and transmitted images of ""sun rays"" as the sun dropped below the horizon on Mars last month, which was part of a new cloud-imaging campaign that the rover is part of.

According to NASA, Martian sunsets can be ""uniquely moody,"" which is what makes these new images unique.

The ""sun rays"" were captured in an illuminated bank of clouds, and this was the first time NASA scientists had seen them so clearly on Mars.

CURIOSITY MARS ROVER FINDS THE ‘BEST EVIDENCE’ OF ANCIENT WATER IN RIPPLED ROCKS

NASA’s cloud-imaging campaign builds on 2021 observations of night-shining clouds, the space agency said, and while most clouds on Mars hover no more than 37 miles above the surface of the planet and are made of water ice, the clouds in the images sent from the rover appear to be at a higher and colder altitude.

Because the clouds are higher, scientists say they could be made of carbon dioxide ice, or dry ice.

In late January, the rover captured a feather-shaped iridescent cloud after sunset, which was also part of the cloud study.

The feather-shaped cloud image is composed of 28 images captured with the rover’s mast camera, or Mastcam. The images were processed to put emphasis on the highlights, NASA said.

Scientists hope that by studying where and when clouds form on Mars, they will get a better understanding about the composition of the planet’s atmosphere, including the temperatures and winds within it.

A cloud survey conducted in 2021 included images from the black-and-white navigation cameras and provided a look at the structure of clouds as they moved.

The difference with this study is the Mastcam is providing color images, which show how the cloud particles grow over time, according to NASA.

""Where we see iridescence, it means a cloud’s particle sizes are identical to their neighbors in each part of the cloud,"" Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado said in a press release from NASA. ""By looking at color transitions, we’re seeing particle size changing across the cloud. That tells us about the way the cloud is evolving and how its particles are changing size over time.""

The Curiosity rover was launched on Nov. 26, 2011 and landed on Mars on Aug. 5, 2012. Its mission was to find out whether Mars ever had the right environmental conditions to support life, and early on, the rover discovered chemical and mineral evidence habitable environments from the past.",2023-03-09T00:00:00.000Z
Matthew McConaughey explains why he decided not to run for Texas governor,"Matthew McConaughey said this week that although he had ""considered getting in that run"" for governor of Texas last year, he decided not to partially because he wanted to focus on being a father.

""I don’t think that’s where I can be the most useful right now,"" the ""Greenlights"" author told Chelsea Handler on her iHeartMedia ""Dear Chelsea"" podcast Thursday.

He continued, ""I’m having too good of a time. I’ve got three kids — 14, 13, 10 — and the adventures we’re going on, I’m not going to get them again; and right now, I’m enjoying being a dad, a family man. Everyone says it, but it’s true. I got seven more years, and then they’re out on their own, hopefully; and then everyone says, 'Get what you can while they’re in the house because it doesn’t come back.'""

The ""Dallas Buyers Club"" actor, who calls himself ""aggressively centrist,"" publicly toyed with the idea of running to lead his native state for a while before the election last year, and polls showed he could go toe-to-toe with Gov. Greg Abbott.

MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY SAYS RETURN TO ACTING SOUNDS LIKE ‘VACATION’ AFTER ‘YELLOWSTONE’ SPINOFF CONFIRMED

In November 2021, two weeks after the filing deadline, the 53-year-old posted a video in which he said he would sit out the election.

""Over the past two years, I've been working on the answer to the question of how I can be most useful in this life going forward,"" McConaughey said at the time. ""Useful to myself, useful to my family and to the most amount of people.""

He added, ""As a simple kid born in the little town of Uvalde, Texas, it never occurred to me that I would one day be considered for political leadership. It's a humbling and inspiring path to ponder. It is also a path that I am choosing not to take at this moment.""

In the video, McConaughey said he would ""continue to work and invest the bounty I have by supporting entrepreneurs, businesses and foundations that I believe are leaders.""

He added that ""good"" politicians can ""help us get where we need to go, but let’s be clear, they can’t do anything for us unless we choose to do for ourselves.""

McConaughey never said if he planned to run as a Republican, Democrat or an independent, but he did work with the White House last year, advocating for ""responsible"" gun regulations after the mass shooting at an elementary school in his hometown of Uvalde.

The ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" actor addressed the two-party system last year, saying he doesn’t think it’s the way forward.

""What's the role of politics in the world?"" McConaughey said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""Is it still serving democracy, which I think it should in America. Studying into two parties, seeing a loss of values, actually, because seeing people on both sides of the aisle, either side of the aisle, rather, holding on so tightly to their blue or red flag pole that their whole identities almost sometimes seems to be based on the invalidation of the other instead of the validation of their own vision.""

Abbott, who ran against Democrat Beto O’Rourke in the general election, was re-elected last year.

Curiosity Mars rover finds the 'best evidence' of ancient water in rippled rocks,"NASA's Curiosity rover has recently discovered rippled rock textures that suggest lakes existed in a region of ancient Mars that scientists had expected to be drier.

Rock layers at the ""sulfate-bearing unit"" formed in drier settings than regions explored earlier in the mission, and the area's sulfates are believed to have been left behind when water was drying to just a trickle.

However, when the rover arrived there last fall, the team was surprised to find the ""clearest evidence yet of ancient water ripples that formed within lakes.""

""This is the best evidence of water and waves that we’ve seen in the entire mission,"" Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity’s project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a statement. ""We climbed through thousands of feet of lake deposits and never saw evidence like this – and now we found it in a place we expected to be dry.""

NASA CAPTURES PHOTO OF 'BEAR'S FACE' ON THE SURFACE OF MARS

Billions of years ago, NASA said, waves on the surface of a shallow lake stirred up sediment at the bottom, creating the rippled rock textures.

Climbing nearly half a mile above the base of Mount Sharp, the rover found the textures preserved in the ""Marker Band,"" which is a thin layer of dark rock that stands out from the rest of the mountain. The rock layer is so hard that Curiosity has not been able to drill a sample from it after several attempts, and scientists will be looking for softer rock in coming weeks.

Another clue within the Marker Band is an unusual rock texture that was likely caused by some sort of regular cycle in the weather or climate.

In addition, NASA said that scientists can see another clue to the history of Mars' water in a valley named Gediz Vallis. Scientists suspect that wet landslides occurred there – resulting in debris – and a channel running through the valley that starts on Mount Sharp is thought to have been eroded by a small river.

Elon Musk warns of 'tough sledding' for US economy until next year,"Billionaire Elon Musk warned of a difficult slog for the U. S. economy over the next year after recent turmoil within the banking system reignited fears over an imminent recession.

""Tough sledding until spring next year is my best guess,"" the Tesla CEO and Twitter chief said in a tweet late Wednesday.

Musk was responding to a tweet that noted the Federal Reserve's own staff economists are bracing for a mild recession this year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March.

THESE BUSINESS TITANS ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM OVER THE US ECONOMY

""Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years,"" Fed documents released on Wednesday said.

Musk – the wealthiest man in the world – has been a vocal pessimist about the state of the economy over the past year, repeatedly warning of severe fallout from rapid interest rate hikes.

In late March, Musk urged the central bank to reverse course in its inflation fight and cut rates.

""Fed needs to drop the rate by at least 50bps on Wednesday,"" he said in a response to a tweet by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman that suggested the central bank needed to pause its rate-hike campaign.

Fed policymakers have already approved nine consecutive rate increases, lifting the federal funds rate from nearly zero to upwards of 4.75%. Officials have opened the door to a 10th increase at their next meeting in early May, despite upheaval in the banking system and signs of a slowdown in the economy.

Markets widely expect the Fed to approve another quarter-percentage point at the conclusion of their next meeting May 2-3.

A growing number of Wall Street economists anticipate the Fed's actions will tip the economy into a recession next year. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.

5 things you might not know about Academy Award-winning star,"As a comedian, musician, actor, filmmaker and father, Jamie Foxx is beyond a triple threat.

The 55-year-old actor earned top industry accolades and won an Oscar for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the 2004 film ""Ray,"" but Foxx has been performing nearly his entire life.

His daughter, Corinne Foxx, revealed Wednesday that Foxx suffered a ""medical complication"" the day before, and ""quick action and great care"" helped guide him toward recovery. His family has not disclosed Foxx's medical issue.

""Nothing further is being provided from the family at this time,"" Foxx's representatives told Fox News Digital Thursday.

JAMIE FOXX SUFFERS ‘MEDICAL COMPLICATION,’ DAUGHTER CORRINE SAYS: ‘HE IS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO RECOVERY’

Production crews in Atlanta reportedly shut down filming his latest project, ""Back in Action,"" Wednesday, but resumed on Thursday ""using a stand-in for Foxx on set,"" a source told People. A scene scheduled for Sunday has also reportedly been canceled due to ""changes in production.""

With more than 30 years of entertainment industry experience under his belt, here's a look at five things you might not know about Jamie Foxx.

He was a natural comedian and loved telling jokes from a young age.

Foxx was dared to perform at an open mic night, and he immediately fell in love with stand-up comedy.

""It was the most incredible feeling,"" he told Texas Monthly. ""It was, ‘OK, I think I know what I want to be right now.’""

He noticed that women were usually called to the stage first, so he changed his name to something more ambiguous and gender-neutral.

WILL JAMIE FOXX'S COMEDY ‘ALL-STAR WEEKEND’ SUCCUMB TO CANCEL CULTURE?' EXPERTS WEIGH IN

Born Eric Marlon Bishop, he became known as Jamie Foxx.

He picked the moniker as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx, a pioneer in the civil rights movement who found television success portraying Fred G. Sanford on ""Sanford and Son.""

On the ""Redd Foxx: We've Come to Join You"" podcast, Jamie discussed his name change as an ode to one of the greats.

""It was a tip of the hat to him that I chose that name, and the name stuck, and I have to be thankful to him for blazing the trail as a comedian and allowing me to sort of ride on his coattails,"" he said.

Jamie grew up in a religious household. He was adopted by his grandmother, Estelle Talley, when he was a baby after his biological parents rejected him.

JERRY SEINFELD RETURNS FOR ‘COMEDIANS IN CARS’ WITH NEW GUESTS JAMIE FOXX, SETH ROGEN AND MORE

Talley began taking Foxx to piano lessons when he was 5, and by the time he was 13, he was the musical director at a local Baptist church. He told Texas Monthly that he earned $75 each Sunday, saying, ""Church is big time!""

He continued to pursue piano throughout high school, which landed him a scholarship at the U. S. International University in San Diego, where he studied classical music and composition.

The keys also helped him with side hustles, and he sang in a ""terrible"" R&B band called Leather and Lace while in school.

With his career exploding with roles on ""In Living Color"" followed by his own sitcom, ""The Jamie Foxx Show,"" and then working in movies alongside Robin Williams in ""Toys"" and with Will Smith in ""Ali,"" Foxx got into the studio to show off his vocal range for his first album, ""Peep This.""

One decade later, he was featured on the 2003 Kanye West and Twista song, ""Slow Jamz,"" which reached No.1 on the Billboard 100, and then again with West on ""Gold Digger."" The hit included a Ray Charles-inspired hook of ""I Got a Woman,"" somewhat foreshadowing his future work with the acclaimed pianist.

JAMIE FOXX SAYS DIRECTOR ONCE CALLED HIM ‘HORRIBLE,’ KICKED HIM ‘THE F--K’ OUT

His second album, ""Unpredictable,"" was released in December 2005 and received Grammy nods, but it was his third album in 2008, ""Intuition,"" that turned the music world upside down.

""Blame It,"" featuring T-Pain, earned Foxx his first Grammy. He's been nominated a total of 10 times.

When ""Ray"" director Taylor Hackford approached Jamie about playing the role of the legendary musician Ray Charles in 2004, Hackford didn't know about Jamie's instrumental background and was blown away by Foxx's talent.

""Taylor didn’t know that I play piano, so he said, ‘I gotta figure out a way to shoot your face and then shoot somebody else’s hands playing.’ And I said, ‘No, no, I actually play. I’ve been playing since I was 5.’ That opened up a whole different thing,"" Foxx told the Jazz Times.

""Since I can play, we could stay in the same frame and shoot through the playing of the music and the singing at the same time, which was a huge plus.""

Foxx's world was turned upside down when his younger sister, DeOndra Dixon, died in October 2020. She was 36.

He wrote on social media at the time that his heart ""is shattered into a million pieces."" Foxx added DeOndra ""transitioned"" and said ""she will always be alive… anyone who knew my sis… knew that she was a bright light.""

Foxx continued, ""I can’t tell you how many times we have had parties at the house where she has got on the dance floor and stolen the show... even gave her boyfriend @chrisbrownofficial a run for his money... well I know she is in heaven now dancing with her wings on...tho my pain is unbelievable I smile when I think of all of the great memories that she left me... my family... and her friends.""

Jamie's sister danced in the ""Blame It"" video and also on the Grammys. He was proud of her accomplishments, especially becoming the ambassador to the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.

Shortly after her death, the foundation created the DeOndra Dixon Fund in her honor. Foxx told Extra two months after DeOndra died that their family was ""getting along"" as best they could.

""It was so much pain, man. My mother, my father and my sister, they all live with me. It was so much pain,"" he said.

The nonprofit sent a message of support to Jamie Thursday.

Dixon began participating in the Special Olympics in the sixth grade. She competed for nearly a decade and moved from her native Texas to California, where she lived with Foxx after graduating from high school in 2002.

""I feel I was born to dance. I want to be a professional dancer,"" Dixon’s foundation bio said. ""My brother has given me a chance to do some special things. I danced in his video ‘Blame It.’ I’ve danced on stage at some of his concerts all over the country. And guess what? I’ve danced at the Grammys!""

Jamie received an Academy Award for ""Ray"" the same year that he was nominated for best supporting actor in ""Collateral.""

He starred as a Los Angeles cab driver turned hostage by a hitman on a killing spree (Tom Cruise) in the neo-noir action flick directed by Michael Mann.

The star-studded cast included Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, and the film grossed more than $220 million at the box office. Months after its release, Cruise went public about his relationship with Katie Holmes.

Holmes and Cruise were married six years and have one daughter, Suri Cruise. They divorced in 2012.

Foxx and the ""Dawson's Creek"" star reportedly began dating in 2013 but kept their romance out of the spotlight for years.

They made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in 2019, six years into their relationship.

Weeks later, they were both single again.

"GOP states rip AOC, Dems for pushing Biden to ignore abortion pill ruling","EXCLUSIVE — A group of Republican attorneys general is demanding that Democrats retract their suggestion that the Biden administration should defy a court order aimed at stopping the distribution of the abortion pill mifepristone.

Last week, a federal judge in Texas signed an injunction that directed the FDA to halt its more than 20-year-old approval of mifepristone while a lawsuit challenging its safety and approval works its way through court.

Democrats were incensed by the ruling, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y., who said that the Biden administration should ""ignore"" it. She said ""deeply partisan"" judges have ""engaged in unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts.""

""The interesting thing when it comes to a ruling is that it relies on enforcement,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on CNN. ""And it is up to the Biden administration to enforce, to choose whether or not to enforce a ruling.""

Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., issued a similar statement that called on President Biden and the FDA to ignore the ruling that he said has no ""basis in law"" but is ""rooted in conservatives' dangerous and undemocratic takeover of our country's institutions.""

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said on CNN last week, ""What you saw — by that one judge, in that one court, in that one state — that’s not America.""

Nine Republican AGs say those statements are so egregious, the Democrats need to retract them ""or resign.""

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, along with eight other Republican AGs who filed briefs in support of the ruling, sent a letter to those outspoken Democrats that scolded them for their statements, which they said are ""akin to a call to overthrow the Constitution.""

""This is the most anti-rule of law administration we’ve had in recent history. The fact that Becerra is even considering this means he should resign immediately,"" Bailey told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""Expressing mere disagreement with a court order, as all attorneys have done, is nothing like your call for the FDA not to comply with a court order. The difference between the two is enormous. For a party to defy a court order simply because one does not like it is an attack on our very system of government and the rule of law,"" the AGs stated in the letter exclusively reviewed by Fox News Digital.

HHS SECRETARY SAYS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IGNORING FEDERAL JUDGE’S ABORTION PILL RULING IS ‘ON THE TABLE’

""You ought to know better,"" the AGs wrote. ""Like each of us, you have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution. Your anti-Constitution rhetoric is more than just wrong. It also erodes the culture of the rule of law that has taken centuries to build.

""Other nations have fallen into tyranny quickly when those who should have been upholding the rule of law chose instead to lead mobs against it. Your rash, inflammatory, anti-Constitution statements are unacceptable.

""You must retract or resign.""

On Wednesday, the 5th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled 2-1 to keep mifepristone available only to be dispensed up to seven weeks, not 10, and not by mail, a decision that partially overturned the Texas ruling.

On Thursday, the Justice Department weighed in by asking the Supreme Court to issue a stay on the entire injunction issued by the Texas judge.

"Calif Rep Katie Porter's ex-husband stands by domestic abuse allegations against her, contradicting campaign","EXCLUSIVE: The ex-husband of California Democrat Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter said he does ""not recant"" his domestic abuse allegations against the congresswoman after her campaign said that he did.

The allegations against Porter include claims that she dumped hot potatoes on her then-husband's head and smashed a glass that led to him being cut by flying shards. Porter has separately faced accusations of running a toxic, emotionally abusive workplace by former staffers.

According to divorce documents received by Fox News Digital, Porter and her ex-husband, Matt Hoffman, both filed domestic violence restraining orders against each other after an April 2013 altercation at the home they shared while legally separated.

Hoffman alleged that Porter hit him ""in the arm, causing a large bruise,"" dumped boiling potatoes on his head and ridiculed him as ""too dumb"" to have a cellphone. He said that the congresswoman ""waited all day, then called the police"" and ""made false allegations"" against him 11 hours after a confrontation while brushing their teeth the day the police were called to their residence.

Police arrested Hoffman on battery charges at the residence after the confrontation in April 2013. Porter requested the temporary restraining order the next day.

Documents obtained by Fox News Digital state that Hoffman regretted making the allegations against Porter in a court-ordered child custody evaluation, but it doesn't specify whether his regret was due to a lack of veracity or another reason.

Porter’s campaign told Fox News Digital that Hoffman had ""retracted"" his statement, but Hoffman said he did ""not recant"" his allegations against the congresswoman.

Hoffman said he did not ""recall stating I regretted making the allegations but, again, it's been a long time.""

""I do not recant the allegations,"" Hoffman added.

Porter’s spokesperson, Lindsay Reilly, told Fox News Digital that on ""the morning of the hearing on Porter’s request for a temporary restraining order following documented violence by her then-husband, her then-husband’s lawyer filed a reciprocal request for protection.""

""This common defensive tactic is designed to intimidate a victim. Her then-husband later admitted, as evidenced by the attached document, that ‘he regretted making these allegations,’"" Reilly said.

""Porter’s then-husband’s allegation was not supported by any evidence, other than his false and later retracted statement,"" she continued.

""Porter's account was supported by police accounts, a doctor's recommendation after a child custody evaluation, her sole request for a move-out order and property control, and ultimately a judge's decision granting her majority physical custody,"" Reilly added.

Porter has repeatedly denied the abuse allegations, which Hoffman made amid a contentious separation and divorce process in 2012 and 2013. But the accusations bubbled back to the surface after multiple former Porter staffers blew the whistle on what they described as Porter's toxic, emotionally abusive management style.

Porter and Hoffman separated in March 2013 and continued to live with each other until their divorce was finalized in December of that year, but the two alleged abuse from each other while living together during their separation.

Divorce filings obtained by Fox News Digital included 2012 allegations from Hoffman that Porter shattered a glass coffee pot after becoming angry over their dirty house, causing him to cut his hands and arms.

Hoffman also alleged that, while married, the congresswoman frequently berated him as a ""f---ing idiot"" and ""f---ing incompetent"" and dumped ""steaming hot potatoes"" on his head during a 2006 confrontation.

""She would not let me have a cellphone because she said, 'You're too f---ing dumb to operate it,'' Hoffman said in comments first resurfaced by the Daily Mail this week.

In her restraining order, Porter alleged Hoffman swore at her and called her names and ""grabbed both [of her] hands and squeezed"" during the April 2013 confrontation that led to his arrest.

The congresswoman also alleged that Hoffman had used his elbow to push her aside after rushing toward her, causing her to stumble and catch herself on a nearby bookshelf.

Porter said she went to find her daughter during the altercation and that Hoffman had yelled at her that she ""was ruining"" their family with the divorce.

""He would not let me leave. It seemed like five minutes or more that I was trapped in the laundry room with him,"" Porter said in the divorce documents.

""He told me that I better not call the police, because if I did, our children would go to foster care,"" Porter said. ""More terrifying, respondent then said, ‘Do you want me to kill myself? Is that what you are trying to make happen here?'""

Hoffman was the primary caretaker of the couple’s three children while Porter was the breadwinner for the family.

On April 30, 2013, Hoffman filed a restraining order with Orange County Superior Court the day before Porter’s temporary order was set to expire.

"Biden repeats long-debunked claim he ‘traveled 17,000 miles’ with Xi Jinping","President Biden repeated a long-debunked claim while addressing Ireland’s parliament Thursday, boasting that he ""traveled 17,000 miles"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

""I met more with Xi Jinping than any world leader has over the last 10 years – 91 hours of just one-on-one conversations, 68 in person, I traveled 17,000 miles with him through Asia, primarily, and through China,"" the president said.

""He once asked me on the Tibetan Plateau, he said, ‘Can you define America for me?’ It's the God's truth. I said, ‘Yes, I can, in one word,"" he added. ""Possibilities.""

Biden previously made the ""17,000 miles"" the claim in November, prompting Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler to give the president a ""bottomless Pinocchio"" rating, meaning he had said it over 20 times during his presidency up to that point.

Kessler previously fact-checked Biden’s claim in February 2021, calling it ""bogus,"" saying he could only confirm one instance in which Biden and Xi appeared to have traveled together when they visited Qingchengshan High School in Dujiangyan when he was vice president in August 2011.

""This was a reference to the total travel back and forth — both internally in the U. S. and China, and as well as internationally — for meetings they held together,"" a White House official explained at the time. ""Some travel was in parallel, some was separately to joint destinations.""

"Trump’s GOP rivals try to grab media coverage, but he dominates with Fox interview","Nikki Haley ranks high on the list of Republicans who don’t want to directly criticize Donald Trump.

In fact, she deflects every question about the front-runner and insists only the media are asking her about this.

But she came up with a not-so-subtle method of taking a few swipes at her rivals. It’s called the confidential memo. And I can’t exactly say it has no fingerprints.

The Haley campaign simply leaked the memo to Axios – which touted it as a scoop. An Axios reporter confirmed it came from the campaign (duh). And a leaked memo is sexier to journalists than, say, a sitdown interview.

MAJORITY OF DEMS OPPOSE BIDEN RUN

Haley has raised $11 million in six weeks, and the memo from campaign manager Betsy Ankney says: ""Donald Trump had a pretty good Q1, if you count being indicted as 'good.'""

""Still, it’s increasingly clear that Trump’s candidacy is more consumed by the grievances of the past and the promise of more drama in the future, rather than a forward-looking vision for the American people."" Perfectly fair shots – but why couldn’t Haley say these things herself? Who is she fooling? Perhaps she thinks she’s avoiding a Trump counterattack by laundering it through the press. The memo also says of Ron DeSantis that he’s ""not ready for prime time.""

Still, the memo didn’t make much news, not in this environment. Sen. Tim Scott announced a presidential exploratory committee yesterday. Which means he’s running.

The Senate’s only black Republican is an attractive candidate with a compelling life story, which he summarizes as ""from cotton to Congress.""

In a video, Scott stressed his optimistic message: ""I know America is a land of opportunity, not a land of oppression. I know it because I lived it."" But given the nature of today’s GOP, Scott has to be regarded as a long shot. And as more Republicans jump in, they increase the chances of Trump cruising to the nomination as they divide the opposition vote.

BIDEN FADES FROM NEWS AMID TRUMP MELODRAMA

Both Haley and Scott got a sliver of the coverage that Trump attracted, not surprisingly, by sitting down with Fox’s Tucker Carlson.

The former president was full of provocative responses, such as saying he’ll stay in the race even if he’s convicted in the Stormy Daniels case. When he was brought in for the arraignment, ""They were actually crying. They said ‘I'm sorry.’ They'd say ‘2024, sir, 2024.’ And tears are pouring down their eyes.""

Will Joe Biden stay in the race?

""Look, I watch him just like you do, and I think it's almost inappropriate for me to say it. But I deal with other people. I don't see – I don't see how it's possible.

And it's not an age thing.""

Then what is it?

Trump delivered his standard riff about the president being surrounded by ""smart"" but ""vicious"" left-wingers, as if Biden isn’t really in charge.

In a particularly strange series of exchanges, Trump said Biden ""is not top of the line"" and then proceeded to praise dictators around the globe.

Vladimir Putin? ""Very smart,"" said Trump, despite the fact that he has decimated his military and committed countless war crimes by invading Ukraine.

""People ask me, how smart is Xi? I say, top of the line. You've never met anybody smarter. How smart is Kim Jong-un? Top of the line.""

But was Kim, who inherited his job, smart enough to make a nuclear deal with Trump? No.

Whether you agree or disagree with Trump’s comments, they’re all designed to generate buzz and be replayed (and even denounced) on television.

Arnold Schwarzenegger filling a pothole sparks controversy within city of Los Angeles,"After being hailed a hero for filling in a pothole in his Brentwood, California, community, Arnold Schwarzenegger's good deed has not gone unpunished, with the city claiming he interrupted scheduled maintenance for a service trench.

A city spokesperson clarified that the location ""is not a pothole,"" but rather ""a service trench that relates to active, permitted work being performed at the location by SoCalGas, who expects the work to be completed by the end of May"" in a statement given to NBC Los Angeles.

A city spokesperson later told Fox News Digital that work began on Jan. 26 to ""upgrade the pipeline system on Mandeville Canyon Road,"" where temporary paving was applied. Standard procedure followed by SoCalGas includes permanently paving the area within approximately 30 days from the conclusion of work, however the city saw complications due to ""extraordinary wet and inclement weather."" The expectation now is that they will be finished by the end of the week.

A representative for Schwarzenegger believes the city is ""being careful with their wording to imply Arnold prevented their gas line work without directly saying it, because it's not true.""

Who are the Artemis II astronauts?,"The Artemis II astronauts were named in a historic announcement on Monday.

The astronauts include NASA's Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman and Christina Hammock Koch, and the Canadian Space Agency's Jeremy Hansen.

All four will venture around the moon no sooner than late 2024. They'll be the first to fly NASA's Orion space capsule and will lift off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on a Space Launch System rocket.

NASA NAMES CREW OF FIRST MANNED MISSION TO MOON IN OVER 50 YEARS

The approximately 10-day trip takes them around the moon and back to Earth.

""The Artemis II crew represents thousands of people working tirelessly to bring us to the stars. This is their crew, this is our crew, this is humanity's crew,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said at a ceremony in Texas. ""NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Hammock Koch and CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen, each has their own story, but, together, they represent our creed: E pluribus unum – out of many, one. Together, we are ushering in a new era of exploration for a new generation of star sailors and dreamers – the Artemis Generation.""

The team, all in their 40s, is the first moon crew in 50 years and includes the first woman and the first African American assigned to a lunar mission. NASA picked from 41 active astronauts and Canada had four candidates.

NASA aims to land two astronauts on the moon by around 2025.

This will be the second trip into space for Reid Wiseman, who previously served as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station in 2014.

He has logged more than 165 days in space and served as the chief of the Astronaut Office from December 2020 until November 2022.

This is the second spaceflight for Glover, who previously served as the pilot on NASA’s SpaceX Crew-1, which landed after 168 days in space in May 2021.

A southern California native, Glover was selected as an astronaut in 2013 while serving as a Legislative Fellow in the U. S. Senate.

""This is a big day. We have a lot to celebrate and it’s so much more than the four names that have been announced,"" the naval aviator said.

Glover was also a test pilot in the F/A‐18 Hornet, Super Hornet and EA‐18G Growler.

This will also be the second flight into space for Koch, who holds the world record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman and participated in the first all-female spacewalks.

The Michigan native served as flight engineer aboard the space station for Expedition 59, 60 and 61.

""Am I excited? Absolutely,"" Koch said. ""But my real question is: ‘Are you excited?’""

Her career began as an Electrical Engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where she contributed to scientific instruments on several NASA space science missions.

Hansen is making his first flight to space.

A colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces and former fighter pilot, Hansen was one of two recruits selected by CSA in May 2009 through the third Canadian Astronaut Recruitment Campaign and has served as Capcom in NASA's Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center and, in 2017, became the first Canadian to be entrusted with leading a NASA astronaut class.

Terrifyingly powerful cyclone forces northwest Australia evacuations,"A tropical cyclone is forecast to be the most powerful storm to hit Australia in eight years, bringing extraordinary wind speeds that could take some Western Australia residents by surprise.

Tropical Storm Ilsa will cross the northwest Pilbara coast, where cyclones are common. It is expected to make landfall between the iron ore export town of Port Hedland and the Wallal Downs Station cattle ranch.

The storm is projected to bring wind gusts of up to 196 miles per hour, according to meteorologists.

The category 5 cyclone strengthened over the Indian Ocean on Thursday and was expected to maintained that destructive level early Friday, per the Australia Bureau of Meteorology.

Category 5 cyclones have mean wind speeds exceeding 124 miles per hour, with gusts exceeding 174 miles per hour.

The last category 5 storm in Australia was Cyclone Marcia in 2015. That storm caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in Queensland.

The Category 5 Cyclone Veronica did not cross the Pilbara cost in March 2019, but damaged infrastructure and disrupted the region’s mining and offshore gas industry.

Ahead of this cyclone, police have closed the highway along the Pilbara coast, and officials expect that the North West Coastal Highway will be impassable due to flooding.

Many in Ilsa's path have evacuated the area, including ranchers, miners, indigenous locals and tourists.

People who were living in structures not built to withstand a Category 4 storm were told to leave, according to Department of Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm.

He said that extra emergency workers, essential supplies and aircraft have also been sent to the region.

The weather bureau has also warned about rainfall and abnormally high tides, with people advised to avoid coastal and low-lying spots.

""Any areas ... where that system does cross the coast are going to experience some very destructive winds, winds in excess of 200 kph (124 mph). They’re going to cause a lot of damage,"" bureau manager Todd Smith told reporters on Wednesday.

Study reveals how life survived on ‘Snowball Earth’,"Life on our planet faced a stern test during the Cryogenian Period that lasted from 720 million to 635 million years ago when Earth twice was frozen over with runaway glaciation and looked from space like a shimmering white snowball.

Life somehow managed to survive during this time called ""Snowball Earth,"" and a new study offers a deeper understanding as to why.

Fossils identified as seaweed unearthed in black shale in central China's Hubei Province indicate that habitable marine environments were more widespread at the time than previously known, scientists said on Tuesday. The findings support the idea that it was more of a ""Slushball Earth"" where the earliest forms of complex life - basic multicellular organisms - endured even at mid-latitudes previously thought to have been frozen solid.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE ‘NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED’

The fossils date from the second of the two times during the Cryogenian Period when massive ice sheets stretched from the poles toward the equator. This interval, called the Marinoan Ice Age, lasted from about 651 million to 635 million years ago.

""The key finding of this study is that open-water - ice-free - conditions existed in mid-latitude oceanic regions during the waning stage of the Marinoan Ice Age,"" said China University of Geosciences geobiologist Huyue Song, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature Communications.

""Our study shows that, at least near the end of the Marinoan 'Snowball Earth' event, habitable areas extended to mid-latitude oceans, much larger than previously thought. Previous research argued that such habitable areas, at best, only existed in tropical oceans. More extensive areas of habitable oceans better explain where and how complex organisms such as multicellular seaweed survived,"" Song added.

The findings demonstrate that the world's oceans were not completely frozen and that habitable refuges existed where multicellular eukaryotic organisms - the domain of life including plants, animals, fungi and certain mostly single-celled organisms called protists - could survive, Song said.

Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The first single-celled organisms arose sometime during roughly the first billion years of the planet's existence. Multicellular organisms arrived later, perhaps 2 billion years ago. But it was only in the aftermath of the Cryogenian that warmer conditions returned, paving the way for a rapid expansion of different life forms about 540 million years ago.

Scientists are trying to better understand the onset of ""Snowball Earth."" They believe a greatly reduced amount of the sun's warmth reached the planet's surface as solar radiation bounced off the white ice sheets.

""It is widely believed that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels plummeted just prior to these events, causing the polar ice caps to expand and hence more solar radiation reflected back to space and the polar ice caps expanded further. And the Earth spiraled into Snowball Earth conditions,"" Virginia Tech geobiologist and study co-author Shuhai Xiao said.

Seaweed and fossils of some other multicellular organisms were identified in the black shale. This seaweed - a rudimentary plant - was a photosynthetic organism living on the seafloor in a shallow marine environment lit by sunlight.

""The fossils were preserved as compressed sheets of organic carbon,"" China University of Geosciences paleontologist and study co-author Qin Ye said.

Multicellular organisms including red algae, green algae and fungi emerged before the Cryogenian and survived ""Snowball Earth.""

The Cryogenian freeze was much worse than the most recent Ice Age that humans survived, ending roughly 10,000 years ago.

""Compared to the most recent Ice Age, glacier coverage was much more extensive and, more importantly, much of the ocean was frozen,"" Xiao said.

""It is fair to say that the 'Snowball Earth' events were significant challenges to life on Earth,"" Xiao added. ""It is conceivable that these 'Snowball Earth' events could have driven major extinctions, but apparently life, including complex eukaryotic organisms, managed to survive, attesting to the resilience of the biosphere.""",2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z

Crypto investors face delays in withdrawing funds after Ethereum upgrade,"Cryptocurrency investors are facing delays to withdraw funds deposited on the Ethereum blockchain after its major software upgrade, highlighting persistent headaches for Ethereum which aims to have the technology widely used for instant payments.

The software upgrade, known as ""Shapella,"" was set to unlock more than $30 billion worth of ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency, which investors had deposited on the Ethereum blockchain in return for interest.

Until Wednesday's upgrade, investors could not withdraw funds they had deposited via this method, known as ""staking,"" on the Ethereum blockchain.

As of Thursday, ether worth around $1.4 billion was stuck in a withdrawal queue, blockchain data firm Nansen said.

WARREN BUFFETT CRITICIZES BITCOIN, SAYS IT 'DOESN'T HAVE ANY INTRINSIC VALUE'

The delays are an example of the limits in the transactions that Ethereum can process, highlighting its potential shortcomings as it strives to become a widely-used financial infrastructure.

The Ethereum Foundation, a body that speaks for the network, did not immediately comment.

The delays are due to limits in the amount of transactions the blockchain can process, Nansen analyst Martin Lee told Reuters via email. It can process approximately 1,800 validator withdrawals, or 57,600 ether worth of exits per day, he said - that's approximately $115 million.

The limits on validator withdrawals were in place for security reasons, Lee said.

""In an extreme scenario, if there’s no limits, and a large majority of validators exit, the Ethereum network would be vulnerable to attacks and bad actors,"" he said.

Ethereum has grown popular for offshoots of the crypto market such as so-called decentralised finance or NFTs, but it has yet to become used in mainstream payments, finance or commerce.

The major Binance exchange said users would be able to withdraw their ether from its staking product from April 19, and that it may take ""15 days to several weeks"" to process these transactions.

""Due to the processing limitations on the Ethereum network, Binance will set a daily ETH redemption quota for each Binance user,"" Binance said on its website.

Could the US dollar lose its reserve currency status to China?,"The rise of China as an economic powerhouse in global trade in recent decades has sparked concerns about the long-term status of the U. S. dollar as the world’s primary reserve currency, which it has been since the end of World War II.

China recently announced a deal with Brazil to denominate more of their bilateral trade in their own currencies instead of the dollar. China is also in talks to buy oil from Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich Gulf countries in its currency rather than the dollar. Those developments have given rise to speculation that China’s renminbi (also known as the yuan) could eventually overtake the dollar as the world’s preferred trading currency.

The dollar’s status as the world’s leading reserve currency brings several benefits to the U. S. economy. Strong demand for dollars and dollar-backed securities like Treasury bonds reduces borrowing costs to the U.S. government, businesses and consumers due to lower interest rates. The dollar’s dominance also makes it cheaper to buy imports, reduces transaction costs and insulates the U.S. economy from exchange rate fluctuations that would otherwise impact borrowers if their loans were denominated in foreign currency.

IMF PROJECTS SLOWEST RATE OF GROWTH IN DECADES, URGES ‘SUPPORT’ FROM WEALTHIER COUNTRIES

There are some drawbacks, however, as it makes it harder for U. S.-based exporters to compete with their overseas rivals. Coupled with cheaper imports, that dynamic can lead to trade deficits — meaning the U.S. imports more than it exports — that can be challenging to reverse. According to Commerce Department data, the U.S. last had a trade surplus in 1975.

Shifts in the world’s leading reserve currency tend to take time to play out. The U. S. dollar gradually replaced the British pound sterling as the leading international currency over the course of several decades in the 20th century, which saw two World Wars, the Great Depression and the unwinding of the British Empire. That period coincided with the U.S. surpassing Britain as the world’s largest economy and exporter.

CHINA, MALAYSIA TO DISCUSS ASIAN MONETARY FUND TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON US DOLLAR

Despite the numerous economic and geopolitical events in the decades since the end of World War II, the dollar’s status as the world’s dominant currency has remained intact — having been involved in about 90% of annual global currency transactions, according to the Bank of International Settlements.

The dollar’s share of foreign currency reserves was around 70% in 1999 and 2000, and although it has trended down slightly over the last decade from above 60% to just below that threshold, it remains well above the other foreign currencies held as reserves. The chart below uses official foreign currency reserve data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to compare holdings of the dollar to its four largest peers — the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound sterling and the Chinese renminbi:

In the IMF’s most recent data from the fourth quarter of 2022, U. S. dollars account for about 58.4% of currency reserves, followed by euros at 20.5%, Japan’s yen at 5.5%, the British pound at 5% and China’s renminbi at 2.7%.

Unlike most advanced economies worldwide, China does not have a floating exchange rate under which the value of its currency is determined by market forces.

From 1994 to 2005, China pegged its currency at about 8 yuan to the dollar. It then began to allow its currency to appreciate slightly against the dollar within a fixed limit before it shifted its peg to a basket of several currencies used by major trading partners, including the U. S. and its dollar. The People’s Bank of China allows its currency to trade in a 2% range around a midpoint it fixes against the dollar each day.

CHINA CONTINUES TO LEAD WORLD IN COUNTERFEIT AND PIRATED PRODUCTS: USTR REPORT

The Chinese government’s primary goal with this policy is to boost the country’s exports, particularly in manufactured goods, which have fueled its rapid industrialization and grown the country’s middle class.

China’s capital controls also limit the ability of the renminbi to grow as a reserve currency because it restricts residents from moving money out of China. The government has historically limited foreign investment in the country — particularly in its bond market — through the use of quotas to cap in-flows.

Capital controls have primarily been applied to Chinese investors rather than to foreign investors, but nonetheless, they continue to pose a liquidity risk in the event that the Chinese government decides to prevent money from leaving the country. Central banks have to consider liquidity risk when evaluating what currencies to hold in reserve.

By contrast, the market for U. S.

The galaxy, named PBC J2333.9-2343, has changed classification due to the unique activity within its core. It was previously classified as a radio galaxy, but the new research released in March has revealed otherwise.

Located more than 656 million light-years away, it is now classified as a giant radio galaxy that has a blazar in its core.

Blazars are a type of galaxy powered by a black hole. They shoot jets of high-energy particles that move at rates close to the speed of light toward Earth, making them appear as bright spots.

UK SCIENTISTS FIND ONE OF LARGEST BLACK HOLES EVER DISCOVERED

The international group of astronomers said their findings revealed in this galaxy the jet had changed its direction drastically and is now pointing ""directly towards us.""

They observed the galaxy across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, including with radio, optical, infrared, X-ray, ultraviolet and gamma ray telescopes. Then they compared the properties of the galaxy with large samples of blazars and non-blazar galaxies.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE 'NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED'

""We started to study this galaxy as it showed peculiar properties,"" explained lead author Dr. Lorena Hernández-García, a researcher at the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics. ""Our hypothesis was that the relativistic jet of its supermassive black hole had changed its direction, and to confirm that idea we had to carry out a lot of observations.""

In this galaxy, the jet is believed to originate from close to the supermassive black hole at its center.

""With the jet pointing in our direction, the emission is strongly enhanced and can easily exceed that coming from the rest of the galaxy. This, in turn, drives high-intensity flares stronger than those coming from other radio galaxies, thus changing its categorization,"" the Royal Astronomical Society said in a release.

The orientation of the jets helps determine how a galaxy is classified. When galaxy cores have jets appearing to shoot out perpendicularly, they are called quasars. With jets both in the plane of the school and with one directed at us, this galaxy was reclassified as a radio galaxy with a blazar at its center.

While changes in the direction of jets have been reported before, this marks the first time that such a phenomenon has been observed where it does not suggest the presence of two different phases of jet activity from its formation observed at radio frequencies.

The release said the direction change appears to have taken place in the same nuclear outburst originating from the blazar's active galactic nucleus, the active supermassive black hole.

While the team does not yet know what caused the shift in the direction of jets, its scientists speculated it could have been due to a merging event with another galaxy or any other relatively large object or a strong burst of activity in the galactic nucleus after a dormant period.

The work is published in a paper in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z
"Leaked intel, found on social media, shows Ukraine more vulnerable than US claims","China has again blockaded Taiwan in a military exercise designed to intimidate not just the democratic country but western powers as well. The supposed cause was Kevin McCarthy meeting with the Taiwanese president. And while the U. S. has pledged to defend Taiwan, it’s hard not to wonder what would happen if American troops were sent to a group of islands just off China’s coast.

The Biden team tried to bury a report before Easter weekend that said it should have begun the U. S. withdrawal from Afghanistan much sooner. Administration officials, inexplicably, denied that the exit was chaotic, but one thing we know is that it was deadly, with 13 U.S. service members killed by a deadly bomb.

And now the secret American intelligence floating around social media raises a series of alarms – including how it got there – that we’re just beginning to grasp.

The intel paints a much darker picture of Ukraine’s ability to fight off the Russians. This directly contradicts the president’s reassurances that the war is going well.

Which brings to mind the phrase ""credibility gap,"" popularized during the Vietnam War. With LBJ, Robert McNamara and Gen. William Westmoreland reassuring the press and public that the war was going well, it was all the more shocking to learn that the jungle war was a disaster. Their light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel rhetoric was a pack of lies, as was clear not just from the Pentagon papers but from the desperate U. S. evacuation from Saigon in 1975.

The leaked intel documents reveal, as the Washington Post put it, ""Ukraine’s challenges in massing troops, ammunition and equipment could cause its military to fall ‘well short’ of Kyiv’s original goals for an anticipated counteroffensive aimed at retaking Russian-occupied areas this spring."" This shines a light on ""Washington’s misgivings about the state of the war.""

Even more worrisome, Volodymyr Zelensky could soon run out of ammunition for their anti-missile systems, which date to the Soviet era. How is this possible, with all the weaponry the U. S. and NATO countries have provided? Or is it just too hard to keep up with the Russian military machine?

Ukraine wants to cut off the Kremlin’s access to Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014, but its deficiencies in training and weapons ""probably will strain progress and exacerbate casualties during the offensive.""

LEAKED PENTAGON DOCUMENTS PAINT GRIM PICTURE OF UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE SUPPLIES, MAY ONLY LAST A MONTH

Fortunately, the leaked intel also says that Russia suffers from bad morale and poorly equipped soldiers.

What’s grabbing headlines now is the revelation that the U. S. spied on Ukraine, South Korea and Israel, as well as adversaries. This should come as a shock to no one, as word has dribbled out over the years that even friendly countries spy on each other. A source close to Zelenskyy told CNN that Ukraine has changed some of its military plans because of the documents becoming public.

As for the origins of the leak, the New York Times reports ""a surprisingly large number of people potentially had access to the Pentagon intelligence documents."" We’re talking about hundreds of people. That sounds like an abject failure, since these are among the nation’s most sensitive military secrets.

""We don’t know who is behind this, we don’t know what the motive is,"" national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters.

Kirby also said the leaked material ""has no business, if you don’t mind me saying, on the front pages of newspapers, or on television. It is not intended for public consumption, and it should not be out there.""

That horse is already out of the barn, with major news outlets carrying a series of stories about the documents.

They first popped up last month on the social media site Discord, and went unnoticed for awhile. Discord says it is cooperating with a DOJ leak investigation.

In the old days – a few short years ago – leakers would give secret material to one or more news organizations. Those outlets would have to weigh whether some of the material would jeopardize American soldiers or operatives, and often there would be conversations with the White House.

""I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever,"" Bündchen said at the time. ""If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him, believe me. I want him to achieve and to conquer. I want all his dreams to come true. That’s what I want, really, from the bottom of my heart.""

She left another inspirational post at the beginning of March, saying ""When life gets challenging always remember that the sun rises everyday bringing a new opportunity for us to try again and do better.

"Jobless claims unexpectedly climb to 239,000 as layoffs grow","The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, evidence the labor market is beginning to soften in the face of higher borrowing costs.

Figures released Thursday by the Labor Department show initial claims for the week ended April 8 rose by 11,000 to 239,000. That is above the 2019 pre-pandemic average of 218,000 claims.

Continuing claims, filed by Americans who are consecutively receiving unemployment benefits, fell slightly to 1.81 million for the week ended April 1, a decrease of 13,000 from the previous week.

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, but there are growing signs of a slowdown.

The economy added just 236,000 jobs in March, the lowest monthly gain since December 2020.

A separate report released last week showed there were about 9.9 million job openings in February, the first time since May 2021 that the number of available jobs dipped below 10 million.

There has also been a wave of notable layoffs over the past few months, and the list grows longer by the day. Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Lyft, Facebook, Google, IBM and Twitter are among the companies letting workers go.

Central bank officials have made it clear that they expect unemployment to climb as a result of higher rates, which could force consumers and businesses to pull back on spending. Job losses are ""very likely,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers earlier in March.

Projections from the central bank's March meeting show that officials expect unemployment to rise to 4.6% by the end of next year, up from the current rate of 3.5%.

That could mean more than 1 million Americans lose their jobs between now and the end of 2023.

Policymakers have already approved nine consecutive rate increases and have opened the door to a 10th increase at their next meeting in early May, although they have stressed the importance of upcoming economic data releases.

'Princess Bride' star Cary Elwes shares thoughts on possibility of reboot,"Cary Elwes, star of the beloved 1987 cult fantasy film ""The Princess Bride,"" doesn’t think there’s a shot at it ever being remade

Elwes told ""E! News"" in a recent interview, ""There's no reboot.""

He continued, ""There was a studio head one time who suggested that, and he posted it on Twitter, and I responded, 'There's a shortage of perfect movies in this world. It would be a pity to damage this one.'""

The 60-year-old actor had responded to a 2019 tweet from Variety in which Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Tony Vinciquerra had told the outlet, ""Very famous people whose names I won't use, but they want to redo ‘The Princess Bride.’""

'THE PRINCESS BRIDE' CAST: WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

Elwes paraphrased one of his more famous quotes from the movie in his response, and he said that it ""got quite a sizeable response of positive feedback"" at the time.

He added a definitive opinion: ""I don't think you can touch it.""

""The Princess Bride,"" based on the 1973 novel of the same name, premiered in 1987 and celebrated its 35th anniversary last year. It wasn’t a box-office hit when it first played in theaters, but over the decades it has become a family favorite for many people, with its quotable lines and memorable moments.

The closest the film has come to being remade was in 2020 during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, when dozens of celebrities recreated the movie shot for shot and line for line at home with improvised costumes and props. Elwes even appeared, but instead recreating his role as the hero Westley, he played the evil Prince Humperdinck.

The charming recreations were broadcast on the now-defunct Quibi.

"T. rex may have had big scaly lips, study says","The better to kiss you with? The Tyrannosaurus rex may have had scaly lips that covered their teeth.

Researchers said depictions of the predator with giant flashing teeth, fully visible, might be incorrect.

In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, paleontologists compared skulls and living reptiles.

Their findings distorted the image of the classic ""Jurassic Park"" series, finding that the teeth on the T. rex and other big theropods were likely covered by the lips. The teeth did not stick out when its mouth was closed, with just lips visible even in a wide open bite.

BIGGEST PENGUIN IN HISTORY WAS 'MONSTER BIRD,' WEIGHED OVER 300 POUNDS

Some large monitor lizards actually have bigger teeth than T. rex compared to their skull size and can still fit them under a set of scaly lips, according to study author Thomas Cullen, a paleontologist and assistant professor at Auburn University.

""We reconstructed soft tissue anatomy, compared dental measurements and studied dental health and wear records to further uncover that what you are used to seeing on the big screen is not accurate,"" he said in a release from the university. ""The teeth of these theropod dinosaurs did not experience wear and tear like a crocodile, and most likely had a lip-like covering.""

Examining wear and tear on teeth also pointed to these conclusions.

Analyzing a tooth from T. rex relative Daspletosaurus, it was found to be in good condition and did not show an uneven damage pattern – something exhibited in creatures with teeth sticking out of their mouths.

""This changes our perceptions about the appearance and oral configuration of these iconic predators and has broad implications for our interpretations of other terrestrial animals with large teeth,"" the authors said.

CHRISTIE'S PULLS T. REX SHEN FROM AUCTION FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ABOUT SKELETON: REPORT

Auburn said measurements taken from the ""SUE"" T. rex skeleton – which resides at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History – played an important part in the study.

The museum says SUE is physically the largest T. rex specimen discovered and the most complete, at around 90%.

This research is the latest in a long back-and-forth over how dinosaur mouths really looked and is not the first time depictions of the T. rex and dinosaurs have been called into question.

For example, other research has shown that T. rex was more hunched over than initially believed, and that velociraptors likely had feathers.

Most of what we know about dinosaurs comes from their bones, but it can be harder to get clear answers about soft tissues like skin, which are not usually preserved as fossils.

Cullen noted that dinosaur lips would be ""very different from our lips, in that although they would cover the teeth, they could not really be moved independently, couldn’t be curled back into a snarl, or make other sorts of movements we associate with lips in humans (or other mammals).""

""In this way, dinosaur lips would be more similar to those of many lizards or amphibians, even if we typically associate the structure of lips with mammals like ourselves,"" he explained.

'Unruly' pro-abortion protesters removed from Florida House gallery after throwing debris at lawmakers,"Pro-abortion protesters gathered at the Florida State Capitol on Thursday were forced out of the House gallery after they interrupted proceedings and began throwing debris at lawmakers who were deliberating a measure that would ban abortions after six weeks.

The incident took place as the Florida House of Representatives debated and voted on amendments to Senate Bill 300, an abortion bill that successfully passed in the state Senate earlier this month.

""The Speaker just ordered the Sargent at Arms to clear the gallery after protestors started throwing things at lawmakers,"" Spencer Roach, a Republican who represents the Sunshine State's 79th House district, wrote in a tweet.

Roach's tweet included footage of the protesters standing outside the chamber chanting, ""No justice, no peace.""

""These abortion-on-demand activists will not intimidate or deter us from protecting the unborn,"" Roach wrote in another tweet.

Speaking to Fox News Digital about the incident, Roach said protesters had become ""unruly"" in the gallery and were removed after being ""reprimanded"" for disturbances as the lawmakers debated the amendments.

""He gave a warning and said, 'The next time it happens, I'm gonna clear the gallery,' and it happened again. He ordered the sergeant of arms to clear the gallery,"" Roach said. ""Clearly, they were prepared for this moment and this was their plan all along. They started throwing debris and some papers down on the floor on lawmakers.""

Roach said the behavior from the pro-abortion protesters ""does expose a vulnerability"" in the fact that lawmakers could get injured if they are hit with heavier objects by those in the gallery in the future.

Another video shared by Brendon Leslie, the CEO of Florida's Voice, showed a chaotic scene as rowdy protesters tossed ""garbage"" and other papers at lawmakers from the House gallery as they voted on amendments to the bill.

""Leftwing activists throw garbage at lawmakers while they’re voting on amendments to bills,"" Leslie said of the footage, which was provided by Florida State University's WFSU-TV and The Florida Channel.

Demonstrators were also filmed chanting ""F--- around, find out"" after they were removed from the House gallery by Capitol security.

The bill making its way through the state legislature has faced strong criticism from Democrats and pro-abortion activists both locally and across the nation.

Florida House Democrats were also photographed joining in on the protests outside the chamber, according to Mitch Perry, a reporter for the Florida Phoenix.

""Florida House Democrats join protest against 6 week abortion bill taking place right outside the House chamber (they've since returned back to the chamber),"" Perry wrote in a tweet. ""Republicans have rejected every amendment Dems have introduced this morning.""

Earlier this month, Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried and state Democratic Sen. Lauren Book were two of 11 people arrested by the Tallahassee Police Department after they refused to leave an area outside the Tallahassee City Hall that had been designated by officers as a spot to protest the measure peacefully.

City officials worked with protest organizers for over a week but determined that the protest could not be accommodated because of the expected size of the crowd and plans of camping overnight. When the group arrived at City Hall, officials allowed them to protest during normal operating hours but told them to leave at sundown or face arrest.

Most of the crowd departed after sunset, but 11 people refused to leave after numerous requests, the city’s press release noted. They were ultimately arrested for trespassing.

Although the state Senate passed the six-week abortion ban, the bill still needs approval from the House before it reaches the desk of Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The state currently allows abortions up to 15 weeks, but if this bill is approved, it moves the state more in line with other Republican-led states.

"Postal Service upping first-class stamp prices to 66 cents, blames inflation","The U. S. Postal Service proposed raising the price of first-class mail stamps from 63 to 66 cents this week, the second price hike so far this year.

Stamp prices have nearly doubled over the past two decades, increasing from just 37 cents in 2002.

USPS most recently upped prices from 60 cents to 63 cents in January. If the proposed hike to 66 cents is approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission, then it will take effect in July.

""As operating expenses fueled by inflation continue to rise and the effects of a previously defective pricing model are still being felt, these price adjustments are needed to provide the Postal Service with much-needed revenue to achieve the financial stability sought by its Delivering for America 10-year plan,"" the USPS explained this week.

"Princess Margaret endured ‘a deep sadness’ on her deathbed over ‘forbidden’ lover Peter Townsend, doc claims","Princess Margaret spent her final days reminiscing about her true love.

The claim was made by George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, in a new ITVX docuseries titled ""The Real Crown: Inside the House of Windsor."" The five-part documentary aims to examine the struggles the British royal family has endured over the years.

Carey, who was Archbishop between 1996 and 2002, revealed in the documentary that he visited Queen Elizabeth II’s younger sister on her deathbed in 2002.

""She was sad,"" he recalled, as quoted by U. K.’s Daily Mail. ""There were moments when she expressed that sadness.""

""Here is a woman who longed for love and commitment, and the love of her life was forbidden from her, and there was a deep human sadness in that,"" he shared.

The princess first met Peter Townsend in 1947 when she was 17 years old. She quickly fell head over heels for the dashing World War II fighter pilot who was married with two sons.

A year after Townsend divorced his first wife, he proposed to Margaret, who was 16 years his junior, in 1953. At the time, divorcées weren’t allowed to remarry in the Church of England. Margaret also required her sister’s permission to marry before the age of 25.

Despite the couple’s love for each other, the much-decorated war ace was banished from Buckingham Palace on the advice of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill to a diplomatic post in Brussels. Still, the romance survived, at least until 1955. At the time, Margaret was 25 and third in line to the throne. That year, she ended her engagement with Townsend.

""I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage,"" Margaret said in a statement to BBC Radio at the time.

""But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others,"" she shared. ""I have reached this decision entirely alone, and in doing so I have been strengthened by the unfailing support and devotion of Group Captain Townsend.""

After the couple called it quits, Townsend moved to Belgium before settling down in France. Then in 1959, he married Marie-Luce Jamagne.

""[Margaret] could have married me only if she had been prepared to give up everything – her position, her prestige, her privy purse,"" Townsend later reflected in his 1978 memoir. ""I simply hadn’t the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.""

In 1960, Margaret became engaged to Antony Armstrong-Jones. It was a quick engagement, with the couple saying, ""I do"" mere months later. But the union wasn’t to last. The pair divorced in 1978, two years after they separated.

Townsend died in 1995. He was 80.

Looking back, Carey said he believed that Margaret died with a ""deep sadness"" about her lost love.

""I talked to her quietly and said a prayer, anointed her with the oil, and she died soon after that,"" he said. ""It was a lovely moving occasion.""

""Many of the working people who are the foundation of LA's tourism economy, working in LA hotels and at LAX, are struggling to survive on the city’s current living wage, facing housing and food insecurity, or forced to work two jobs,"" Price said.

The proposal would impact those employed at Los Angeles hotels with 60 or more rooms and workers in certain fields at LAX such as janitors, airplane cabin cleaners, security officers and airline catering employees.

""Tourism brings billions of dollars to our economy, and the businesses benefiting from tourism workers’ labor can afford to provide good jobs with fair wages,"" Price tweeted. ""The living wage movement is a social justice movement where here in Los Angeles nearly 9 out 10 tourism workers are people of color.""

Lawmakers have previously noted the cost of living in Southern California and inflation have made it difficult for workers, especially those with families, to sustain themselves as wages struggle to keep up.

The proposal comes as Los Angeles prepares to host big-name events in the coming years like the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games, which are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue.

Dutch researchers make giant meatball using mammoth DNA,"Dutch researchers were able to create a massive meatball of flesh grown using the DNA of a wooly mammoth this week.

A team of scientists put the fleshy blob on display at the NEMO science museum in the Netherlands. The team manufactured the girth with the help of an Australian cultured meat company, Vow, which has entertained the possibility of mass production and sale of the meat.

""We wanted to create something that was totally different from anything you can get now,"" Vow founder Tim Noakesmith told Reuters. ""Its protein is literally 4,000 years old. We haven't seen it in a very long time. That means we want to put it through rigorous tests, something that we would do with any product we bring to the market.""

Vow's team used sheep cells as a base for the growth before inserting a single myoglobin gene from a mammoth. Myoglobin is responsible for the smell, color and taste properties of meat. The team says the meat currently smells similar to crocodile flesh.

SCIENTISTS WANT TO CLONE THIS EXTINCT, FROZEN PREHISTORIC HORSE

The team clarified that the mammoth meat is not for consumption, but Vow is currently pushing the idea of cultured meat more generally. The company argues that such meat is more sustainable and environmentally friendly than real meat.

Cultured meat is currently not regulated in the European Union, but Vow hopes to normalize its production and sale in the near future, according to Reuters.

North Carolina's Outer Banks greeted by 13-foot great white shark named 'Breton',"A massive 13-foot, 1,437-pound great white shark was detected off the coast of North Carolina this week as it makes its annual voyage north for the summer months.

Breton, which the marine science non-profit OCEARCH first started tracking in September 2020, pinged near Cape Hatteras in the Outer Banks on Tuesday morning.

The research group has been tracking the shark since tagging it off the coast of Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia two-and-a-half years ago.

Breton was in almost the same exact spot this time last year. The shark made a trip around Bermuda last May, traveled to Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence for last year's summer months, then looped southward to the Bahamas in the fall before traveling up the East Coast again to the Outer Banks.

The adult great white is one of several sharks that OCEARCH is tracking off the coasts of North and South Carolina this month.

Simon, a nearly 9-foot great white, was detected just north of Breton on Tuesday. Georgia, an 8-foot tiger shark, pinged off North Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, while a 12-foot tiger shark named Jax pinged north of Charleston.

As sharks make their journey north toward cooler waters for the summer, they hang out around the continental shelf, a shallow terrace that extends off the coast of the Carolinas about 35 miles.

Researchers from OCEARCH will conduct Expedition Northbound next month, collecting data on the 88 great white sharks that the non-profit has tagged in the western North Atlantic.

"Fed expects a 'mild' recession to begin later this year, meeting minutes show","Recent upheaval within the banking system is likely to drag the U. S. economy into a recession later this year, according to the Federal Reserve.

Minutes from the U. S. central bank's March 21-22 meeting released on Wednesday showed staff members believe a downturn is imminent, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March.

""Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years,"" the minutes said.

HOW THE BANKING CRISIS COULD HAMMER SMALL BUSINESSES

Economic projections laid out following the meeting indicated that economic growth will slow sharply this year and that unemployment will march higher to a rate of 4.5% as rates hikes bring the U. S. to the brink of a recession. The Fed expects the jobless rate to remain elevated in 2024 and 2025 as steeper rates continue to take their toll by pushing up borrowing costs.

Despite concern over a possible recession this year, Fed officials plowed ahead with their campaign to fight inflation. Officials voted at the meeting to raise the benchmark interest rate a quarter percentage point to a range of 4.75% to 5% and signaled that another rate increase is on the table in May, although they noted that future hikes will ultimately hinge on incoming data reports.

Several Fed officials questioned whether to pause the rate hikes and watch to see what happened within the banking system; however, they agreed to vote for another rate increase ""because of elevated inflation, the strength of the recent economic data, and their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.""

Meeting minutes show that officials lowered their expectations for rate hikes this year in the wake of the banking crisis that threatened to more severely tighten credit for U. S. households and amid signs that inflation is beginning to moderate.

""Many participants noted that the likely effects of recent banking-sector developments on economic activity and inflation had led them to lower their assessments of the federal funds rate target range that would be sufficiently restrictive,"" they said.

Still, officials stressed the need to ""retain flexibility and optionality in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy given the highly uncertain economic outlook.""

Inflation showed welcome signs of cooling in March as the cost of gasoline declined, but core prices pointed to strong underlying price pressures that are still bubbling beneath the surface.

The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 0.1% in March from the previous month, down from 0.4% in February. Prices climbed 5% on an annual basis, down sharply from February's 6% increase and the smallest rise in nearly two years.

Economists expect the Fed to approve another quarter-percentage point rate hike in May before hitting pause.

""Headline inflation cooled in March, but it’s not time to celebrate just yet,"" said John Leer, the chief economist at Morning Consult. ""Topline inflation was driven lower primarily by falling energy prices, which tend to be volatile from month to month. Core inflation remains stickier and more persistent than the Fed would like, and combined with the strength of the March jobs report, there's a growing case for the Fed to raise rates yet again at its next meeting.""",2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z
Stefanik to join Jordan for field hearing on New York City’s ‘crime crisis’,"House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik is expected to join the House Judiciary Committee in next week's hearing focused on the crime crisis in New York City, Fox News Digital has learned.

The House Judiciary Committee is holding a field hearing in New York City to ""examine how Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents.""

The hearing, ""Victims of Violent Crime in Manhattan,"" is scheduled for 9 a.m. Monday at the Javits Federal Building.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, asked for Stefanik to join the panel for Monday's hearing.

BODEGA CLERK JOSE ALBA TO TESTIFY AT HOUSE JUDICIARY FIELD HEARING ON VIOLENT CRIME UNDER NYC DA ALVIN BRAGG

Stefanik, who represents New York’s 21st Congressional District, is not a member of the House Judiciary Committee, but Republicans are expected to let her participate in the panel’s highly anticipated hearing in lower Manhattan.

""New York City is the epicenter of the crime crisis,"" Stefanik told Fox News Digital. She blamed ""far-left radical district attorneys like Alvin Bragg"" for ""causing this crime crisis.""

MANHATTAN DA SAYS HOUSE GOP SEEKING TO 'WEAKEN' LAW ENFORCEMENT: 'ABUSE OF POWER'

Stefanik felt strongly about participating in the hearing, saying ""victims need a voice"" and stressing that victims of violent crime come from ""all political backgrounds.""

""New Yorkers fear for their safety,"" Stefanik said, pointing to the ""revolving door of criminals released back into the communities"" who are ""wreaking havoc"" on the city.

""I intend to make sure New Yorkers are represented at this hearing,"" she said.

Jose Alba, a bodega clerk charged with murder after acting in self-defense, will be one of the witnesses at the hearing.

Bragg took over as district attorney in January 2022 from Cyrus Vance. The crime wave has intensified under Bragg's watch.

""He is refusing to go after criminals but is prosecuting Joe Biden’s top opponent,"" Stefanik said of his investigation into former President Trump.

Trump last week pleaded not guilty to 34 felony charges of falsifying business records in New York. The charges, which are related to hush-money payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign, came out of Bragg’s investigation.

Bragg alleged Trump ""repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election.""

Trump has slammed the DA’s investigation and the indictment as ""political persecution and election interference at the highest level in history.""

JORDAN TAKES FIGHT TO ALVIN BRAGG, PLANS NYC HEARING ON HIS ‘PRO-CRIME’ POLICIES

""New Yorkers are smart,"" Stefanik said. ""They want their DA to prosecute violent criminals.""

As for Democrats, Stefanik said, ""They continue to put their heads in the sand.

""Their policies have caused the crime crisis in New York. Republicans stand strongly with police, with law enforcement and with victims.""

Trump was back in New York City Thursday for a deposition before New York State Attorney General Letitia James. James, a Democrat, has been conducting a civil investigation into the Trump Organization since she took office in January 2019.

James brought a lawsuit against Trump in September alleging he and his company misled banks and others about the value of his assets. She also alleged Trump ""inflated his net worth by billions of dollars"" and said his children helped him to do so.

UK scientists find one of largest black holes ever discovered,"Astronomers in the U. K. have discovered one of the largest black holes ever found.

The team, led by Durham University, used gravitational lensing to find the ultramassive black hole.

Gravitational lensing occurs when a celestial object has such a massive gravitational pull that it warps time and space around it, bending the light from a more distant object and magnifying it.

They also used supercomputer simulation on the DiRAC integrated supercomputing facility, enabling researchers to examine how light is bent by a black hole inside a galaxy located hundreds of millions of light-years away.

A university release said that the group simulated light traveling through the universe hundreds of thousands of times, with each simulation including a different mass black hole – changing light’s journey to Earth.

By including an ultramassive black hole in one of their simulations, they found that the path taken from the light from the galaxy to reach Earth matched one seen in real images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.

They found an ultramassive black hole in the foreground galaxy – an object that is more than 30 billion times the mass of the sun.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE 'NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED'

Durham University said this is the first black hole found using gravitational lensing. Durham University astronomer Professor Alastair Edge first noticed a giant arc of a gravitational lens when reviewing images of a galaxy survey in 2004.

""Most of the biggest black holes that we know about are in an active state, where matter pulled in close to the black hole heats up and releases energy in the form of light, X-rays, and other radiation,"" Lead author Dr. James Nightingale said in a statement.

""However, gravitational lensing makes it possible to study inactive black holes, something not currently possible in distant galaxies. This approach could let us detect many more black holes beyond our local universe and reveal how these exotic objects evolved further back in cosmic time,"" the physics department professor said.

"Walmart closing 4 Chicago stores, blaming millions in annual losses","Walmart has announced Tuesday that it is closing four of its Chicago stores because they are part of a group of locations that ""lose tens of millions of dollars a year.""

The retail giant says the Chatham Supercenter, the Walmart Health center, and the Walmart Academy at 8431 S. Stewart Ave., the Kenwood Neighborhood Market at 4720 S. Cottage Grove Ave., the Lakeview Neighborhood Market at 2844 N. Broadway St. and the Little Village Neighborhood Market at 2551 W. Cermak Road will shutter this upcoming Sunday.

""The simplest explanation is that collectively our Chicago stores have not been profitable since we opened the first one nearly 17 years ago -- these stores lose tens of millions of dollars a year, and their annual losses nearly doubled in just the last five years,"" Walmart said in a statement.

""The remaining four Chicago stores continue to face the same business difficulties, but we think this decision gives us the best chance to help keep them open and serving the community,"" it added.

Walmart said that ""over the years, we have tried many different strategies to improve the business performance of these locations, including building smaller stores, localizing product assortment and offering services beyond traditional retail.

""We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the city, including $70 million in the last couple years to upgrade our stores and build two new Walmart Health facilities and a Walmart Academy training center,"" the company also said.

""It was hoped that these investments would help improve our stores’ performance,"" Walmart said in press release, but ""Unfortunately, these efforts have not materially improved the fundamental business challenges our stores are facing.""

Those employed by the stores that are soon set to close are now eligible to transfer to work at other Walmart locations.

""Hiring managers from surrounding facilities will be in each of these stores this week to help associates begin finding their next opportunity,"" according to Walmart.

The company said it hopes to repurpose the buildings it’s leaving behind so they remain ""important parts of their communities.""

Affected staff will be paid until Aug. 11, 2023, unless they transfer out to another store.

After that date, Walmart said those eligible will receive severance benefits.

Water found in moon samples from China mission,"Scientists have discovered a new and renewable source of water on the moon in samples from a Chinese lunar mission.

Water was found in tiny glass beads in the lunar dirt where violent meteorite impacts occur. The beads are the width of just hairs, and the water was a small fraction of that.

The samples were returned from the moon in 2020, including 32 glass beads that were randomly picked from lunar dirt from the robotic Chang'e-5 mission.

Mining the water would be tricky, because there are billions to trillions of beads, according to researchers.

""Yes, it will require lots and lots of glass beads,"" Hejiu Hui of Nanjing University, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press. ""On the other hand, there are lots and lots of beads on the moon.""

The beads could continue to yield water due to continuous streams of hydrogen in solar wind. Solar wind is a stream of charged particles that emanate from the outermost part of the star's atmosphere.

""Solar wind-derived water is produced by the reaction of solar hydrogen with oxygen present at the surface of the lunar glass beads,"" Sen Hu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geology and Geophysics, a co-author of the study, told Reuters.

Hui said that more samples will be studied in the future and more work is necessary to determine whether water could be extracted by heating the beads.

In addition, the scientists need to do more studies to find out whether the water would be safe to drink.

"Ohio doctor acquitted of 14 patient deaths sues healthcare system, seeks $20M","An Ohio doctor acquitted in the deaths of 14 patients who died after they were given painkillers has filed a lawsuit against a national Catholic health system that operates the hospital where he worked in the intensive care unit.

William Husel claims malicious prosecution and names Trinity Health Corp. in a complaint filed Wednesday in federal court in Detroit. He is seeking a jury trial and at least $20 million in damages.

Husel was accused of ordering painkillers for patients in the Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl.

OHIO DR. WILLIAM HUSEL ACQUITTED ON ALL CHARGES ALLEGING HE MURDERED 14 PATIENTS WITH EXCESSIVE PAINKILLER USE

Prosecutors in that case had said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them.

A jury found Husel not guilty of 14 counts of murder in April 2022.

Husel was fired in late 2018 from Mount Carmel West Hospital, a member of Trinity Health. He later was indicted on 25 murder counts. Eleven of those counts were dismissed by county prosecutors in January 2022.

Husel ""voluntary relinquished his license to practice medicine,"" according to the federal lawsuit.

""Dr. Husel understood that, notwithstanding the acquittal, the reputation damage he endured would prevent him from ever working as a doctor,"" the complaint said.

A separate defamation lawsuit against Trinity is awaiting trial in Ohio’s Franklin County, according to Husel’s attorney, Robert Landy of the New York-based Ford O’Brien Landy law firm.

OHIO JURY DEADLOCKED IN TRIAL OF DOCTOR ACCUSED OF KILLING PATIENTS BY OVERPRESCRIBING FENTANYL

That lawsuit was filed while Husel was under indictment. The damages sought by Husel in the malicious prosecution lawsuit are in case he does not recover the amount in the defamation case, Landy said.

""A malicious prosecution case says that a person complains to the authorities for the purpose of getting you arrested and indicted, as opposed to good faith belief that you’ve done something wrong,"" Landy said. ""It only works if the defendant is acquitted.""

Trinity Health said through a spokeswoman Thursday that the allegations in the lawsuit ""are unfounded.""

Mötley Crüe manager says Mick Mars is a victim of 'elder abuse' amid touring dispute,"Mötley Crüe's manager claimed Mick Mars' representatives are ""taking advantage"" of the guitarist amid the group's recent touring dispute.

In court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, Mick Mars accused the band of forcing him to resign after he chose to stop touring. However, the band's manager Allen Kovac and a lawyer for the band claimed representatives for Mars, including the guitarist's lawyer, ""manipulated"" him into the dispute.

Kovac, who has managed the heavy metal band for the past 29 years, told Fox News Digital, ""Every time there was a problem, [Mick] would call me. I haven't heard from Mick. I would have protected him from the elderly abuse that [the representatives] are taking advantage of him with.""

A representative for Mars had no comment regarding the ""elder abuse"" allegation.

Mars filed a mandate of writ on April 6 claiming Mötley Crüe had been slow to turn over documents, but Mötley Crüe's lawyer Sasha Frid of Miller Barondess told Fox News Digital there is ""no issue"" regarding documents.

""We're an open book. We're not hiding any documents from this guy,"" Frid claimed. ""There's no issue with documents. You want your documents, here are your documents.""

The mandate of writ was filed ahead of the band and Mars going to arbitration over a shareholders agreement amendment signed in 2008. At the time, all original members of the band – Vince Neil, Tommy Lee, Nikki Six and Mick Mars – signed an agreement stating they would not be entitled to any touring revenue or any value of the Mötley Crüe name once they had resigned from the band, according to Frid.

""It's common sense,"" Frid explained. ""If you're not out on the road touring, you don't get any money from touring. Just like when I don't go to work, I don't get a paycheck.""

Mötley Crüe previously claimed that when Mars announced that he couldn't tour anymore, he was resigning from the band. However, in court documents Mars alleges that he told the band members that he could still play in a residency situation and could still record.

The guitarist just could no longer ""physically handle the rigor of the roads.""

""It is beyond sad that, after 41 years together, a band would try to throw out a member who is unable to tour anymore because he has a debilitating disease,"" Mars' attorney Ed McPherson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Mick has been pushed around for far too long in this band, and we are not going to let that continue.""

Meanwhile, lawyers for Mötley Crüe maintain that Mars gave up his rights to any future earnings from tours after he quit.

The back-and-forth between Mars and Mötley Crüe began in October. Fans became confused due to differing statements. Mars announced that he was retiring from touring due to his arthritis, while the band claimed that he was retiring from music completely.

I don’t really know if I should say this, but… those guys have been hammering on me since ’87, trying to replace me,"" Mars told Variety. ""They haven’t been able to do that, because I’m the guitar player. I helped form this band. It’s my name I came up with [the Mötley Crüe moniker], my ideas, my money that I had from a backer to start this band. It wouldn’t have gone anywhere.""

Frid and Kovac claim that after Mars announced he was retiring from touring, the guitarist was offered a ""generous compensation package"" despite being entitled to nothing due to the 2008 amendment.

""Despite the fact that the band did not owe Mick anything – and with Mick owing the band millions in advances that he did not pay back – the band offered Mick a generous compensation package to honor his career with the band,"" Frid explained to Fox News Digital. ""Manipulated by his manager and lawyer, Mick refused and chose to file this ugly public lawsuit.""

The ""generous compensation package"" included 7.5% of the remaining tour revenue, according to Kovac. However, Mars and McPherson claimed the musician was entitled to 25% of all touring for the history of the band in perpetuity.

Frid claimed there was no reason to file the writ of mandate, and says the documents requested by Mars could have been recovered through arbitration.

""If this lawsuit was really about documents, then Mick and his lawyer would not have spilled ink recanting a 41-year band history and badmouthing the band’s performance on tours,"" the lawyer said.

""Mick and his lawyer filed this lawsuit to make derogatory statements so that they can be protected from a defamation lawsuit under California’s litigation privilege,"" he claimed. ""This lawsuit is nothing more than a malicious attempt to smear the band and Mick’s former bandmates to gain leverage – orchestrated by Mick’s lawyer.""

In Mars' lawsuit, he also claimed other members of the band were not actually playing while on stage. Specifically, he claimed Nikki Six's parts were all pre-recorded and some of Neil and Lee's were as well.

However, the band obtained signed declarations from crew members, who Kovac claimed are ""independent contractors,"" on Feb. 9 stating that Mars was actually the band member not playing live. Mötley Crüe chose not to publicize these declarations until Mars' lawsuit.

Mars' lawyer claimed the declarations came from ""employees"" of the band.

Few heavy metal acts were as notorious in the 1980s – onstage and off – as Mötley Crüe, whose songs include ""Looks That Kill,"" ""Shout at the Devil"" and ""Girls, Girls, Girls."" Fueled by drugs and booze, their stage show included excessive amounts of pyrotechnics and chain-sawing the head off a mannequin filled with blood.

Mötley Crüe was formed in 1981 by Sixx and Tommy Lee. The two were later joined by Mars and Vince Neil.

Commercial real estate industry on edge as downtown empty office space goes unused,"Some Morgan Stanley financial analysts say the commercial real estate industry could be headed for a crisis worse than the 2008 great recession. This comes after businesses have left downtowns across the country with an increase in remote work and higher interest rates.

Many downtown buildings are owned by investment firms who rely on bank loans. But with businesses not renting as much office space and rising interest rates, some worry these firms may not have the money to pay back the banks.

In downtown Minneapolis, people are returning to see the Minnesota Twins play ball, attend a concert or catch a Broadway show.

""As we sit here today, we're really beginning to move in a positive direction,"" Steve Cramer, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council and Downtown Improvement District, said. ""Like all downtowns, that pandemic hit like a ton of bricks and things really shut down. Then we of course, had the murder of George Floyd here in our city and that caused civil unrest here, and had implications around the country, around the globe. And so we've really been kind of working our way back from that set of events in 2020.""

Cramer worries about the office buildings that are 30 to 40 years old.

""We have to focus some attention on what can a new life for those buildings be? Maybe they can be converted into residential units,"" Cramer said. ""The newer buildings with amenities, I think are going to do just fine in attracting the office demand.""

Last week AT & T announced it was leaving downtown Minneapolis for the suburbs.

""The move will be complete by the end of August, allowing us to use our office space more effectively. It’s important to note that these jobs will remain in the greater Minneapolis area, and we remain committed to Minnesota,"" Clay Owens, director of public relations for AT&T, said.

Andy Babula is the Director of the Real Estate Program and the Shenehon Center for Real Estate at the University of St. Thomas.

""People are working from home a lot more now. If they do want to go into the office, they're going to want somewhere nearby,"" Babula said about the decision to move to the suburbs where many employees tend to live.

According to CBRE Global Commercial Real Estate Services, in New York City there has been a 7.6% increase in empty office space since the pandemic. In Seattle, an 8.2% increase and in San Francisco, a whopping 25.4% increase.

CBRE says that San Francisco has a large amount of tech tenants, and they have viewed returning to work in person differently. Many employees are asked to come back to work on a more voluntary basis, which explains why they saw such a sharp increase in empty office space in comparison to other cities.

In Minneapolis, there’s only been a 2.1% increase in empty space, but some worry the problem could get worse.

""If the pandemic started three years ago, people may still have a few years left on their lease. So, over the next couple of years, we are going to be seeing these leases expire and companies as they expire will likely either vacate or downsize,"" Babula said.

Babula also said there is concern that the value of the buildings will decrease and impact the tax base.

US REAL ESTATE HAS ‘MONUMENTAL OPPORTUNITY’ TO SOLVE HOUSING CRISIS IN 2023: EXPERT

""The city like Minneapolis is going to collect less taxes from every building downtown if its value is lower by 20 to 30%. That's less taxes in their pocket, and that has to then get shifted to others in the city, to the residents and other businesses throughout the city. So that's a concern as well,"" Babula said.

With less demand for office space, investment firms who own these downtown buildings may not have enough money to pay off their loans to the banks.

""Do we believe that we're going to see defaults? Absolutely. Are we keeping a close eye on the banks that hold a lot of these loans? Absolutely, but generally we believe that we are going to be able to come through the other end of this with some scratches and bruises, but nothing that is going to drive the collapse of the banking system,"" Julie Whelan, head of global head of occupier thought leadership at CBRE, said.

Whelan said downtowns are not dying by any means, they're just going through an evolution right now. Many are shifting towards a footprint of more residential, retail and entertainment to make up for the office crowds leaving.

""If the different sides of the private sector and the public sector can come together and create an impetus drive to change in our cities that we’ll actually come out feeling stronger when we look ahead 10 years from now,"" Whelan said.",2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z

Banking crisis could cement hard landing,"The economist known as ""Dr. Doom"" is warning that the recent banking crisis could undermine the Fed’s efforts to engineer a soft landing without a recession as it tries to tamp down inflation.

Nouriel Roubini, the CEO of Roubini Macro Associates and an economics professor at New York University, appeared Monday on FOX Business’ ""The Claman Countdown"" and told host Liz Claman that the U. S. banking system — particularly regional banks — will struggle in the near term. Claman asked if First Republic Bank’s recent announcement that it would suspend its quarterly dividend on preferred stock indicates U.S. banks and global financials have a long, dark road ahead.

""It tells me that not just for First Republic, but also for many other regional banks, their business model is severely challenged right now,"" Roubini responded. ""They have a narrow deposit base, they have a large amount of uninsured deposits, and now people are realizing that they can earn, say 4 or 5% on money market T-bills that are insured by the government when they get close to zero on their deposits. So that’s the source of their fundamental problem, and therefore the banking problems are going to continue for the regional banks.""

SILICON VALLEY BANK: WHAT WE LEARNED, WHAT’S NEXT AFTER THE COLLAPSE

The failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which was the 17th largest bank in the U. S. at the time of its collapse, occurred because it had a significant amount of uninsured deposits — over 93% of total deposits per S&P Global — and was overexposed to long-term Treasury securities that lost value as the Fed increased interest rates to reduce inflation. It also had a deposit base that was concentrated in venture capital-backed companies and tech startups that tend to have large cash balances and less recurring revenue.

Signature Bank failed shortly after Silicon Valley Bank and had about 89% of its total deposits uninsured. The New York-based regional bank catered to cryptocurrency firms.

First Republic Bank, which has so far avoided a collapse but has seen its stock price decline by over 80% since the crisis began, had about 67% of its total deposit base uninsured as of the end of last year per S&P Global.

IS MY BANK SAFE FROM FAILING? WARNING SIGNS OF FINANCIAL TROUBLE

""I think the problems are with the regionals, but the regional banks are significant lenders to households for mortgages, for small businesses, for SMEs, for commercial real estate. And therefore we’re going to have a credit crunch,"" Roubini explained.

He added, ""That credit crunch is going to make the likelihood of a recession, a hard landing, much greater than before. So we’re facing a serious credit crunch for a good chunk of the U. S. banking system.""

Claman asked Roubini what signs he’s looking for that would indicate ""the market has bottomed and you will then go from Dr. Doom to Dr. Boom"" to which Roubini responded:

""Well, the worst is ahead of us because the Fed and other central banks are facing a dilemma. They have to reach price stability. They have to maintain economic growth and avoid a recession. And they have to maintain financial stability. Interest rates have to rise further because inflation is still well above target. That’s going to cause a hard landing of the economy.""

He went on to say that ""we’re waiting until we get this crash, until we get something more severe. We’re not going to be at the bottom for a while.""

The Federal Reserve is expected to hike the benchmark federal funds rate by another 25 basis points next month, but uncertainty around whether inflation will ease further is clouding expectations about whether there will be further rate hikes or potential rate cuts later this year. Claman asked Roubini whether the expected 25 basis point rate hike could cause a market accident.

""Well, with 25 basis points, no. But the problem is the markets are now expecting that the Fed is going to aggressively cut rates in that second half of the year,"" Roubini replied. ""And I think that the Fed cannot even do only 25 basis points. Inflation is high enough that it may be all the way for fed funds rates of 6% still on hold for a year before cutting interest rates. So the markets are a bit delusional and that’s where an accident can occur.""",2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z
"Hunter Biden firm sought Irish government investments while Biden was VP, raising questions about Ireland trip","FIRST ON FOX: President Biden’s embattled son was invited to accompany his dad and aunt to Ireland this week, despite continued scrutiny over the Biden family’s foreign business dealings and dual investigations.

In 2011, Hunter's partners at his now-defunct investment firm Rosemont Seneca Partners discussed making contacts to expand their energy investments in various state-owned investment funds, including in China, Ireland, Oman and Qatar, according to emails reviewed by Fox News Digital.

On March 8, 2011, Eric Schwerin, the firm’s former president, sent Hunter and then-CEO Devon Archer an email containing the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute’s (SWFI) current list of the top sovereign wealth fund, which are state owned, and their rankings at the time.

""Let's discuss today what else we can be doing to connect with these groups,"" Archer responded, adding that Rosemont Seneca was ""already working"" with several funds on the list, including two in China.

BIDEN'S CLAIM TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS IS BECOMING HARDER TO MAINTAIN

""China Social Security-following up with Jonathan Li to see if there's viability,"" Archer wrote to Schwerin and Hunter, referring to the National Social Security Fund in China, which had over $146 billion in assets at the time, according to the SWFI list, and Hunter’s Chinese business partner, Li, whom Biden briefly met in China more than 2 years later.

In December 2013, then-Vice President Biden traveled to Beijing due to a scheduled meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Hunter expressed interest in joining his father on the trip and ended up going, where he admitted to the New Yorker that he introduced his father to Li, who ran the Chinese private-equity fund Bohai Capital.

According to the report, Hunter arranged for a brief handshake in the lobby of the hotel where the U. S. delegation was staying and then Hunter met up with Li privately.

Archer’s March 2011 email to Hunter and Schwerin added he was scheduling a meeting for that April with the China Investment Corporation, China’s largest sovereign wealth fund that manages part of the government’s foreign exchange reserves.

The SWFI list said CIC had over $332 billion in assets at the time of Archer’s email.

Another sovereign wealth fund mentioned on the SWFI list was the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) in Ireland, which had $33 billion in assets at the time. The NPRF was a public pension fund that later became the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) in 2014, according to Investopedia.

Archer suggested that someone from Rosemont Seneca reach out to Dan Rooney, the then-U. S. ambassador to Ireland, who was appointed by Obama in 2009, in order to gain connections to the Irish government.

""Ideas we could follow-up on,"" Archer wrote. ""Ireland- ask for intro through Rooney.""

VP BIDEN'S OFFICE TRIED TO QUASH BLOOMBERG STORY ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN AT HIS FIRM'S REQUEST, EMAILS SHOW

Schwerin then suggested to Devon and Hunter that an informal meeting with Rooney could be arranged during the St. Patrick's Day festivities in Washington, D. C., the following week.

""Ireland - I assume there may be some opportunities to informally connect to Rooney, et. al. at the St. Patrick's Day stuff next week and then formally follow up afterwards?""

Archer then joked that they should use a mashup video of comments by Tom Cruise and Charlie Sheen as their ""pitch.""

""We should use this in our pitch,"" he said, linking to the video.

Fox News Digital asked the White House whether it was aware of the 2011 email before the Ireland trip, or whether it could guarantee Hunter would not use the trip to further his financial interests, but it declined to respond.

It is unclear whether Hunter and his now-defunct firm were successful with any potential business ventures in Ireland. Rooney passed away in 2017.

News of the email comes as Biden travels Ireland with Hunter, and his sister and former campaign manager, Valerie Biden Owens, on his first presidential trip to Ireland to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.

The Bidens boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Tuesday and headed for the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast for a four-day tour of the country in an effort to ""keep the peace"" in the region.

Biden was asked by reporters on the tarmac whether any family members were accompanying him on the trip, but he didn't give names.

"AOC, other pro-choicers want to ignore court ruling blocking abortion pill","Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a heroine on the Left, does not like the ruling by a Texas judge directing the FDA to stop the approval of an abortion pill that was greenlit by the agency more than two decades ago.

Her solution: simply ignore it. Those are her words.

Now there are serious questions to be raised about the order by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee and opponent of abortion who would freeze the approval of mifepristone while a lawsuit challenging its safety winds its way through the courts. The Biden Justice Department has appealed.

How can a drug that’s been safely used by many Americans since 2000 suddenly be deemed unsafe? Wouldn’t that destroy the ability of the FDA or any other regulatory agency to make well-grounded decisions?

TRUMP DEFIES JUDGE WITH NEW ROUND OF STINGING ATTACKS ON PROSECUTORS

But the idea that politicians can choose to blow off court rulings they don’t like is just as dangerous, since it would – not to overstate things here – totally undermine the rule of law.

""That’s a pretty stunning position,"" CNN host Dana Bash told the New York congresswoman when she made the remarks Sunday.

AOC is hardly the only Democrat slamming the Texas decision. In fact, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, in his own CNN sitdown, would not rule out ignoring the court order, saying ""everything is on that table."" And Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, told CNN’s morning show yesterday that she agrees with taking no action on the ruling.

The South Carolina lawmaker, clearly worried about the fallout from taking too hard a line on restricting abortion, said: ""This is an issue that Republicans have largely been on the wrong side of. We have, over the last nine months, not shown compassion towards women.""

Regardless of your views on abortion, we have a judicial system that has worked pretty well since Marbury v. Madison. If you don’t like a court ruling, try to get it overturned, countersue or work to elect politicians who would name judges that share your values. I don’t see how ""ignore it"" is a viable option.

AOC argued in the interview that she does ""not believe that the courts have the authority over the FDA that they just asserted, and I do believe that it creates a crisis.""

Ocasio-Cortez insisted there was ample ""precedent"" for the executive branch to shrug off lower-court rulings, saying Donald Trump had done that very thing on lower court orders to fully restore DACA, the law protecting the dreamers that he was moving to abolish. The Supreme Court in 2020 blocked Trump’s plan on a 5-4 vote. But in that case the issue was resolved by the courts.

Even if Trump had engaged in slow-walking during the court fight, how does it help AOC’s case to say, well, the other side does it too? Such logic would lead to both parties feeling emboldened to ignore unfavorable court rulings.

AS EXPECTED, TRUMP INDICTMENT ALL ABOUT FALSIFYING RECORDS – FOR HUSH MONEY

At the same time, an Obama judge in Washington state ruled in favor of preserving the status quo for medicated abortions in the 17 states where it is now legal. So now we have dueling rulings, and this is clearly headed for the highest court.

Which brings up another point: why should a federal district judge be able to issue a nationwide injunction? Shouldn’t the authority be limited to that district? That only encourages forum-shopping. If you file a case in Amarillo, you get Kacsmaryk, because he’s the only federal judge there. AOC complained about ""deeply partisan"" judges and said the courts are ""now going rogue."" Are there no partisan judges on the other side, such as when SCOTUS was issuing liberal rulings on abortion and civil rights a half century ago? What about when the John Roberts court, in 2015, legalized same-sex marriage?

The stakes are extremely high. For decades, getting an abortion meant going to a clinic, perhaps encountering protesters, even as conservative states passed restrictive new laws. Now the availability of mifepristone means universal access, although there are legal battles to come over whether the pills can be mailed across state lines or within states banning abortion in the post-Roe era.

"Mary Quant, designer who revolutionized 1960s fashion, dies at age 93","Mary Quant, the visionary fashion designer whose colorful, sexy miniskirts epitomized Swinging London in the 1960s and influenced youth culture around the world, has died. She was 93.

Quant’s family said she died ""peacefully at home"" in Surrey, southern England, on Thursday.

Quant helped popularize the miniskirt — some credit her with inventing it — and the innovative tights that went along with it, creating dresses and accessories that were an integral part of the look. She created mix-and-match, simple garments that had an element of whimsy. Some compared her impact on the fashion world with The Beatles’ impact on pop music.

""I think it was a happy confluence of events, which is really what fashion is so often all about,"" said Hamish Bowles, international editor at large for American Vogue magazine. ""She was the right person with the right sensibility in the right place at the right time. She appeared on the scene at the exact cusp of the ’60s.""

GILBERT GOTTFRIED: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE LATE ‘ALADDIN’ STAR AND COMEDIAN

He said Quant was also an astute businesswoman and one of the first to understand how branding herself as a creative force could help her sustain her business and branch out into new fields, like cosmetics.

Alexandra Shulman, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, wrote on Twitter: ""RIP Dame Mary Quant. A leader of fashion but also in female entrepreneurship- a visionary who was much more than a great haircut.""

Quant was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the ""youthquake"" that took hold in the 1960s. She sensed that the days of the exclusive salons were numbered, and thought that even the great Parisian designers would follow ready-to-wear trends.

The look she created was sexy and fun, a sharp break with the predictable floral day dresses commonly worn in the conservative, austere years after World War II.

Quant introduced miniskirts with hemlines up to 8 inches above the knee to the London scene in 1966 and they were an instant hit with young people, in part because they shocked and offended many.

While some insist she first developed the style, many also credit French designer Andre Courreges, whose 1964 spring collection included minidresses that were popular in Paris but did not have widespread impact outside France. Others cite the short skirts worn by actress Anne Francis in the 1956 film ""Forbidden Planet"" as the first example of the miniskirt.

Whether or not she was the first to design them, it was Quant who figured out how to market the miniskirt to the masses.

Quant, who named the skirt after her favorite make of car, the Mini, recalled how it offered a ""feeling of freedom and liberation.″ From her shop on King’s Road in London's trendy Chelsea neighborhood, she took part in a clothing revolution.

""It was the girls on King’s Road who invented the mini. I was making clothes which would let you run and dance and we would make them the length the customer wanted,″ she said. ""I wore them very short and the customers would say, ‘shorter, shorter’.""

While Courreges came from an haute couture tradition and his clothes were expensive items aimed at a limited audience, Quant used a variety of materials and colors to make miniskirts popular with young women on a limited budget.

""She blasted through barriers of snobbery and tradition, with her vision of fashion as a way of resisting stereotypes, with well-made clothes and cosmetics that were empowering and liberating, as well as affordable,"" said Jenny Lister, who curated a 2020 exhibition devoted to Quant at London’s Victoria & Albert Museum.

""Fashion today owes so much to the revolutionary, trailblazing Mary Quant.""""

She shot to the top of the fashion scene at the time when The Beatles and Rolling Stones dominated the music world, and she was forever linked to the heady freedoms of the 1960s.

The clothes became wildly popular and were worn by models like Twiggy and Pattie Boyd, who was then married to Beatles guitarist George Harrison.

Asked by the Guardian newspaper in 1967 if her clothes could be considered ""vulgar"" because they were so revealing, Quant replied that she loved vulgarity and embraced it.

""Good taste is death, vulgarity is life,"" she said, adding that the provocative poses of her models reflected the new sexual openness of the times, which was fueled by the development of the birth control pill.

Born Feb. 11, 1930, the daughter of schoolteachers, Quant studied art education at Goldsmith’s College in London before moving into fashion, working first as an apprentice to a hat-maker before trying her own designs.

With the help of her wealthy husband and business partner, Alexander Plunket Greene, and the accountant Archie McNair, she opened Bazaar in Chelsea in 1955, at first relying on innovative window displays to bring in younger customers.

""Snobbery has gone out of fashion, and in our shops you will find duchesses jostling with typists to buy the same dress,"" Quant once said. She called the store ""a sophisticated candy store for grown-ups.""

Bazaar became a focal point for the young and the beautiful and those who wanted to rub shoulders with them, and her presence there helped make the neighborhood a favored destination. Small restaurants, bistros and pubs all flourished and other boutiques opened, giving Chelsea’s King’s Road the feel of a perpetual party.

The shop was such a success that she soon moved into other parts of London and began exporting her clothes to the United States, where the ""British invasion"" was in full swing.

Quant was unusual in that she often modeled her own clothes, usually with her hair styled in a distinctive, angular bob by hairdresser Vidal Sassoon.

She soon diversified her interests, developing a popular makeup line and also moving into kitchenware and household accessories.

The makeup proved extremely profitable, particularly in Japan, where Quant retained a devoted following.

Quant was also credited with introducing hot pants and micro-minis to the fashion scene in the late 1960s.

She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for service to the fashion industry in 1966, wearing a trademark miniskirt when she received the honor at Buckingham Palace. In 2014, she was made a dame — the female equivalent of a knight — for services to British fashion. At the start of this year she was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honor, a royal honor restricted to 65 people ""of distinction"" in the arts, science, medicine or government

Quant stepped down from the day-to-day management of her firm, Mary Quant Ltd., in 2000 after it was purchased by a Japanese company, but kept working as a consultant.

The firm continued to use the daisy motif and logo that Quant pioneered in the 1960s, and it long maintained a shop in London, in addition to roughly 200 shops in Japan.",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
Biden's transparency criticized by Americans,"People in Nashville weighed in on President Biden’s growing rift with the White House press corps and his administration’s transparency since taking office.

""He doesn't answer any questions,"" one man, David, told Fox News. ""I honestly just don't think he's in charge of the country.""

Kerry, however, said, ""I think we still get all the information we need to. Maybe he just isn't looking for the spotlight as much as others may have.""

The White House press corps grew frustrated with the president after hearing he would forgo a formal news conference during his four-day trip to Ireland this week. Biden has done only 23 press conferences since taking office, compared to 41 by President Trump, 53 by President Obama and 45 by President Bush at this point in their administrations.

Another man, Robert, said, ""Nobody really knows what's going on anymore.""

""The press corps travels with him, right?"" David said. ""I think all the media sources are getting frustrated, because they can't report on anything.""

The reporters pushed back on Biden’s lack of transparency in a Monday press conference, with one reporter asking whether the administration was ""trying to protect the president"" from their questions.

REPORTERS ERUPT ON JEAN-PIERRE OVER BIDEN NOT TAKING QUESTIONS FROM PRESS POOL: ‘THAT’S NOT TRUE'

""Certainly the president, many times, has stood in front of all of you, has taken questions on his own because he wanted to see what was on your minds. . . . That has happened multiple times, many times, during this administration. And that will certainly continue to be. When it comes to a formal press conference, I don't have anything to share with you at this time,"" she said.

Michael, visiting Nashville from Connecticut, said the press secretary’s response was ""laughable.""

""They won't let him talk to anybody – do any interviews. Donald Trump answered so many questions. Biden won't answer anything,"" he said.

""I think we all know that he doesn't run the show,"" another man, Matt, said. ""His handlers pretty much take care of everything that he does.""

""Obviously, he seems compromised to some degree,"" Pete said. ""So yeah, I think they would try to minimize that.""

Biden avoided press questions during his trip to Ukraine and Poland in February, though he held a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a trip to Ottawa in March.

Despite his cold shoulder to reporters, Biden did field questions from elementary school-age children of U. S. Embassy staffers after arriving in Dublin Wednesday.

""He doesn't want to talk about his son. He doesn't want to talk about Ukraine. He doesn't want to talk about inflation,"" Michael said. ""He doesn't want to talk about what's really hurting America.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
IMF trims global growth outlook as banking turmoil raises risk of hard landing,"The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global growth outlook for the year, warning the world economy faces the increased risk of a ""hard landing"" due to continued fallout from a spate of bank failures, higher interest rates and stubborn inflation.

The Washington-based institution said in its latest World Economic Outlook that global gross domestic product will grow by just 2.8% this year – which represents a 0.1 percentage point decline from its previous forecast in January – before rising to 3% in 2024.

""The major forces that affected the world in 2022… seem likely to continue into 2023,"" the report said. ""But these forces are now overlaid by and interacting with new financial stability concerns. A hard landing – particularly for advanced economies – has become a much larger risk. Policymakers may face difficult trade-offs to bring sticky inflation down and maintain growth while also preserving financial stability.""

The contrast is even sharper in developed nations, which are struggling to absorb the effects of tighter monetary policy after a decade of ultra-low interest rates. About 90% of advanced economies are expected to see a decline in GDP this year, with the IMF projecting meager growth of just 1.3% in 2023 and 1.4% next year.

The U. S. economy is likely to grow just 1.6% this year and 1.1% next year, according to the IMF, a slight improvement from the January projections.

""A return of the world economy to the pace of economic growth that prevailed before the bevy of shocks in 2022 and the recent financial sector turmoil is increasingly elusive,"" the repot said. ""More than a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of more contagious COVID-19 variants, many economies are still absorbing the shocks. The recent tightening in global financial conditions is also hampering the recovery.""

HOW THE BANKING CRISIS COULD HAMMER SMALL BUSINESSES

With central banks driving up interest rates in order to fight inflation, the road to economic recovery seems more elusive than ever. Over the medium term, the prospects for global growth seem ""dimmer than in decades.""

Although inflation has been steadily declining since mid-2022 in the face of tighter monetary policy, price pressures remain elevated, leaving household budgets strained. The IMF projected that global headline inflation will decline from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% in 2023 – double what the institution estimated just one year ago.

Returning inflation to target levels is expected to take until 2025 in most cases.

Sticky inflation could force central banks to continue hiking interest rates, despite the bleak outlook and recent financial system upheaval in the U. S., Switzerland and Germany.

The problems in the financial sector began with the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank in early March. Rising interest rates sent the value of dated, long-term securities tumbling, and a sudden rush of customer withdrawals forced them to sell those assets at a loss. Regulators seized SVB on March 10 and took control of Signature Bank – which was besieged by similar problems – two days later.

Within days, U. S. authorities took extraordinary steps to contain the fallout from the banks' failures and shore up wavering confidence in the financial system, including protecting all deposits at the two institutions – even those accounts that exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 insurance limit.",2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z

‘Wheel of Fortune’ fans rally around unlucky contestant who ‘fainted’ during game show,"After an unlucky ""Wheel of Fortune"" player ""fainted"" on the game show, fans continued to cheer on the contestant.

On the game show’s social media accounts, video clips were shared of player Justin spinning the wheel of misfortune as he landed on the Bankrupt wedge several times.

""Come on wheel,"" Justin announced positively before he landed on the Bankrupt wedge twice.

'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' FANS RAGE AFTER HOST PAT SAJAK 'ROBBED' CONTESTANT OF $100K PRIZE

""Ah, man,"" he shouted after the second failed attempt to win some prize money.

Although the saying goes, ""third time’s the charm,"" it wasn’t for Justin.

The ""Wheel of Fortune"" recap showed Justin’s third spin landed on a ""Lose a Turn"" wedge.

‘WHEEL OF FORTUNE' HOST PAT SAJAK TACKLES CONTESTANT IN BIZARRE MOMENT THAT HAS FANS PUZZLED

Justin, unfortunately, landed on yet another Bankrupt wedge afterward, and during his final spin, the video showed Justin landing on – you guessed it, another Bankrupt wedge.

This caused Justin to jokingly faint behind the game show podium as luck didn't appear to be on his side.

""We’re going to ask you, and we love your acting, but now if you just spin it one more time, we won’t accept a Bankrupt, go ahead,"" longtime host Pat Sajak suggested.

Once Justin’s spin landed on another ""Lose a Turn"" wedge, Sajak shouted, ""Get ready to fall again, Justin, go!""

""You want to try it again?"" Sajak asked.

Once he responded ""Yeah,"" Justin finally landed on a $650 wedge.

After his abundance of unlucky spins, fans were quick to cheer the ""Wheel of Fortune"" player on.

""He went home with $2000 – that’s more than I made today. And he had a lot of fun! This could be the beginning of big things for Justin. He’s definitely a fan favorite,"" one comment on the show's Instagram read.

Drake Bell is 'safe' after former Nickelodeon star was reported ‘missing and endangered’,"Former Nickelodeon actor Drake Bell, is no longer missing, the Daytona Beach Police department has confirmed.

The actor, 36, was previously labeled as ""missing and endangered"" by police.

""At this time we can confirm law enforcement officials are in contact and Mr. Bell is safe,"" a police spokesperson told Fox 35 News.

In a missing person's post on its official Facebook page, the Daytona Beach Police Department reported earlier this morning that Bell, whose real name is Jared, was last seen driving his 2022 gray BMW in the area of Mainland High School before 9 p.m. Wednesday.

A representative for Bell's attorney told Fox News Digital at the time he has ""no comment at this time.""

Included in the post was a photograph of Bell wearing black framed glasses and a baseball cap.

The department left an additional comment on the post saying, ""For those asking, this is a legitimate post from the Daytona Beach Police Department.""

Bell has faced a litany of run-ins with the law, including an arrest for driving under the influence in 2016, and most recently pleading guilty to two charges involving a minor in Ohio in 2021. The child star was charged with one count of felony attempted child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles.

Bell was sentenced to two years' probation, as well as 200 hours of community service in California. Additionally, he cannot have any communication with the victim.

After probation, the judge said Bell's sex offender status would be reviewed.

Fox 8 reported Bell allegedly engaged in an inappropriate chat with a victim that ""at times, was sexual in nature.""

After pleading guilty, Bell acknowledged the ""mistakes"" he had made in an Instagram video, but claimed some of the rumors about him were not true.

""A lot of the news that you've been hearing, most of the news that you've heard recently, is entirely false and wrong, and I feel that you deserve and I owe you an explanation,"" he said.

Bell alleges it was ""reckless and irresponsible text messages"" exchanged with a fan for which he took a plea deal.

In 2020, Bell was accused of verbal and physical abuse by his ex-girlfriend, Melissa Lingafelt.

In a since-deleted TikTok video, Lingafelt alleged that the abuse began when she moved in with the actor at 16. They were in a relationship from August 2006 to February 2009.

""First off I'd like to start out by saying, I don't really care if anyone believes me, as this is my story and my life, and something that I went through. It wasn't until recently that I actually realized that abuse isn't something that all women have to go through.… I moved in with him, I was singing. It wasn't until about a year when the verbal abuse started,"" she said.

Lingafelt described the verbal abuse as ""the worst"" someone could ""ever imagine.""

""It then turned into physical: hitting, throwing, everything,"" she said. ""At the pinnacle of it, he drug [sic] me down the stairs of our house in Los Feliz. My face hit every step on the way down. I have photos of this. I don't even want to get into the underage girls thing.""

Bell said via a representative to Variety, ""I never abused my ex-girlfriend or did so many of the other things Melissa falsely claimed on her TikTok video. As our relationship ended – more than a decade ago – we, unfortunately, both called each other terrible names, as often happens when couples are breaking up. But that is it. Clearly, Melissa still felt close enough to me just last year that she was comfortable reaching out to ask me to provide her with financial support during a tough time (which I did). I do not know if today’s behavior is some kind of misguided quest for more money or attention. But I cannot and will not allow these offensive and defamatory allegations to go unchallenged and I am reviewing my legal options.""

Bell has been married to Janet Von Schmeling since 2018. They have one son together.

'Frasier' star Anthony LaPaglia reveals whether he’ll do reboot,"Frasier Crane is back – and Anthony LaPaglia is listening.

In February 2021, Paramount+ announced that the ‘90s sitcom ""Frasier"" would be revived for the streaming service, with original star Kelsey Grammer reprising his role as Dr. Frasier Crane.

LaPaglia, who had a recurring role as Daphne Moon’s (Jane Leeves) drunken brother Simon, told Fox News Digital he would be open to appearing in the reboot if he were asked. The Australian actor won an Emmy for the series.

""I would do it in a heartbeat,"" the 64-year-old said. ""But I’m pretty sure that I’m not in the architecture of the new [series]. I think the new one will be slightly different. John Mahoney is not there, and I don’t think David Hyde Pierce is in it either. I don’t know what form is taking, but I’m perfectly happy with what I did. It was great fun at the time. And sometimes revisiting things could spoil that memory. I hope it does well. I certainly want to know how it all unfolds.""

Mahoney, who starred as patriarch Martin Crane, passed away in 2018 at age 77. In November 2022, Grammer told People magazine that Hyde Pierce, who played Dr. Niles Crane, bowed out of the reboot.

""David basically decided he wasn’t really interested in repeating the performance of Niles,"" the 68-year-old told the outlet at the time about his on-screen brother, 64. Grammer emphasized that the reboot would focus on ""new friendships"" and would explain the absence of some of the original characters, including Mahoney.

In March 2023, it was announced that Bebe Neuwirth would reprise her role as Lilith in a guest-starring role.

LaPaglia said he runs into his former castmates ""once in a blue moon.""

""I think most actors might say the same thing,"" he explained. ""When you’re working on something, you develop these genuine relationships with people. But then when the project is over, you go off to work on something else. There are some actors that I’m still friends with, even if I speak to them twice a year. But that’s just the nature of the business, the nature of the beast. You find yourself away on location for a good part of the year. So maintaining friendships can be difficult… It’s not a normal life.""

Still, the star said he has fond memories from his time on set. He described having a close bond with ""the great"" Mahoney.

""He had a set of headshots that he would give out to fans, and I would go in there and write some really insulting stuff on his headshots,"" LaPaglia chuckled. ""And then he would find my headshot and write some really insulting stuff on mine! And we’d put them in each other’s dressing rooms. We had a very funny, juvenile relationship, but we used to make each other laugh a lot.""

""I had a really good time with him,"" LaPaglia continued. ""Kelsey was great and the rest of the cast was great, but John Mahoney and I really hit it off… He was just a very funny, generous guy. I didn’t even realize what an accomplished actor he was. In between ‘Frasier,’ he kept busy doing theater. He also had a substantial career even before ‘Frasier.’ And he’s from Manchester in England, which floored me because his accent was perfect. I miss him.""

LaPaglia also described Grammer as ""welcoming on set.""

""My favorite memory? That’s easy,"" he said. ""I remember walking on the set early one morning and I suddenly heard this beautiful piano piece. I don’t remember what piece it was, but it was a classical piece. I just thought, ‘That’s nice, they’re piping that music through the sound stage.’ I walked around and, in the corner, there was a piano with Kelsey playing this beautiful piece. That just blew me away. I had no idea.""

These days, LaPaglia is looking ahead. He’s starring in ""Florida Man"" – no, not the meme. It’s a scripted series premiering on Netflix. It stars Édgar Ramirez, who plays a struggling ex-cop and gambling addict who owes big time to a Philly mobster. He returns home to his home state of Florida, only for his woes to heat up. The show, which LaPaglia described as ""a black comedy,"" also stars Abbey Lee, Clark Gregg and Paul Schneider, among others.

""Édgar is an absolute sweetheart,"" said LaPaglia about the ""American Crime Story"" actor. ""He is probably one of the most considerate, level-headed actors that I’ve worked with – and that’s saying something! He was just very kind and very involved in the scenes. We had a lot of fun off-camera as well. He has a great sense of humor.""

LaPaglia admitted he wasn’t familiar with the ""Florida Man"" phenomenon, or kooky criminals causing havoc in the Sunshine State.

""Listen, here in Australia we have Darwin, which is like the Florida equivalent,"" he chuckled. ""People go there to literally disappear… And I think that can be very attractive to some people. There’s a different set of rules there. Like Florida, it’s a diaspora of all kinds of people. I used to think it was the weather, like in Florida. But now? I’m not so sure.""

SERIAL KILLER FEATURED IN NETFLIX SERIES 'THE SERPENT' SAYS HE NEVER KILLED ANYONE

""You know, I’m really enjoying my time being back on television,"" he reflected. ""As this story progresses, it gets more and more absurd – or it gets more and more ‘Florida Man.’""

NASA names crew of first manned mission to moon in over 50 years,"NASA, on Monday, named the four-person crew who will be launched to the moon on the first manned crew to the lunar satellite in over 50 years.

The crew consists of three firsts for the space agency, including the first woman, first person of color, and first Canadian to be sent to the moon.

""The Artemis II crew represents thousands of people working tirelessly to bring us to the stars. This is their crew, this is our crew, this is humanity's crew,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a press release. ""NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Hammock Koch, and CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen, each has their own story, but, together, they represent our creed: E pluribus unum – out of many, one. Together, we are ushering in a new era of exploration for a new generation of star sailors and dreamers – the Artemis Generation.""

NASA made the announcement on Monday afternoon at Ellington Field near Johnson Space Center in Houston.

The agency also announced that Wiseman will serve as commander of the mission, while Glover will be the pilot, Koch will be specialist 1 and Hansen will be specialist 2 on a 10-day Artemis II test flight intended to prove the Orion spacecraft’s life-support systems while also validating the techniques and capabilities necessary for humans to live and work in deep space, according to a press release.

The test flight will also pave the way for long-term human exploration on the moon in the future, with eyes set on eventually venturing out to Mars.

NASA ARTEMIS 1 MISSION: MEGAROCKET AND ORION SPACECRAFT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES AMID HISTORIC RETURN TO THE MOON

""For the first time in more than 50 years, these individuals – the Artemis II crew – will be the first humans to fly to the vicinity of the Moon. Among the crew are the first woman, first person of color, and first Canadian on a lunar mission, and all four astronauts will represent the best of humanity as they explore for the benefit of all,"" said Director Vanessa Wyche, NASA Johnson. ""This mission paves the way for the expansion of human deep space exploration and presents new opportunities for scientific discoveries, commercial, industry and academic partnerships and the Artemis Generation.""

All but one of the astronauts have made trips into space.

The Artemis II mission will be Wiseman’s second trip into space, with his first trip taking place on an expedition to the International Space Station from May through November 2014.

NASA ARTEMIS I MOON MISSION ROCKET DAMAGED MORE THAN EXPECTED IN LAUNCH

The mission is also Glover’s and Koch’s second flight to space, both of whom spent time on the space station. Glover served as a pilot onboard SpaceX Crew-1 which returned to Earth in May 2021 after 168 days in space, while Koch served as a flight engineer on the space station, took part in the first all-female spacewalk and set the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, after spending 328 days in space.

Canada’s Hansen has never been to space but served as a fighter pilot and colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces. He was one of two recruits selected by the Canadian Space Agency in May 2009 and was the first Canadian to lead a NASA astronaut class, NASA said.

""We are going back to the Moon and Canada is at the center of this exciting journey,"" said the Honorable François-Philippe Champagne, the minister responsible for the Canadian Space Agency. ""Thanks to our longstanding collaboration with NASA, a Canadian astronaut will fly on this historic mission.

""Canada’s participation in the Artemis program is not only a defining chapter of our history in space, but also a testament to the friendship and close partnership between our two nations,"" he added.

John Lennon's ex May Pang on Yoko Ono pushing her to have affair with married Beatle,"May Pang was just 22 years old when she reluctantly became John Lennon’s girlfriend — at the request of his wife Yoko Ono.

The couple’s former assistant, who found herself in the middle of an 18-month romance with the ""Imagine"" singer, is telling her story in a new documentary, ""The Lost Weekend: A Love Story."" The film, which made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2022, features rarely heard home recordings and a candid interview with Lennon’s eldest son, Julian.

In it, Pang aims to set the record straight on her story, one that has become part of rock mythology since Lennon died in 1980. A spokesperson for Ono, 90, indicated to Fox News Digital that there would be no response at this time regarding Pang's documentary.

""It’s hard to believe, but it is 50 years now since my relationship with John began,"" the 72-year-old told Fox News Digital. ""There was so much of my own story being told by other people that had no idea. It got the best of me after a while. It was my life, and everybody else is telling it. Many people still think I only spent a weekend with him. They didn't know the truth.""

Pang, the American-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, grew up in New York City’s Spanish Harlem during the ‘60s, when she discovered her first love – rock ‘n’ roll. In the film, Pang admitted her favorite Beatle as a teen was Ringo Starr, noting she ""was partial to blue eyes.""

In 1969, the 19-year-old scored a gig as an office assistant for Apple Records, the Fab Four’s label. In 1970, Lennon and Ono relocated from London to New York. Pang, eager to escape the mundane office life, began working as the couple's personal assistant.

BEATLE RINGO STARR REFLECTS ON SPREADING 'PEACE AND LOVE' FOLLOWING THE '60S: 'IT WAS PART OF HOW WE FELT'

""They were doing two movies, ‘Up Your Legs Forever’ and ‘Fly,’"" Pang recalled. ""It was a bit kooky, but I rolled with it because it was fun. … And they were larger than life. You read about them all the time in the papers, how they were spreading their message of peace around the world. And when I started to work for them, everything became fast paced. I didn’t get much sleep.""

Lennon, 10 years older than Pang, had been married to Ono since 1969. However, the pair, depicted as soulmates, had hit a rough patch. Ono, who wanted some time apart, was eager to save her marriage. It was in 1973 when Ono asked the young assistant to date her husband in hopes of keeping him company.

Pang said that day seemed like any other at the couple’s office — at first.

""She came in and sat across from me and said, ‘I’ve gotta talk to you,'"" Pang recalled. ""In my head, I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God, I haven’t even had my first cup of coffee yet. … I grab my pad, my pen, and I’m ready to write. And she said, ‘John and I are not getting along.’ I said, ‘I’m so sorry to hear [that].' And then she says, ‘You know, John’s gonna go out with other people.’ And I thought, ‘OK, now we’re into another territory. Who can this be? We are adding another person to this mix?’ And then she says, ‘But you know what? You don’t have a boyfriend.’""

""I’m going, ‘I’m not interested, I’m not interested,’"" said Pang. ""She goes, ‘Oh, I know, but I think you’ll be good for him.’ I said, ‘I don’t want to go out with him.’ Now, people don’t realize I’ve worked there for three years. I was very happy with the job. … That’s all I wanted to do. All of a sudden, she says, ‘Go out with John Lennon.’ He was not John Lennon as everybody out there saw him. He was John Lennon, this man I worked for. … So I wasn’t interested.""

""It was hard to process,"" she added. ""I said no. And she kept saying, ‘You’d be good for him.’ She walks out of the room, and I just sat there. For a split second, I’m going, ‘What just happened?’ And tears started to just form in my eyes. I didn’t know where I was going. I didn’t know what to do.""

'50S STAR ANGIE DICKINSON ON FRANK SINATRA AND WHY SHE NEVER MARRIED 'LOVE OF MY LIFE'

At first, neither Pang nor Lennon seemed interested. But their attraction for each other became undeniable. He first stole a kiss from her at the elevator of the Dakota, where he lived with Ono. Soon, Lennon ""charmed the pants off of me."" In the film, Pang admitted she cried the first time they had sex, not knowing where the relationship would lead.

The pair bonded over their mutual love of music. Pang attempted to go with the flow as Lennon let his hair down. The two became inseparable, she said.

""I didn’t think he was attracted to me,"" Pang admitted. ""It was a big surprise. Despite everything that was said, it was he who pursued it more than anything else. I was just trying to hold back. … And you don’t want to be hurt either.""

At first glance, the couple seemed like any other. They shared deep conversations over songs, enjoyed dinners together at a local diner, jetted off to Los Angeles, where they spent time with other musicians and made each other laugh behind closed doors. Lennon drew comedic sketches for Pang. For her 23rd birthday, Lennon bought her an orange Plymouth Barracuda.

Pang claimed that Ono, suspecting possibly more was unfolding, would call up to 15 times a day to check in.

The whirlwind romance was not all sweetness. In the film, Pang described how Lennon, in a drunken rage, smashed up their LA pad. She also detailed how Lennon recorded his ""Rock ‘n’ Roll"" album with notorious music producer Phil Spector, who, according to Pang, liked poppers and guns.

The relationship carried on and, in 1974, the pair moved in together. Pang even encouraged Lennon to heal his relationship with Julian. At the time, he hadn’t seen his firstborn in several years.

""He hadn’t seen [his ex-wife Cynthia] since he walked out the door,"" Pang explained. ""It was time for Julian to come to visit him, and [Lennon] was really nervous. I remember he kept pacing like a tiger, smoking up a storm. I told him, ‘You’re not alone. I know this is hard, but I’ll be there.’ I just thought it was so important for Julian’s sake. I just remember Julian running into his arms. It was beautiful. I just wanted to be there as a buffer. And they all finally got a chance to sit down and talk about how they felt. Once that was cleared up, he didn’t have this angst anymore. … That’s exactly what I wanted for Julian.""

As the relationship between father and son healed, Pang developed a lifelong friendship with Cynthia. It was one that lasted until Cynthia died in 2015.

'ST. ELSEWHERE' STAR BONNIE BARTLETT DANIELS REFLECTS ON PAST OPEN MARRIAGE: 'THAT WAS VERY PAINFUL'

According to the film, Lennon initially agreed to Ono’s request for a divorce in 1974. He even told Pang, ""I’ll be a free man in six months."" But it never happened. Lennon claimed he was receiving pushback from Ono. Pang said she believed the relationship surprised Ono, who then wanted her husband back. Knowing that Lennon was trying to quit smoking to conserve his famous voice, Ono allegedly told him she knew a hypnotist who could help him. All he had to do was come back home.

Once Lennon went back to Ono to take her up on her offer, Pang knew her relationship was over. The couple called it quits in early 1975. Over the years, she said, they would see each other.

Pang said she last spoke to Lennon during Memorial Day weekend 1980. It was a nearly two-hour conversation over the phone that concluded with Lennon saying, ""I’m going to see you soon.""

They never saw each other again.

""Our time together never really ended as it were,"" she said. ""We didn’t get closure.""

In December 1980, Lennon was gunned down by a crazed fan outside his New York City apartment. He was 40.

Over the years, a devastated Pang reinvented herself, pursuing careers in writing and jewelry design. Today, she looks back at her time with Lennon fondly, only choosing to remember the good times they shared, not what might have been.

""I don’t know if I have actually coped with [his loss] completely,"" Pang admitted. ""I just think of the happy moments, the things that we’ve done together. I feel like he’s still surrounding me. So, no matter what, he’s there.""",2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z
"Marilyn Monroe asked Judy Garland this haunting question, author says","Marilyn Monroe had one important question for Judy Garland.

It was 1962 and the Hollywood stars were at a party. Garland had no idea it would be the last time she would see Monroe. The actress passed away suddenly that same year at age 36 from a barbiturate overdose.

The encounter stayed with the ""Wizard of Oz"" icon over the years before her own brief life came to an end.

""In the literature that exists about Judy Garland, she always told the story that… Marilyn Monroe got her into a corner and asked Judy, ‘Aren’t you afraid? Aren’t you afraid of life?’"" Lawrence Schulman told Fox News Digital. ""And Garland said, ‘Sure, we’re all afraid of life.’ Marilyn Monroe, to some degree, had an even more fragile personality than Judy Garland. They were both fragile personalities, and I think that’s why they liked each other because they felt the same stress and difficulties in life.""

""I think that’s what brought them together,"" Schulman added.

Schulman has translated a new book written by French author Bertrand Tessier titled ""Judy Garland: Splendor and Downfall of a Legend."" It features over 100 rare photos, many published for the first time, including what is believed to be the last known snapshot taken of Garland days before she died in 1969 at age 47. Like Monroe, Garland passed away from a drug overdose.

'50S BLONDE BOMBSHELL CLEO MOORE, THE NEXT MARILYN MONROE, MAY HAVE DIED OF BROKEN HEART, AUTHOR CLAIMS

Schulman pointed out that Garland reflected on her haunting encounter with Monroe in a 1967 article for Ladies Home Journal.

""I knew Marilyn Monroe and loved her dearly,"" Garland told the outlet. ""She asked me for help. Me! I didn’t know what to tell her. One night at a party at Clifton Webb’s house, Marilyn followed me from room to room. ‘I don’t want to get too far away from you,’ she said. ‘I’m scared.’ I told her, ‘We’re all scared. I’m scared too.’ ‘If we could just talk,’ she said, ‘I know you’d understand.’ I said, ‘Maybe I would. If you’re scared, call me and come on over. We’ll talk about it.’""

According to Schulman, the women first met in 1959. And while they weren’t believed to be close friends, they were kindred spirits in a town that both made and broke them.

""They probably met two or three times,"" said Schulman. ""But they felt for each other, that’s for sure.""

When Garland learned of Monroe’s death, she remarked, ""You take pills to sleep, you wake up anyway, but you have forgotten you have taken them. So you take more…""

Garland’s ex-husband Sid Luft later shared in his memoir that Monroe never had the chance to take up Garland’s offer. He described Monroe as ""a quiet presence"" who was ""sweet and very unhappy.""

""She was frustrated and disappointed,"" he recalled.

""That beautiful girl was frightened of aloneness – the same thing I'd been afraid of,"" Garland reflected. ""Like me, she was just trying to do her job – garnish some delightful whipped cream onto some people's lives, but Marilyn and I never got a chance to talk. I had to leave for England and I never saw that sweet, dear girl again. I wish I had been able to talk to her the night she died.""

""I don't think Marilyn really meant to harm herself,"" Garland continued. ""It was partly because she had too many pills available, then was deserted by her friends. You shouldn't be told you're completely irresponsible and be left alone with too much medication. It's too easy to forget.""

But Garland had her own demons to battle. Years of addiction to prescription pills and heavy alcohol abuse ravaged her body and celebrated voice. As a child, she was put on extreme diets to please studio executives who would heavily scrutinize her weight. She worked excruciatingly long hours on set, using stimulants, or ""pep pills,"" to keep her performing when needed. A domineering stage mother ensured those pills were taken. As an adult, Garland was unlucky in love, as she, like Monroe, sought a father figure who would take care of her.

Garland's Los Angeles Times obituary noted that she ""had suffered from hepatitis, exhaustion, kidney ailments, nervous breakdowns, near-fatal drug reactions, overweight, underweight and injuries suffered in falls.""

‘BEVERLY HILLBILLIES’ STAR BUDDY EBSEN LOST 'THE WIZARD OF OZ’ ROLE FOR THIS HORRIFYING REASON, DAUGHTER SAYS

Despite leading a decades-long career as a child star, Garland was plagued with financial mismanagement and embezzlement. According to reports, the mother of three owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes to the IRS. Leading up to her death, she performed sold-out shows, but a majority of her earnings were reportedly seized for back taxes.

""It’s very hard for people to get a grasp that Judy Garland, toward the end of her life, was homeless,"" Schulman explained. ""She was living in hotels, with friends going from place to place, and didn’t have $5 in her pocketbook. So, there is tragedy there. She was around in the 1930s. She was doing films, records and radio – all that stuff – … and she had nothing. What she did have is an addiction to uppers and downers.""

""… She had a house in Los Angeles until 1967, and she couldn’t pay her mortgage,"" Schulman continued. ""She couldn’t pay her taxes. So she had to sell her house to pay her taxes. And from that period on in 1967, she was wandering. She was nowhere. She was sleeping on floors and sleeping… at friends’ places.""

While Garland has long been depicted as a ""walking casualty,"" Schulman said her life wasn’t all tragic. He described how in the months leading up to her death, Garland was also hopeful about what the future held for her.

""When she died, she was living in London,"" Schulman explained. ""… She had rented a small cottage…. It was very small, not a luxurious place at all. But she was comfortable. She didn’t have a lot of money, but she was recently married to her fifth husband, a guy named Mickey Deans. In terms of the very end of her life, she was stable, happy, getting by. She was in a better place. She seemed to be happily married. She was working. She was still a great star and very well-known… I’m not saying there is no tragedy there, but at the very end, I think she found a certain sense of peace.""

""She wasn’t a tragic person,"" Schulman continued. ""She was a very happy person. If you see photos of her [from] the end of her life, despite that she was in a terrible financial condition, despite that she was in poor health, she was very happy… In Bertrand’s biography, it too shows a side of her which was very joyous… very happy and very pleasant to the very end.""

Schulman pointed out a photograph taken of Garland a few days before her death, which is in the book.

""She died in London, but she was in New York a few days before,"" he explained. ""And she’s all smiles. Her smile is a mile wide. And I wanted that photo to be there to show people that she wasn’t such a tragic figure as they imagined.""

According to Schulman, Garland did make efforts to get clean from drugs. However, her ""addictive personality"" got in her way.

""She never went to a Betty Ford clinic because there were no Betty Ford clinics,"" said Schulman. ""But there were periods where she was relatively clean. When you see her in videos nowadays or on recordings, she’s in good shape. There’s no slurring of her words. She’s not acting strange. She tried several times to reduce her intake of these pills… But in the end, it was a lifelong battle. She was seriously medicated, and that’s what killed her. She struggled to get off the stuff all her life. She never succeeded.""

Today, Schulman hopes Garland will be remembered as a complex human being, one who was hopeful she would reach the end of the rainbow during hardships.

""In the worst of situations, she smiled,"" said Schulman. ""She always had hope despite everything.""",2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z
"Yellen says global economy is in a 'better place' than expected, despite banking upheaval","Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday struck an optimistic tone about the state of the global economy, saying that it is faring better than many expected in the fall despite persistent inflation and recent turmoil within the banking sector.

""During the G20 [meeting] in February, I said that the global economy was in a better place than many predicted last fall. That basic picture remains largely unchanged,"" Yellen said during remarks prepared for delivery at the start of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings.

The meetings come just weeks after the collapse of two regional lenders in the U. S. – Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank – rattled global markets amid fears of a more expansive financial crisis. Swiss lender Credit Suisse also teetered on the edge of failure before UBS snapped up its smaller rival in a nearly $3.25 billion deal.

Within days, U. S. authorities took extraordinary steps to contain the fallout from the banks' failures and shore up wavering confidence in the financial system, including protecting all deposits at the two institutions – even those accounts that exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 insurance limit.

""The U. S. banking system remains sound, with strong capital and liquidity positions,"" Yellen said. ""The global financial system also remains resilient due to the significant reforms that nations took after the financial crisis.""

Her upbeat comments stand in contrast to the rather gloomy economic forecast released by the IMF on Tuesday morning. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Washington-based institution projected that global GDP will grow by just 2.8% this year – which represents a 0.1 percentage point decline from its previous forecast in January – before rising to 3% in 2024.

HOW THE BANKING CRISIS COULD HAMMER SMALL BUSINESSES

""The major forces that affected the world in 2022… seem likely to continue into 2023,"" the report said. ""But these forces are now overlaid by and interacting with new financial stability concerns. A hard landing – particularly for advanced economies – has become a much larger risk. Policymakers may face difficult trade-offs to bring sticky inflation down and maintain growth while also preserving financial stability.""

The contrast is even sharper in developed nations, which are struggling to absorb the effects of tighter monetary policy after a decade of ultra-low interest rates. About 90% of advanced economies are expected to see a decline in GDP this year, with the IMF projecting meager growth of just 1.3% in 2023 and 1.4% next year.

Dee Snider recalls 'violent' fan encounter,"Dee Snider has showed off his vocal range for decades as the lead singer of Twisted Sister.

His unabashed love for stage performance helped him create his trademark persona to front the band, complete with long, blond curly hair, shredded clothes and theatrical makeup. Millions of fans from around the world have rocked out to Snider at a Twisted Sister show.

Fresh off ""The Masked Singer"" competition, where he took the stage as ""Doll,"" Snider reminisced on a particularly ""strange encounter"" when he was violently confronted by a fan.

""They tend to be violent,"" Snider exclusively told Fox News Digital about fan experiences, recalling when one groupie ""put a straight razor to my throat outside a club.""

""The line between love and hate is very fine,"" Snider said.

""This is back in the bar days, and I was leaving at the end of the show late at night. You know, you have to take your makeup, everybody's gone. It's four in the morning.""

He recalled getting to his car when ""this guy comes and sticks his hand in, and he goes, ‘Hey, Dee, How’s it going?' and puts a straight razor to my throat. He was upset I didn't acknowledge him in some fashion.""

The heavy metal singer said he ""threw the car in reverse"" and then ""pushed the guy's arm to the ceiling"" before speeding away.

""I got out of there, but that was crazy,"" he said. ""That's the thing with fandom … the fine line between love and hate.""

DEE SNIDER APPROVES UKRAINIANS' USE OF ‘WE’RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT' AMID RUSSIAN INVASION

He certainly knows a thing or two about walking the fine line. Known for one of the most iconic songs of all time, Snider said he knew ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" was going to be a hit when he wrote the lyrics.

However, Snider had no idea the song would go ""far beyond the genre of the era.""

""It's also a folk song at this point that, and I'm sure it will continue on being shared from generation to generation,"" he said. ""It's really an honor to have created something that people connect with on so many levels, and to see that and just know that it will live on after I'm gone.""

""It's sort of like a blessing,"" he explained. ""When they said, you know, we want to use it to fight for stricter gun regulation, I said, 'I'm a gun owner. My wife says I have too many guns. I don't have any AK-47s. I don't have any assault rifles, and I definitely think we need intelligent gun control.' We've needed it for a long time. So, I said absolutely with my blessing. Use it.""

He has also battled against controversial usage of the anthem, which he said was written with intent for speaking up on ""personal freedom.""

""I will never say you can't use a song because that's censorship,"" he said of the many groups who have contacted him to use the hit. ""My problem is that people assume because it's my voice, and I'm the songwriter, the general public assumes you're endorsing them.""

While he has had decades of experience wearing platforms on stage, Snider said that performing as ""Doll"" on ""The Masked Singer"" was ""brutal.""

Snider – whose full name is Daniel Snider – performed in a sparkling blue dress with towering heels and a massive head piece concealing his identity throughout the FOX show.

""I think Bill Shatner said it best when it was revealed. He said, ‘Thank God I'm out of that suit,’"" Snider joked.

""I think it's something that the audience, viewers don't really get, and I wish they understood more. Well, same on ‘Celebrity Apprentice,’ actually – just how difficult it is for the performers.""

Snider added, ""Very disorienting, almost like a sensory deprivation situation.""

He gave some insight into the arduous process of perfecting his stage presence on ""The Masked Singer.""

""You know, that wasn’t the first time I sang that song last night? I sang it like eight times. Plus we were singing the song for the next episode,"" he said. ""My throat was burnt out.

""They were going, ‘Well, your gravelly voice,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah I was hoping it wasn’t so gravelly,' but I was torched. It was really difficult.""

Despite the physical discomfort wearing the suit and hours of singing, Snider was glad to be part of the experience.

""The audience loves that show,"" he said. ""It's such a guilty pleasure, and it really brings people joy. So, you know, that part … I'm really happy about.""

"As Earth warms, more 'flash droughts' suck soil, plants dry","* A new study found that continued climate change worsens droughts by making them more severe — especially flash droughts which are creating an even bigger crop-killing footprint.

* Flash droughts occur when air gets so hot and dry that it sucks the water out of plants and soil.

Climate change is making droughts faster and more furious, especially a specific fast-developing heat-driven kind that catch farmers by surprise, a new study found.

The study in Thursday’s journal Science found droughts in general are being triggered faster. But it also showed that a special and particularly nasty sudden kind — called ""flash droughts"" by experts — is casting an even bigger crop-killing footprint.

It comes only in the growing season – mostly summer, but also spring and fall – and is insidious because it’s caused not just by the lack of rain or snow that's behind a typical slow-onset drought, hydrologists and meteorologists said.

What happens is the air gets so hot and so dry that it sucks water right out of plants and soil.

""It’s the increasing thirstiness of the atmosphere,"" said UCLA and National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Daniel Swain, who wasn’t part of the study. Swain called the issue ""very relevant in a warming climate.""

CA RESERVOIRS REPLENISHED FOLLOWING RECENT STORMS, WITH SOME OVERFILLED

The term flash drought was coined around 2000 but it really took off in 2012, when a $30 billion sudden drought struck the central United States, one of the worst droughts since the infamous Dust Bowl devastated the Plains in the 1930s, according to the study.

""Because it occurs very, very fast people started to focus on this new phenomenon,"" said study lead author Xing Yuan, dean of the School of Hydrology and Water Resources at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in China. ""For the 2012 drought, actually the drought just developed in a very severe condition just within a month.""

Most of China’s Yangtze River basin last summer was struck by a flash drought that developed within only a month due to high temperatures, which also triggered wildfires, Yuan said. Parts of the river dried up and there was an energy shortage in southern China because hydropower wouldn’t work, he said.

""It developed very fast so you don’t have enough time to prepare for this drought,"" Yuan said.

Another sudden drought happened in the U. S. Southeast in 2016 and was a factor in devastating wildfires in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, said Jason Otkin, a study co-author and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The current drought in the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle and Kansas started two years ago as a rapid onset drought, said Joel Lisonbee, a climatologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Integrated Drought Information System in Colorado. He wasn’t part of the study but praised it, saying ""essentially a warmer world allows for faster onset of drought.""

Yuan, Otkin and their research team looked back at droughts, how fast they occurred and what kind they were, across the globe since 1951 and found flash droughts are happening more often in nearly three-quarters of the climate regions of the world. They also found droughts of all kinds happening faster.

Although they couldn’t quantify how much faster because of the variability in places and times, Yuan said it would be fair to say droughts are happening weeks earlier than they once did.

Yuan said some of the bigger increases in sudden droughts have been in Europe and Australia. Outside experts pointed to the Amazon as prone to them.

""We have to pay attention to this phenomenon because it’s increasing,"" Yuan said.

Yuan’s team also used computer simulations – both with worst-case warming and more moderate warming – and projected that the proportion of flash droughts will increase in a warmer world and droughts will continue to keep happening faster.

By definition, flash droughts – because they result from low soil moisture levels – are especially bad for agriculture, experts said.

The trouble is there has been an old way of thinking that ""we have months or years before we need to worry about drought,"" said Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

That’s the reason why Svoboda, who wasn’t part of this study, said he pioneered the term ""flash drought’’ and wanted to ""dispel the notion that droughts only manifest themselves over long period of time.""

Svoboda's agency recommends that farmers, ranchers, municipal water suppliers and hydropower plants come up with plans for droughts. For example, farmers and ranchers should know how susceptible they are to drought and have alternative plans for plantings or foraging.

NOAA's Lisonbee said in an email that the problem is ""in a slowly evolving drought if a farmer thinks the season ahead will be dry, they may consider a more drought-tolerant crop that season, but when a flash drought occurs it is likely the crops are already in the ground and there is little that can be done.""",2023-04-13T00:00:00.000Z
"Webb telescope captures warped space, galaxies billions of light-years away","NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured the fabric of space-time being warped.

In an image captured by the observatory's NIRCam instrument, distant galaxies are magnified and warped due to an effect called gravitational lensing.

Gravitational lensing occurs when a celestial object like the foreground galaxy cluster has such a massive gravitational pull that it warps time and space around it.

The lensing galaxy cluster, known as SDSS J1226+2149, lies at a distance of around 6.3 billion light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices.

""Light follows that bend instead of traveling in a straight line, distorting and brightening what’s behind the object,"" the Webb team explained on Twitter.

A distant galaxy, known as the Cosmic Seahorse, is seen with a long distorted arc near the core, with its brightness greatly magnified by the gravitational lens.

The galaxies appear like bright smears of light spread throughout the image.

Using gravitation lensing, astronomers are able to study objects that would otherwise be too far away, revealing some of the most distant galaxies humanity has ever encountered.

NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON SAYS JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE IS WINDOW TO UNIVERSE 'NEVER BEFORE ACHIEVED'

This effect here has let scientists study star formation in the Cosmic Seahorse.

In order to do so, the team relied on previous studies from the Hubble Space Telescope, which the European Space Agency said provided the ""prescription"" for this gravitational lens.

""As well as revealing how quickly stars form and characterizing the environments in these galaxies that gave rise to new stars, these observations will demonstrate the capabilities of Webb and provide richly detailed datasets to the astronomical community,"" the agency said.

This is not the first time Webb has captured such an effect.

A previous image featuring the galaxy cluster RX J2129 showed three different images of the same supernova-hosting galaxy.

The telescope also captured never-before-seen details in a region known as Pandora's Cluster, with the combined mass of three galaxy clusters creating a gravitational lens and allowing scientists to observe more distant galaxies in the early universe.",2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z
Rep. Waltz warns intel leaks are 'far more serious' than the White House is leading on,"Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla. warned on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday that the threat posed by the leak of ""highly-classified"" U. S. intelligence documents is far more serious and significant than the Biden administration is projecting and called for oversight of security efforts at the Department of Defense.

LEAKER OF CLASSIFIED US INTELLIGENCE WORKS ON MILITARY BASE, POSTED THE DOCUMENTS ON DISCORD: REPORT

REP. MIKE WALTZ: I find this far more serious, more significant than what we're hearing from the White House. And what jumped out at me is that we have this massive security infrastructure within the Defense Department, our intelligence and our intelligence community, secure, compartmented facilities by the thousands, secure I. T. systems, security background checks that take months, if not years, and all of this costs billions and billions of dollars. Yet, this seems to have been done so simply. And it really drives me as a member of the intelligence community, from an intelligence committee, from an oversight standpoint, to look at that infrastructure, how much money we're spending on how effective is it, really? And then also, all of the insider threat programs that supposedly were put in place since the Snowden leaks. At the end of the day, we've built these massive forts kind of around our classified intelligence, as we should. Yet, it's the insiders that seem to be the biggest threats. And that's what I want to dig into when we get back to Washington and start conducting oversight.

BIDEN SAYS FEDS 'GETTING CLOSE' TO FINDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT LEAKER

President Biden said Thursday that the U. S. is ""getting close"" to finding the person responsible for leaking Pentagon documents that the Department of Defense has described as containing ""sensitive and highly-classified material.""

""I can’t right now [give an update]. There is a full-blown investigation going on with the intelligence community and Justice Department and they are getting close,"" Biden told reporters during his trip to Ireland. ""I don’t have an answer for you.""

The president also said ""I’m concerned that it happened but there is nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of great consequence.""

Bidens comments came after The Washington Post published a report claiming the person behind the leak is a man in his 20s who worked on a military base and shared the classified information on the chat app Discord.

The outlet reportedly spoke to a fellow member of the chat group the leaker ran on Discord. The Post's teenage source claimed he knew the leaker's real name and where he lived but said he would not help authorities locate him.

Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson might actually be brothers after shocking family revelation,"Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson may be closer than fans think.

During a podcast interview, McConaughey revealed that his longtime friend Harrelson may actually be related to the ""Dazed and Confused"" star.

""You know, where I start and where he ends, and where he starts and I end, has always been like a murky line … that’s part of our bromance, right?"" McConaughey began to explain on Kelly Ripa’s ""Let’s Talk Off Camera"" podcast with SiriusXM.

""My kids call him Uncle Woody. His kids call me Uncle Matthew… you see pictures of us and my family thinks a lot of pictures of him are me. His family thinks a lot of pictures of me are him.""

The 53-year-old actor continued to share that during a family vacation, his mother brought up a special connection she may have had with Harrelson’s father.

""In Greece a few years ago, we’re sitting around talking about how close we are and our families,"" McConaughey noted.

""My mom is there, and she says, ‘Woody, I knew your dad.’ Everyone was aware of the ellipses that my mom left after ‘knew.’ It was a loaded K-N-E-W.""

After McConaughey discovered these family details, he admitted he investigated his mother’s past to seek the truth.

The father of three shared that Harrelson’s father may have linked up with his mother during McConaughey’s parent’s divorce.

""Then there [are] possible receipts and places out in West Texas where there might have been a gathering or a meeting, or a ‘knew’ moment.""

Once McConaughey confessed the shocking revelation, Ripa then asked if he or Harrelson have taken a DNA test to confirm the results.

""This is what we're on the precipice of now,"" the ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" star responded.

""It's a little easier for Wood to say, 'Come on, let's do it,' because what's the skin in it for him?"" he jokingly pointed out.

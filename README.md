# Final Project
Our goal with this project is to build multiple models which can sort out human
written news articles from articles written by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT. These AI generated
articles will be created using a real headline scraped from various news sites.

Included in this repo are three python notebook files. The first one, `gather-data.ipynb` contains the code we used to build our dataset, mostly commented out, as we have that saved in a csv. It also includes our Naive Bayes model. Next is `data_vis.ipynb` which includes our data exploration, looking at, analyzing and visualizing several different attributes of the articles. Lastly there is `random_forest.ipynb`, which contains our Random Forest model.

Python libraries that are required to run these three files are:
*   Pandas
*   Scikit-learn
*   NumPy
*   Seaborn
*   Matplotlib
*   SciPy
*   nltk
*   openai
*   wordcloud
*   readability

The last of which can be install by running the following commands
`pip install py-readability-metrics`
`python -m nltk.downloader punkt`

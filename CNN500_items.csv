                      When customers at Silicon Valley Bank rushed to withdraw billions of dollars last month, venture capitalist Arlan Hamilton stepped in to help some of the founders of color who panicked about losing access to payroll funds. As a Black woman with nearly 10 years of business experience, Hamilton knew the options for those startup founders were limited. SVB had a reputation for servicing people from underrepresented communities like hers. Its failure has reignited concerns from industry experts about lending discrimination in the banking industry and the resulting disparities in capital for people of color. Hamilton, the 43-year-old founder and managing partner of Backstage Capital, said that when it comes to entrepreneurs of color, ""we're already in the smaller house. We already have the rickety door and the thinner walls. And so, when a tornado comes by, we're going to get hit harder."" Established in 1983, the midsize California tech lender was America's 16th largest bank at the end of 2022 before it collapsed on March 10. SVB provided banking services to nearly half of all venture-backed technology and life-sciences companies in the United States. Hamilton, industry experts and other investors told CNN the bank was committed to fostering a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, said Hamilton, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. ""When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,"" said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Martinez is also an official member of the Forbes Coaches Council, an invitation-only organization for business and career coaches. She said SVB was an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs of color and offered their clients discounted tech tools and research funding.  Many women and people of color say they are turned away  Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.  In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. ""We know there's historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that's inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,"" Martinez told CNN. Asya Bradley is an immigrant founder of multiple tech companies like Kinley, a financial services business aiming to help Black Americans build generational wealth. Following SVB's collapse, Bradley said she joined a WhatsApp group of more than 1,000 immigrant business founders. Members of the group quickly mobilized to support one another, she said. Immigrant founders often don't have Social Security numbers nor permanent addresses in the United States, Bradley said, and it was crucial to brainstorm different ways to find funding in a system that doesn't recognize them. ""The community was really special because a lot of these folks then were sharing different things that they had done to achieve success in terms of getting accounts in different places. They also were able to share different regional banks that have stood up and been like, 'Hey, if you have accounts at SVB, we can help you guys,'"" Bradley said. Many women, people of color and immigrants opt for community or regional banks like SVB, Bradley says, because they are often rejected from the ""top four banks"" — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. In her case, Bradley said her gender might have been an issue when she could only open a business account at one of the ""top four banks"" when her brother co-signed for her.  ""The top four don't want our business. The top four are rejecting us consistently. The top four do not give us the service that we deserve. And that's why we've gone to community banks and regional banks such as SVB,"" Bradley said. None of the top four banks provided a comment to CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said the banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality. Last week, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN's Poppy Harlow that his bank has 30% of its branches in lower-income neighborhoods as part of a $30 billion commitment to Black and Brown communities across the country. Wells Fargo specifically pointed to its 2022 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion report, which discusses the bank's recent initiatives to reach underserved communities. The bank partnered last year with the Black Economic Alliance to initiate the Black Entrepreneur Fund — a $50 million seed, startup, and early-stage capital fund for businesses founded or led by Black and African American entrepreneurs. And since May 2021, Wells Fargo has invested in 13 Minority Depository Institutions, fulfilling its $50 million pledge to support Black-owned banks. Black-owned banks work to close the lending gap and foster economic empowerment in these traditionally excluded communities, but their numbers have been dwindling over the years, and they have far fewer assets at their disposal than the top banks. OneUnited Bank, the largest Black-owned bank in the United States, manages a little over $650 million in assets. By comparison, JPMorgan Chase manages $3.7 trillion in assets. SVB's collapse could spark future change, entrepreneur says   Because of these disparities, entrepreneurs also seek funding from venture capitalists. In the early 2010s, Hamilton intended to start her own tech company — but as she searched for investors, she saw that White men control nearly all venture capital dollars. That experience led her to establish Backstage Capital, a venture capital fund that invests in new companies led by underrepresented founders. ""I said, 'Well, instead of trying to raise money for one company, let me try to raise for a venture fund that will invest in underrepresented — and now we call them underestimated — founders who are women, people of color, and LGBTQ specifically,' because I am all three,"" Hamilton told CNN.  Since then, Backstage Capital has amassed a portfolio of nearly 150 different companies and has made over 120 diversity investments, according to data from Crunchbase. But Bradley, who is also an 'angel investor' of minority-owned businesses, said she remains ""really hopeful"" that community banks, regional banks and fintechs ""will all stand up and say, 'Hey, we are not going to let the good work of SVB go to waste.'""

                      San Francisco Police have arrested Nima Momeni in connection to the murder of Cash App founder Bob Lee, San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said during a news conference on Thursday. Scott described Momeni as a 38-year-old man from Emeryville, California. Scott said Momeni and Lee knew one another, but he didn't provide further details about their connection. California Secretary of State Records indicate that Momeni has been the owner of an IT business, which, according to its website, provides services like technical support. Momeni was taken into custody without incident, according to Scott, and taken to the San Francisco County jail where he was booked on one charge of murder. Lee was stabbed to death in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco early in the morning of April 4th. The moments following the stabbing attack were captured on surveillance video and in a 911 call to authorities, according to a local Bay Area news portal. The surveillance footage, reviewed by the online news site The San Francisco Standard, shows Lee walking alone on Main Street, ""gripping his side with one hand and his cellphone in the other, leaving a trail of blood behind him."" Many in the tech world and beyond responded to news of Lee's death with an outpouring of shock and grief. Some, including Elon Musk, also said the incident highlighted the fact that ""violent crime in SF is horrific.""  But on Thursday, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins criticized Musk's statement as ""reckless and irresponsible."" Jenkins said Musk's remark ""assumed incorrect circumstances"" about the death and effectively ""spreads misinformation"" while police were actively working to solve the case.  Lee was the former chief technology officer of Square who helped launch Cash App. He later joined MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency and digital payments startup, in 2021 as its chief product officer. Josh Goldbard, the CEO MobileCoin, previously told CNN: ""Bob was a dynamo, a force of nature. Bob was the genuine article. He was made for the world that is being born right now, he was a child of dreams, and whatever he imagined, no matter how crazy, he made real."" Earlier Thursday, San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Matt Dorsey expressed his gratitude to the police department's homicide detail for ""their tireless work to bring Bob Lee's killer to justice and for their arrest of a suspect this morning.""

                      Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know

                      So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 90 million income tax returns for 2022.  That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches. Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it's likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.  Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson. If you're in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail. Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won't cost you to submit a return. Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that's not necessarily so. Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:  Interest on your savings
            Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)
            Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle
            Unemployment income
            Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account
            Tips
            Gambling winnings
            Income from a rental property you own Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).  If you don't recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically. Here are some of the tax forms you may have received: W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs
            1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments 
            1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments
            1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution
            1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor
            1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn't get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022. 
            1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract
            SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received. ""Be aware that there's no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you're responsible for reporting it on your own,"" according to the Illinois CPA Society. One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you're eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven't done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you're 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings. Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you're using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer. Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you're owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank. What to do if you can't file by April 18: If you're not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.  Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven't paid by April 18. So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn't withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.  You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.  Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. ""The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,"" the agency notes in its instructions. If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select ""extension"" and then ""tax year 2022"" when given the option. You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don't pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances. If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state's revenue department, Martin said. Use this interactive tax assistant for basic questions you may have: The IRS provides an ""interactive tax assistant"" that can help you answer more than 50 basic questions pertaining to your individual circumstance on income, deductions, credits and other technical questions.

                      Behold the stuffed-crust bagel

                      In the 1990s, Pizza Hut unveiled an important cheese-in-bread innovation, the stuffed crust pizza. Now, Philadelphia cream cheese and H&H Bagels, a New York City-based bagel shop, are trying to please the carbohydrate- and dairy-loving communities with a new and dubious spin on the stuffed crust: The bagel stuffed with cream cheese.  But unlike stuffed-crust pizzas, the bagel is filled with cheese after it is baked, making it more of a cream cheese bagel donut, if not in spirit then at least in form.  The bagels are ""baked fresh daily and then cooled to be individually stuffed with Philly's signature cream cheese one at a time,"" according to Jay Rushin, CEO of  H&H. ""H&H Bagels use a pastry tool to pipe in the Philly cream cheese by hand,"" he added. ""The process leaves very small holes where the insertions are made, similar to a jelly donut.""  The obvious question, as is often the case with food mash-ups, is why. What's so wrong with slicing a bagel and slathering on a healthy amount of cream cheese? Why must we pre-cheese the bagel? Because, Philly owner Kraft Heinz and H&H say, the simple acts of cutting and spreading are taxed, at least in New York.   ""New York City may be the bagel capital of the world, but its residents incur a ludicrous 'bagel tax' each time they opt to purchase a bagel that's sliced and schmeared with cream cheese,"" the companies said in a release.  That's true, sort of. New York doesn't have a specific bagel tax, explained Ryan Cleveland, a representative of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. But certain food products, including baked goods, are tax exempt, while prepared foods are not.  ""It's when a bagel becomes a sandwich or a prepared food that it then becomes taxable,"" he said. In New York City, food sold at restaurants is taxed at 8.875%. Philadelphia and H&H plan to skirt this rule with the stuffed bagel, which is available at H&H's Manhattan locations for $1.90 each, from Friday through Tax Day on Tuesday, April 18; and also online. ""In today's landscape, people are juggling enough hurdles, and having to pay an extra tax to enjoy their favorite bagel with Philly cream cheese should simply not be one of them,"" said Keenan White, senior brand manager of Philadelphia cream cheese, in a statement.  White and Kraft Heinz may well care about their customers' tax payments. But for food companies, marketing stunts are about creating buzz and staying at the forefront of customers' minds when they visit the supermarket — or bagel shop.  Kraft in particular has in recent years been leaning into questionable combinations, like the Velveeta Martini and a hot dog flavored popsicle, to promote its brands and get attention.  Philadelphia cream cheese, which struggled with shortages in the past, turned that issue into a marketing opportunity as well. There's no problem with supply now, according to the brand.

                      NPR and PBS stop using Twitter after receiving 'government funded media' label

                      NPR on Wednesday said that it is suspending its use of Twitter after clashing with the social media company and its owner Elon Musk over a controversial new ""state-affiliated media"" label applied to its accounts. ""NPR's organizational accounts will no longer be active on Twitter because the platform is taking actions that undermine our credibility by falsely implying that we are not editorially independent,"" the broadcaster said in a statement. ""We are not putting our journalism on platforms that have demonstrated an interest in undermining our credibility and the public's understanding of our editorial independence."" Late last week, Twitter labeled the radio broadcaster as a ""state-affiliated media"" organization akin to foreign propaganda outlets such as Russia's RT and Sputnik. The move was quickly rebuked by NPR, which is publicly funded by listeners. NPR CEO John Lansing called the label ""unacceptable."" Twitter over the weekend updated the label to ""government-funded media."" In a final series of tweets — its first in over a week — NPR noted other places its work can be found, including through its app and newsletters, as well as on other social media platforms. ""Millions of Americans depend on NPR and their local public radio stations for the fact-based, independent, public service journalism they need to stay informed about the world and about their own communities,"" Lansing said in an email to NPR staff Wednesday. ""It would be a disservice to the serious work you all do here to continue to share it on a platform that is associating the federal charter for public media with an abandoning of editorial independence or standards."" In a series of tweets on Wednesday after NPR's announcement, Musk continued to spar with the outlet and accused it of being ""hypocritical"" in its explanations of how it's funded. US television broadcaster PBS later followed NPR's lead in announcing that it would stop tweeting after its accounts received the same ""government-funded media"" label. ""PBS stopped tweeting from our account when we learned of the change and we have no plans to resume at this time,"" it said in a statement Wednesday.  Earlier in the week, PBS had criticized the label, saying it ""leaves the inaccurate impression that PBS is wholly funded by the federal government. PBS is primarily funded by the public and philanthropic organizations, with only a small portion of our funding coming from entities affiliated with government."" The moves by NPR and PBS threaten to undermine one of Twitter's key selling points — its role as a central hub for news — especially if other outlets follow in NPR's footsteps. Twitter has also faced backlash over applying a similar ""government funded media"" label to the BBC, which is also primarily funded by the public.  In an interview with the BBC Tuesday, Musk acknowledged the pushback, saying, ""I know the BBC ... was not thrilled about being labeled 'state affiliated media.'"" ""Our goal is simply to ... be as truthful and accurate as possible,"" Musk said, adding that he planned to update the BBC's label to ""publicly funded."" It's just the latest example of Musk antagonizing media outlets. Twitter earlier this month also targeted the New York Times by removing the blue verification checkmark from its main account, after previously pledging to remove checks from all users verified under Twitter's legacy system. And the platform riled some journalists when it briefly restricted users from sharing links to a popular newsletter platform, a move it quickly walked back.  Meanwhile, Twitter also appears to have removed some restrictions on Russian government accounts that had been put in place following the outset of Russia's war in Ukraine. ""All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves,"" Musk said in a tweet commenting on the decision Sunday.  The chaos comes as Musk attempts to shore up Twitter's business, which he has repeatedly said was on the brink of bankruptcy and had just ""four months to live"" following his takeover.  Twitter has faced an exodus of advertisers, who have been concerned about increased hate speech on the platform and massive cuts to the company's workforce. In the meantime, Musk has taken on the uphill battle of encouraging users to pay $8 per month for the platform's subscription service. It's ""not fun at all"" and can sometimes be ""painful,"" the billionaire CEO told the BBC Tuesday of running the company, although he suggested that some Twitter advertisers are returning to the platform. --CNN's Oliver Darcy contributed to this report.

                      Even as rents are cooling in some parts of the country, it has never cost more to rent a Manhattan apartment as it did in March. Typically, rental activity builds from the spring to a peak in late summer, but median rent last month was the highest on record, according to a report from Douglas Elliman, a brokerage, and Miller Samuel, an appraisal and consultant firm. The median cost of renting an apartment in Manhattan was $4,175 in March. That's up 12.8% from a year ago and up 2% from February.  The previous record of $4,150 was set in July.  A one-bedroom apartment had a median rent of $4,150, up 9.6% from last year, while a two-bedroom apartment had a median rent of $5,680, up 18.3% from a year ago. A studio apartment rents for a median price of $3,190, up 16% from last year. While the median rent for all sizes of apartments taken together has reached a new high, this is not the skyrocketing rent rise seen in 2021, said Jonathan Miller, president and CEO of Miller Samuel.  ""It isn't a rocket ship,"" he said of median rents. ""It is just creeping higher and every so often it creeps high enough to reach a new high."" The opposite of rising rents is not necessarily falling rents, it is stabilizing rents, Miller said. The price for new rentals has been bobbing along, not going way up or way down.  ""It is part of a long process since the summer. There was expectation that rents would fall and that didn't happen. Rents peaked last summer. Every month since then, they've been moving sideways,"" he said. ""With a modest increase, it was just enough to set a new record."" A main driver for rents remaining strong in Manhattan in March is that mortgage rates have doubled from a year ago, making purchasing a home unaffordable for many buyers. In addition, the failure of some banks in March created uncertainty that may have encouraged some people considering buying to rent instead, pushing the prices higher, said Miller. New leases in March were up 15.4% from last year, according to the report, and leasing activity jumped 20.5% from February. ""The drive in more leasing activity is parallel in the rise in mortgage rates that has continued to push people into the rental market,"" said Miller. ""Not just the unaffordability, but also the uncertainty."" Listing inventory for rentals in Manhattan was near record lows a year ago and has been climbing higher. Inventory was up 40.5%, year over year, which enabled more leasing activity.  Even though inventory rose significantly, it is about 10% below long-term norms, Miller said. Some renters appear to expect prices to climb, since more than half of renters in March opted for a two-year lease, rather than a one-year lease, said Miller.  ""If you look at market share of two-year leases, 56.3%, that is the highest since June of 2021 during the rocket ship of rental activity,"" said Miller. ""What that says to me is that the consumer expects rents to rise going forward and they are locking in rent now as a protection."" Renters may be on to something there, and can likely expect more highs ahead. ""We're entering prime leasing season in an already tight market and seasonal pressure may force new records to occur,"" Miller said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a few months where we see more record highs.""

The group also includes Mitchell Rales, the billionaire co-founder of conglomerate Danaher, the source said. The NFL, the Commanders, and Harris's office would not comment on the matter. News of the near deal was first reported by Sportico, which reported the team sold for $6 billion, a record for a North American sports franchise. The current record of $4.65 billion for the purchase of the NFL's Denver Broncos was set just last year. Snyder purchased the team, then named the Washington Redskins for a reported $750 million in 1999. The team dropped its previous name in 2020 in the face of prolonged criticism. It adopted the Commanders name last year, after playing two seasons with the name Washington Football Team. Forbes had previously estimated the value of the Commanders at $5.6 billion, making it the sixth most valuable football team, after the Dallas Cowboys, the New England Patriots, the Los Angeles Rams, the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears. The only franchises from other sports worth more than that $5.6 billion estimated value are the New York Yankees and New York Knicks.  The reported rise in value for the team to $6 billion would represent about a 9% annual return on the original purchase price. Harris, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, already owns the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and co-owns the NHL's New Jersey Devils. The Harris-led group officially placed a bid on the Commanders in late March, CNN previously reported. Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers superstar, joined the group last month. Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos placed a separate $6 billion bid to buy the Commanders last month as well, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNN. Snyder said last year that he is considering a sale of the team. At the time, Snyder and his wife, Tanya, announced that they hired Bank of America Securities ""to consider potential transactions."" The decision to seek a buyer came after DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced a lawsuit against Snyder, the team and the NFL, alleging they colluded to deceive DC residents about an NFL investigation into the team's toxic workplace culture and allegations of sexual assault. The lawsuit alleges those deceptive efforts aimed to keep fans in the dark and increase profits for the team. The lawsuit cites the District of Columbia's Consumer Protection Procedures Act, which gives the Attorney General broad authority to hold individuals or a company accountable for misleading customers. Racine subsequently filed another suit for allegedly cheating ticket holders out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The complaint alleges that Pro Football Inc., the Snyder-led official owner of the Commanders, implemented a ""decades-long unlawful scheme"" to withhold hundreds of thousands of dollars in security deposits fans paid for season tickets and ""converted that money into revenue for the Team, to use for its own purposes."" In June of 2022, the House Oversight Committee also accused Snyder of fostering a ""toxic workplace"" and conducting ""a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL's own internal review."" And an internal investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson in 2021 resulted in the NFL fining the Commanders $10 million and Snyder handing control of the franchise's daily operations to his wife. Snyder has denied the allegations. News of a possible sale was cheered by some of Snyder's accusers Thursday. ""Today marks the end of a long, difficult chapter for all employees and fans of the Washington football organization,"" read a statement from Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, two attorneys representing more than 40 former Washington Commanders employees. ""We are proud of our many clients who made this moment possible -- the brave women and men who came forward repeatedly and at great personal risk to expose the decades of sexual harassment and financial wrongdoing at the team.  Their determination and perseverance forced this sale to happen.""   ""We want to welcome the new owners and hope a new chapter can truly begin at the organization. We expect that the NFL now understands that such an abusive workplace for women is unacceptable,"" the statement continued. ""The NFL must be more vigilant and must ensure that owners are held to the same standards as all employers; sexual harassment is illegal and must not be tolerated."" -- CNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report

                      Fort Lauderdale airport to remain closed until Friday morning after the rainiest day in the city's history causes severe flooding

                    ","
                      Fort Lauderdale experienced the rainiest day in its history Wednesday -- a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event -- sparking a flash flood emergency in Broward County that has prompted emergency rescues, forced drivers to abandon cars, shuttered schools and shut down the airport through 5 a.m. Friday. And more rain is on the way. The region recorded widespread rainfall totals of more than a foot, while Fort Lauderdale tallied 25.91 inches in a 24-hour period, according to preliminary reports from the National Weather Service office in Miami. Two weak tornadoes also hit Broward County Wednesday, one just west of Hollywood and another south of the Fort Lauderdale airport, according to the Miami National Weather Service. Both were short-lived and rated EF-0, the weakest category.  While the rain Thursday won't reach nearly the amounts that fell on Wednesday, it will be problematic and create additional flooding, the National Weather Service said. Gusty winds, small hail and even isolated tornadoes are possible.  A flood warning for Broward County is in effect until 7:30 p.m., the National Weather Service said, and a severe thunderstorm warning is in effect for parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties. The storms may bring winds of up to 60 mph and potentially small hail.  Thunderstorms are beginning to develop across southeastern Florida and will once again bring a risk of flash flooding to the region. ""Isolated instances of flash flooding are likely this afternoon with locally heavy rainfall capable of 1-3 inch per hour rates,"" according to the Weather Prediction Center. ""This may lead to additional localized rainfall totals of 3-5+ inches, which could possibly aggravate ongoing flooding conditions across the highly sensitive Fort Lauderdale region."" While conditions are similar to Wednesday, favoring heavy rainfall, the prediction center stated that there are significant differences from yesterday that should limit the prolonged occurrence of very heavy rainfall rates. Between 14 and 20 inches of rain have drenched the greater Fort Lauderdale metro area since Wednesday afternoon, according to a Thursday morning update from the National Weather Service office in Miami. The deluge is the ""most severe flooding that I've ever seen,"" one mayor said. ""This amount of rain in a 24-hour period is incredibly rare for South Florida,"" said meteorologist Ana Torres-Vazquez from the weather service's Miami forecast office.  Rainfall of 20 to 25 inches is similar to what the area can receive with a high-end hurricane over more than a day, Torres-Vazquez explained. She described the rainfall as a ""1-in-1,000 year event, or greater,"" meaning it's an event so intense, the chance of it happening in any given year is just 0.1%. During the peak of Wednesday's deluge, a month's worth of rain fell in just one hour. Fort Lauderdale's average rainfall for April is 3 inches and it's been nearly 25 years since the city totaled 20 inches of rain in an entire month. Extreme rainfall is a signature consequence of a warming climate, and it is happening more frequently. The deluge in South Florida is just the latest instance after 1-in-1000 year rains struck over the past year in areas including Dallas, St. Louis, eastern Kentucky and Yellowstone. ""Even though the heavy rain has concluded, numerous roads remain closed,"" the weather service said, adding that flooding is expected to persist.  Earlier, Fort Lauderdale was ""experiencing severe flooding in multiple areas of the city,"" Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue said on social media, warning to stay off the roads as vehicles may become stuck or submerged.   A flash flood emergency -- the highest level of flood warning -- that was in effect for portions of South Florida, including Fort Lauderdale, expired early Thursday.  City crews in Hollywood, Florida, ""are doing everything they can"" to deploy pumps wherever possible and keep drains clear, Mayor Josh Levy told CNN. ""We've recorded over 12 inches of rain since midnight, and that's on top of consecutive days of seemingly nonstop rain,"" Levy said. ""The ground was already saturated so there is extensive flooding all over our city and throughout South Florida. Many roadways are impassable. Lots of vehicles got stuck and left abandoned in the middle of our roadways.   ""I've lived here my whole life. This is the most severe flooding that I've ever seen,"" he said.   Several state agencies and emergency resources are assisting with the flood situation, according to a news release from Gov. Ron DeSantis.  More rain and storms expected Thursday South Florida could get inundated with more even rain as showers and strong storms are in the forecast Thursday. ""After a historic day of rainfall across portions of South Florida that many of us will not soon forget, another potential wet day is ahead for today,"" the weather service in Miami said. There is a slight risk, Level 2 of 5, for severe storms Thursday in parts of Florida, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Jacksonville, according to the Storm Prediction Center. In Fort Lauderdale, airboats and high-clearance buggies have been secured from the county sheriff's office and the Florida Wildlife Commission as officials activated their emergency operations center and will issue a proclamation of a local state of emergency, they said in a statement early Thursday. Emergency crews worked continuously overnight responding to rescue calls across South Florida, Fort Lauderdale city officials said. ""City Hall remains closed. The ground floor is flooded, and staff is working to restore power to the building,"" said a Thursday morning update.   City officials are asking neighbors to be patient as ""flooding conditions remain impactful in the southern areas of the City this morning,"" officials said. ""We expect the flooding to subside through the next hours and have seen improvements in certain areas of downtown."" Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue crews received over 900 calls for service during overnight flooding, according to Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis. The Broward Sheriff's Office assisted the agency in 300 rescue calls received during the historic flooding event, according to the mayor. ""There is not one area of this city that has not been impacted,"" Trantalis said. Officials had asked residents to avoid driving or traveling in Fort Lauderdale amid the storms. ""Public Works staff are clearing drains and operating pumps to mitigate the water as quickly as possible. Efforts have been made to relieve traffic congestion through prioritized signaling to assist individuals leaving the City. We are requesting drivers to stay off the roads and avoid the City of Fort Lauderdale until the water has subsided,"" the city of Fort Lauderdale said in a news release on Wednesday evening. ""Because of the extreme amount of water, most areas will need to drain naturally,"" Trantalis said. ""Crews are out in neighborhoods clearing storm drains to aid water receding from neighborhoods. Vacuum trucks are being deployed strategically throughout the city.""  The Florida Highway Patrol has closed several exits on Interstate 95 in Fort Lauderdale, the city's fire department said. In Coral Gables in Miami-Dade County, officials are working on two water main breaks, according to the Coral Gables Police Department. Some roads in the city are shut down due to the flooding, while others have limited travel, police said, noting residents should give themselves extra time to commute to work. The Broward Sheriff's Office said in a statement Wednesday it is ""being inundated with non-emergency 911 calls regarding the inclement weather"" and asks residents to use 911 only for ""true emergencies,"" also telling residents to avoid driving and to call a tow truck company if a vehicle is stranded and not in an emergency.  Some local services are shuttering Thursday. The Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is closed due to ongoing flooding in the vicinity and will reopen at noon, according to an update from the airport. The airport's departure level reopened to allow people to exit the area, the airport said early Thursday morning.  The Brightline train service has been temporarily suspended between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, the service said on social media.  Additionally, Broward County Public Schools announced the district will be closed Thursday.  ""No city could have planned for this,"" Trantalis said.  Trantalis says he has spoken to the White House and Senator Marco Rubio about the situation. The mayor said Gov. ""DeSantis has not yet called but I'm sure he is very interested in what's going on here.""  Trapped by floodwaters Mandi-Lynn Guertin flew into Fort Lauderdale with her friends for a three-day country music festival that starts Friday. The group flew in from Connecticut and had never experienced weather like this, Guertin told CNN. The car they rented got stuck in about 3 feet of water, died and water quickly filled the inside, so they had to leave it on the side of the road.  ""We currently can't leave our Airbnb because the flood waters are too high and no Ubers will come out to get us,"" Guertin said. Guertin and her friends work in emergency services back home but Wednesday night, the quick nature of the flooding really scared them, she said. ""Southern hospitality and helping your 'neighbors' is truly a thing down here and I could not be more thankful today,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""So many strangers did so much for us tonight."" For now, the group plans to wait it out at their Airbnb, without much of a choice and hope that enough water recedes so they can attend the music festival tomorrow, which has not been canceled yet. Rock The Ocean's Tortuga Music Festival, the oceanside festival, will ""move forward"" as planned, despite flood conditions in the city, according to event organizers. Dawn Grayson lives 20 minutes from Fort Lauderdale -- Hollywood International Airport and also got stuck on her way home Wednesday when torrential rain flooded the airport and surrounding roads.  Grayson was stuck in her car for several hours while she waited for flood waters to subside, she told CNN. ""The parking garages were flooding, and vehicles got stuck,"" Grayson said. ""We were stuck in our vehicle for 5 hours on the terminal road.""

                      Russia's war in Ukraine

                      One-third of Ukraine's territory ""is potentially contaminated with explosive devices,"" a spokesperson for the country's State Emergency Service said in a statement Thursday.  The regions with the most potential danger are Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine, Donetsk in the east, and Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, according to Oleksandr Khorunzhyi, SES spokesperson. Khorunzhyi said the service's pyrotechnic units are working to defuse and clear the explosives, having already removed more than 316,000 remnants of war since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. The official said crews are taking particular care to remove mines around energy infrastructure. Some context: The area described by Khorunzhyi — one-third of Ukraine's territory — amounts to about 174,000 square kilometers (over 67,000 square miles). The European Union added Russia’s Wagner private military group and Russian news agency RIA FAN to a list of organizations it is sanctioning, a statement from the European Council said Thursday. The EU sanctioned the two organizations for ""undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,"" the statement read.  “Russia must stop its aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces and proxies from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” the statement read.
            “The EU stands firmly and fully with Ukraine and will continue to provide strong political, economic, military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes.” Some background: RIA FAN is part of the Patriot Media Group, a Russian organization whose Board of Trustees is headed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to the EU. Prigozhin is also the head of the Wagner Group, which has been previously sanctioned for what the EU describes as serious human rights violations. The EU has now sanctioned a total of 1,473 individuals and 207 entities in connection with their actions in Ukraine, the statement read. Those designated are subject to an asset freeze and EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to them, the statement read. Authorities will bolster security measures across the country as Ukrainians prepare to celebrate another Orthodox Easter while fighting Russia's war.  Residents are discouraged from attending church services late at night this weekend, and many cemeteries will remain closed due to the danger of unexploded mines and Russian shelling. Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate Palm Sunday and Easter one week after many Christians in the US and other Western countries observe the holiday. Ukrainian officials have warned in the past that Russian attacks may increase around specific dates, holidays or events. Oleksiy Biloshytskyi, a national law enforcement official, said police will use special monitoring centers to look out for any signs of attacks. ""We must remember that the enemy is insidious and can take any action even during this (Easter) night,"" he said. In the capital Kyiv, residents will be able to attend late evening church services despite a curfew, but they must arrive at church before the curfew takes effect, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, Serhii Popko, said Thursday in a Telegram post. Popko said churchgoers and clergy should research the nearest shelter to their congregation and be prepared to flee to safety if an air raid alarm sounds. The curfew hours in Kyiv last from midnight to 5 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), as is the case for most of the country. In the broader Kyiv region, residents will only be able to attend church services when the curfew is not in effect, and only a limited number of people will be allowed on the grounds of churches and cemeteries due to security reasons, the Kyiv region's military administration said Monday.  Many churches will broadcast services online, it added. In northeastern Kharkiv, which is Ukraine's second-largest city, officials will close a number of cemeteries. Authorities warned that one of the cemeteries, the Slobozhanskyi memorial complex, has not been fully cleared of explosive mines. Other city cemeteries will be closed on Easter ""to avoid provocations by the enemy and to protect citizens from unpredictable missile attacks,"" the city council said. In the southern city of Kherson, residents won't be able to visit cemeteries or attend church services during curfew hours, the city council said Tuesday. It said the ban on cemeteries was due to mine danger. ""The enemy daily launches hostile attacks on the civilian population of the Kherson community. Unfortunately, the possibility of shelling during the holidays cannot be ruled out,"" the city council said.  Russia's Foreign Ministry will only discuss a potential exchange for jailed American journalist Evan Gershkovich after his trial, according to Russian state news agency TASS.  ""The issue of exchanging anyone can be considered after the court issues its verdict specifically on this charge,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Thursday, according to TASS. “As for the exchange, then we have a special channel for this, the special services are engaged in this, and they will continue to deal with this issue."" Ryabkov accused The Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich's employer, of trying ""to escalate on this topic day by day."" The newspaper and other news organizations have been united in calling for the release of Gershkovich, who the US has designated as wrongfully detained.  Gershkovich has been detained on espionage charges, which he denies, and currently awaits trial in the notorious Lefortovo detention prison. US President Joe Biden touted Western support for the defense of Ukraine during a speech to Ireland's parliament Thursday, prompting an ovation from the assembled lawmakers. ""Ireland and the United States are standing together to oppose Russia's brutal aggression and support the brave people of Ukraine,"" the American leader said. Biden praised Ireland's support for Kyiv, saying it had provided tens of millions of dollars worth of non-lethal aid over the past year. He also thanked the country for its ""vital leadership"" on the United Nations Security Council, where Irish leaders collaborated with the US to ensure UN sanctions wouldn't interfere with humanitarian work, according to the president. The US leader said such collaboration between Western nations proves that Russian President Vladimir Putin underestimated the unified response to his invasion of Ukraine. ""Putin thought the world would look the other way — was confident he would break NATO and the European Union,"" Biden said. ""The unity of Western nations would fracture and fall at the moment of testing: That's what he thought. But he was wrong. He was wrong on every point and every front. Today, we're more united and more determined than ever to defend the values that make us strong."" Germany on Thursday granted permission for Poland to re-export five old German MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the German Ministry of Defense said in a statement. ""I am pleased to inform you that we can promise our Polish partners the delivery of five MiG-29s from former NVA (National People's Army) stocks to Ukraine,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in the statement. “We only received the application today. I welcome the fact that we in the Federal Government have reached this decision together. This shows that Germany can be relied upon!""  In March, Poland pledged it would send four MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the first NATO member to do so. Polish President Andrzej Duda said the planes — about a dozen that the country had inherited from the former German Democratic Republic — would be handed over in the coming days after being serviced. “When it comes to the MiG-29 aircraft, which are still operating in the defense of Polish airspace, a decision has been taken at the highest levels, we can say confidently that we are sending MiGs to Ukraine,” Duda said.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' office said he’s ""not surprised"" that he is being spied on, following alleged US intelligence revelations.  His comments come after a BBC report Thursday on a US intelligence leak that accused Guterres of being too soft on Russia. According to the broadcaster, the documents in the leak also detailed private conversations involving Guterres and his staff.      “The Secretary-General has been at this job, and in the public eye, for a long time. He’s not surprised by the fact that people are spying on him and listening in on his private conversations,” Guterres’ office said in a statement Thursday.  “What is surprising is the malfeasance or incompetence that allows for such private conversations to be distorted and become public,” it added. Later on Thursday, Guterres' spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric responded, saying that ""the secretary-general is not soft on any one country."" The BBC report is the latest revelation in an online leak of classified US government documents. It includes detail of a private conversation between Guterres and his deputy Amina Mohammed. It also sheds light on how Washington perceived Guterres’ handling of the Black Sea grain deal, which was brokered by the UN and Turkey, according to the BBC. It suggests US officials believe Guterres was so keen to maintain the deal that he made generous concessions to Russia back in February. CNN has not independently verified the documents. ""Guterres emphasized his efforts to improve Russia's ability to export,"" the leaked documents reportedly say, ""even if that involves sanctioned Russian entities or individuals."" A US State department spokesperson responded Thursday, saying that the documents are being assessed for validity and ""we are not in a position to confirm or comment on any specific information they contain."" ##Pentagon Docs## Russian shelling in the southern Kherson region killed at least two civilians Thursday, a regional official said, as authorities prepare to implement additional safety measures for the Orthodox Easter holiday.  A 45-year-old man died in the city of Kherson from wounds he sustained after Russian forces shelled a park, Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson regional military administration, said on national television Thursday.  Another civilian died in the village of Zmiivka, when ""the Russians hit the building of a local school with guided aerial bombs,"" Prokudin said.  ""Today the enemy aviation stuck Zmiivka village of Beryslav district. The Russians hit the building of a local school with guided aerial bombs. According to preliminary information, one person was killed and another was wounded,"" Prokudin said. On Wednesday, Russian forces attacked the liberated territories in the Kherson region 46 times, he said. Kherson city was shelled five times, he added.  Prokudin also commented on safety measures ahead of the Orthodox Easter holiday this weekend.  ""We have no right to put people in danger, so the Kherson region security council took a few important decisions to make the Easter holidays safe,"" he said.  As part of the measures, during the curfew hours from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time —residents won't be allowed to visit churches and cemeteries, Prokudin said. ""These are the forced measures which have to be taken due to mines danger on the graveyard and a high possibility of Russian strikes,"" he said. ""I ask the residents to treat these rules with understanding and follow them, because this is for your own safety."" About 60,000 people remain in Kherson city at the moment, which is about 20% of the city's pre-war population, Prokudin said.  A Russian court has placed under house arrest a man suspected of involvement in the St. Petersburg bombing that killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, according to a statement by the court and state media.  The Leninsky District Court of St. Petersburg said it has ""granted the investigation's petition and announced its decision to impose house arrest as a measure of restraint against Dmitry Kasintsev, who is accused of committing a crime under Article 205.6 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation."" The crime listed in the referenced Criminal Code article is ""failure to report a crime."" ""The court proceedings were held behind closed doors. The investigator submitted a substantiated and motivated petition along with supporting materials in this regard,"" according to the court statement released Thursday. The statement didn't provide additional details.   Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday that Kasintsev allegedly ""hid"" Daria Trepova in his apartment after the explosion in a cafe on the Universitetskaya embankment in St. Petersburg, quoting media reports. More background: Russian authorities detained Trepova, a 26-year-old anti-war protester, on April 3, claiming she was involved in the blast that killed the well-known military blogger. Trepova’s husband, Dmitry Rylov, has told an independent Russian publication that he is convinced she was set up. Previously, Kasintsev was involved in the case as a witness, according to TASS.  First lady Jill Biden penned an essay honoring her Ukrainian counterpart Olena Zelenska as one of TIME magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2023. Biden called Zelenska — a screenwriter who married Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2003, when he was still working as an actor and comedian — a “warrior” and the “pride of her nation.” “A writer who worked behind the scenes, she never asked for a spotlight. A mother of two, she never asked to become the heart of a nation at war. Olena Zelenska didn’t expect to become a warrior for the people of Ukraine, but she has answered this call with selfless courage,” Biden wrote.  Biden reflected on her Mother’s Day 2022 meeting with Zelenska during an unannounced trip to Ukraine. “In the strain of her smile, I could see the weight she carried: the sleep lost to the percussion of falling bombs, the tales of atrocities that she would never forget. In her eyes, however, was the fierce determination and dignity that has defined her people,” Biden wrote.  Biden said Zelenska’s decision to stay in her country, despite the danger she faces, shows the world “heart and hope can make even the largest tyrant seem small.” The first lady also welcomed Zelenska to the White House last July, where the two had a conversation on mental health and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  A 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman has been identified by The New York Times as the leader of an online gaming chat group where a trove of classified documents — which contain information about the war in Ukraine — was posted.  The Times reported Thursday that FBI investigators want to talk to the service member and believe he has information relevant to the ongoing investigation into the leak. CNN has not independently verified the identity of the chat leader or the FBI’s interest in talking with him.  Earlier Thursday, President Joe Biden appeared to suggest that the US government is close to identifying the leaker. CNN has previously reported that the Army Criminal Investigation Division is also “assisting the DoD in their investigation” of the leak, Jeffrey Castro, a spokesman for the division, told CNN. On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported that the person behind the leak worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. ##Pentagon Docs## The European Union will establish a 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) fund to reimburse member states for ammunition donated to Ukraine, according to the Council of the EU’s website. The decision, approved Thursday, is part of the alliance's efforts to speed up the procurement and delivery of artillery ammunition, which Ukraine is burning through rapidly in its defense against Russia’s invasion. The measure covers existing stocks and ammunition reprioritized from existing orders between February 9 and May 31, 2023, according to the council. The fund is the first step in a program agreed to by EU capitals on March 20. “There is no better demonstration of the EU’s united resolve and determination to continue supporting Ukraine’s legitimate right of self-defence against the brutal Russian aggressor,” Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, is quoted as saying in a news release. The FBI has narrowed the number of people who they believe could be responsible for leaks of classified US documents and have been conducting interviews in recent days, two people briefed on the matter said.  While there is a large number of people who had access to the documents, investigators have been able to home in on a small number for closer scrutiny, thanks to the forensic trail left by the person who posted the documents. Investigators are working on building a case for prosecution, the people familiar with the matter say.  The FBI believes they are close to identifying the person behind the leak. The leaked documents posted to social media, some of which have been obtained by CNN, include detailed intelligence assessments of allies and adversaries alike, including on the state of the war in Ukraine and the challenges both Kyiv and Moscow face as the conflict appears stuck in a stalemate in the months ahead. Another source familiar with the criminal investigation at this point said that they expect it’ll move along much more quickly than the Pentagon’s damage assessment. The source also said that the FBI is getting closer to identifying a suspect. CNN has previously reported that the Army Criminal Investigation Division is also ""assisting the DoD in their investigation"" of the leak, according to Jeffrey Castro, a spokesperson for the division. It is unclear if the alleged leaker works within the US Army.  The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the person behind the massive leak of classified US military documents worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. CNN has not been able to independently verify the reporting.  ##Pentagon Docs##  President Joe Biden appeared to suggest Thursday the US government is close to identifying the leaker responsible for the disclosure of sensitive US government secrets. ""There’s a full-blown investigation going on as you know,"" Biden said when asked for comment about the leaks while speaking in Dublin, where he is meeting the Irish president. ""The intelligence community and the Justice Department. And they’re getting close. I don’t have an answer for you."" It was Biden's first time commenting about the leak situation. The US president said he was concerned the leak happened, but not necessarily worried about its content. ""I’m not concerned about the leak. I’m concerned that it happened, but there’s nothing contemporaneous that I’m aware of that is of any consequence,"" he told reporters.  Biden's comments come as The Washington Post reported Wednesday that the person behind a massive leak of classified US military documents worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. The Post reporting, which CNN could not independently verify, covers new ground in identifying the supposed leaker of highly classified documents – including some that paint a pessimistic US view of the war in Ukraine – and provides the first known details about who may be behind a major national security breach that has rocked Washington in recent days. CNN's Zachary Cohen and Sean Lyngaas contributed reporting to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs##  The fiercest and heaviest fighting continues in the embattled eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Thursday. At a news conference in Kyiv, Maliar said, “Despite the fact that the enemy has concentrated its most professional units in Bakhmut, including Wagner fighters, airborne assault units, and special forces, the Russians cannot achieve their goals there, i.e. take full control of Bakhmut. “As of today, the Russians are suffering huge losses there, and despite these losses, they are not stopping and still want to achieve their goal of taking control of the city.” Recent social media videos geolocated by CNN show how buildings have been flattened to ruins in the beleaguered city, while drone footage posted Wednesday by Russian state media RIA Novosti reveals the scale of the decimation wreaked by the months-long battle.  Oleksii Hromov, deputy chief of the General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said the Bakhmut area remains the most difficult and “the enemy continues offensive actions in the central part of Bakhmut, as well as in the directions of Bohdanivka and Ivanivske to surround the city from the north and south."" “In order to strengthen the offensive potential, some of the enemy's forces and means were moved to the Bakhmut area from the Avdiivka direction,” he said. “Every day in the area of Bakhmut, the enemy makes 40 to 50 attempts at offensive assaults, conducting more than 500 attacks using the full range of available weapons. “At the same time, the military and political leadership of the Russian Federation does not take into account the losses of personnel. For example, in the last two weeks alone, the enemy has lost nearly 4,500 Wagner fighters and regular Russian Armed Forces servicemen killed and wounded in the area of Bakhmut,” Hromov added. CNN cannot independently verify Ukraine’s battlefield claims of Russian losses. Both sides claim the other has suffered huge losses.  The founder and head of the Wagner private military company, Yevgeny Prigozhin, last month said Bakhmut ""has already practically destroyed the Ukrainian army,"" adding that ""unfortunately"" Wagner has ""been pretty battered"" as well. Some background: The city of Bakhmut sits towards the northeast of the Donetsk region, about 13 miles from Luhansk region, and has been a target for Russian forces for months. Since last summer the city has been a stone's throw from the front lines, so its capture would represent a long sought-after success for Moscow's forces — and bring some limited strategic value. The city has important road connections to other parts of the Donetsk region; eastwards to the border with Luhansk, north-west to Sloviansk and south-west to Kostiantynivka. CNN's Rob Picheta contributed to this post.  Russian forces have carried out a wave of strikes against Ukraine, and continue to focus their offensive efforts on the country's eastern Donetsk region. Elsewhere, a Russian mine has exploded at the Zaporizhizhia nuclear plant, and Ukraine is celebrating the one-year anniversary of when it says it sank Russia's Moskva warship.  Here are the latest headlines: Russia steps up strikes: In the past day, Russia has launched two missiles and 32 air strikes, as well as more than 40 rounds from multiple launch rocket systems, according to the Ukrainian military's General Staff. Moscow continues to focus its main efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka areas, it added.

            Kremlin doubts reports of infighting: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he doubts the “reliability” of reports of broad infighting between Russian officials, including some within the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry. The New York Times has reported that new batch of classified US intelligence documents revealed divisions among Russian officials.
            Blogger killer's alleged accomplice named: Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has named an alleged accomplice in the attack on pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, who was killed in the St. Petersburg cafe blast on April 2. Ukrainian citizen Yuriy Denisov was involved in the preparation for what was later classified as a terrorist attack, it said.
            Ukraine's foreign minister wants borders restored: Real peace will only be achieved in Ukraine by restoring the country's borders and it taking back Crimea, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Thursday. “Real peace means restoring the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine,"" he said.
            One year anniversary of ""Moskva"" sinking: Thursday marks one year since Ukraine says it struck the Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea, causing it to sink the next day. 
            Russian man deported from Belarus: A Russian father who was accused of discrediting the Russian army after his daughter’s anti-war drawing caught the eye of authorities has been extradited to Russia from Belarus, state media reported. 
            Wagner chief denies involvement in Ukrainian POW execution: Russian Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin denied allegations his private military organization was responsible for the apparent execution of a captured Ukrainian soldier who had been beheaded in a grisly video. ""It is “complete rubbish” and “doesn't match reality,"" Prigozhin said.  ##Catch Up## Norway has expelled more than a dozen employees of the Russian embassy in Oslo Thursday who it says are working as intelligence agents for Moscow.  The move comes in response to an increasing intelligence threat from Moscow and a “deteriorating security situation” in Europe, according to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  It said it had been monitoring the 15 embassy workers and have found them to be “engaging in activities that are not compatible with their diplomatic status.”  They have been declared to be personae non gratae, stripped of diplomatic immunity, and must leave the country “shortly,” the ministry said in a statement.  The expulsion comes amid wider security concerns among European countries following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  “Russia currently poses the greatest intelligence threat to Norway. We take this very seriously, and are now implementing measures to counter Russian intelligence activities in our country,” Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said.  The decision comes a year after the expulsion of three Russian intelligence officers who were also working under diplomatic cover in Oslo. “I would like to emphasize that Norway is seeking to maintain normal diplomatic relations with Russia, and that Russian diplomats are welcome in Norway,” Huitfeldt said. But Norway will not accept that diplomatic missions are “misused for the purposes of carrying out covert intelligence activities,"" she added. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office said Thursday it has launched an investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a captured Ukrainian solider. “In the course of monitoring the Internet, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation has found photographic and video materials containing, presumably, scenes of the murder of an allegedly Ukrainian serviceman,” an official statement reads. The statement specifies the probe is related to video of ""an unknown person in camouflage in the summer season"" that ""uses violence with a knife against an unknown serviceman, as a result of which he causes his death"". The Prosecution has submitted the materials to investigating authorities for probing in order to “assess the authenticity of these materials and make an appropriate decision.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he doubts the “reliability” of reports of broad infighting between Russian officials. “I don’t know what these reports (of infighting) are based on, but I’m doubting their reliability and the author’s understanding of the essence of what is happening inside Russia,"" said in response to a CNN question about a New York Times report on a new batch of classified US intelligence documents. The NYT says the documents, which it reports were posted on a Discord server, show infighting between the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry over Russia’s casualty count for the war in Ukraine.  Peskov was also asked specifically about a reported meeting on February 22 between Russian President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, likely to resolve a public dispute over ammunition supply. “I know nothing about it,"" he said. An additional online leak of classified US intelligence documents suggests broad infighting between Russian officials, including some within the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Defense Ministry, the New York Times reported Thursday.  CNN has not independently verified the documents. The NYT said it had shown the new 27-pages of documents to multiple US officials, who did not dispute the information but “could not, and would not, independently verify the documents”. CNN has contacted the Pentagon for comment. The United States has said that the first set of documents released last week were authentic, but has said that some of the documents were not legitimate and had been altered.  The NYT says the documents, which it reports were posted on a Discord server, show infighting between the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry over Russia’s casualty count for the war in Ukraine.  The new documents also indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin called Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to a meeting believed to have taken place on February 22 to likely resolve a public dispute over ammunition supply, the NYT reports.  Prigozhin had accused Russia’s defense establishment of creating “major problems” with ammunition supplies for his troops.  He went as far as accusing the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry of “treason” for failing to get ammunition to Wagner fighters and “also not helping with air transport.” On February 23, CNN reported Prigozhin said that a shipment of ammunition was now on its way to his fighters, in a message and voice note published on his Telegram channel. The NYT report says the documents detail US monitoring of Russian intelligence and apparatus and military command.  ##Pentagon Docs## A Russian mine has exploded near the engine room of a reactor at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), according to Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom. ""The Russian occupiers continue to turn Zaporizhzhia NPP into a military base by mining the perimeter around the plant. And these actions cannot but have consequences,"" the company said in a statement on Thursday.  ""Europe's largest nuclear facility continues to suffer from the arbitrariness of the Russian military and their henchmen, while Ukrainian personnel are desperately trying to maintain nuclear and radiation safety across the continent,"" the statement continues. The plant sits in the Russian-occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region. It has been held by Russian forces for some 12 months but is operated by its Ukrainian staff. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of threatening nuclear terrorism, particularly around the plant.  On March 29, Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has been working to make the plant safe, said he was ""working with management in both Kyiv and Moscow to implement measures to protect the plant."" European countries have condemned Russia after a video purporting to show a Ukrainian soldier being beheaded emerged online.   Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra tweeted that he is “deeply appalled” by the alleged beheading, calling it a “vile, barbaric act and a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions.”  Such evil only strengthens our determination to support Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression,"" Hoekstra added.  And Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson tweeted that Sweden will work to find the perpetrators. “Sweden will do all in our power, also during our Presidency of the Council of the EU, to ensure that the perpetrators of the atrocities committed during Russia's aggression in Ukraine will be held to account,” Kristersson’s government account tweeted.   “We will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.” Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has named an alleged accomplice in the attack on pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, who was killed in the St. Petersburg cafe blast on April 2. Ukrainian citizen Yuriy Denisov was involved in the preparation for what was later classified as a terrorist attack in the cafe that killed the blogger and injured over 50 people, according to the FSB statement. Denisov allegedly passed the figurine with an explosive device to 26-year-old anti-war protester Daria Trepova, who was later arrested and charged with terrorism in connection with Tatarsky’s death. CNN is not able to independently verify the claims. “It was established that the murder of M. Fomin [Vladlen Tatarsky’s real name], together with D. Trepova, was prepared by a member of the Ukrainian sabotage and terrorist group, citizen of Ukraine Yuriy Denisov, born in 1987, who, through the ‘express delivery’ service via an intermediary, transferred an explosive device to her in Moscow, camouflaged as a plaster figurine of the military reporter,"" reads the statement. The FSB said it believes Denisov came to Russia from Kyiv via Latvia “on the instructions of the Ukrainian special services” to collect information about the blogger. Denisov left Russia the day after the explosion, the statement added. Tatarsky was one of Russia’s most outspoken and ultranationalist military bloggers, known for his ardent pro-war commentary and occasional criticism of Moscow’s battlefield failures. What Ukraine says: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told CNN on Thursday that it won't comment on the allegations. ""The Security Service of Ukraine will not comment on any cases of sporadic explosions, reckless smoking and driving of collaborators till Ukrainian victory in the war,"" the SBU said.  CNN's Victoria Butenko in Kyiv contributed reporting to this post.  Real peace will only be achieved in Ukraine by restoring the country's borders and it taking back Crimea, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Thursday. “Real peace means restoring the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Real peace means a safe homeland for the targeted people in the Ukrainian Crimea,” Kuleba said via video link in an address to the Black Sea Security Conference in Bucharest. “Real peace means grain ships in the Black Sea, not warships. The world under the rule of international law, rather than force is what real peace means. That is what we're fighting for,” Kuleba added. “If Russia keeps Crimea once it has revealed its strengths, it will use it as a launchpad to invade Ukraine once again and take full control of the Black Sea. We will not allow this to happen. This is why we will liberate every inch of our territory and every last one of our fellow citizens,” the Ukrainian minister said. “And that is why we are today calling for a demilitarization of the Black Sea so that peaceful law-abiding countries can once again use the shared sea to trade travel and live freely without fear of Russian warships,” Kuleba added. Kuleba reiterated the impact of Russia’s aggression, saying it has left “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe,” while adding it was time to turn the Black Sea into “a sea of NATO.” What Moscow says: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded to Kuleba’s statement, saying that “the Black Sea will never be a NATO sea."" “This is a common sea for all coastal states. It should be a sea of cooperation, interaction, and security,"" Peskov said on a regular conference call.  CNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this post.  Thursday marks one year since Ukraine says it struck the Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea, causing it to sink the next day. Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov commemorated the anniversary on Facebook. “Remember the mood a year ago. The event was so inspiring and unbelievable at the same time that many thought it couldn't be true. After all, the last time Russia lost its flagship was more than a century ago,” he wrote. “Our soldiers did the seemingly impossible. And it changed the course of history. Because a chain reaction began. It was the last day of the Russian fleet's dominance in the Black Sea.” Ukraine said it hit the Moskva with anti-ship cruise missiles and that these sparked a fire that detonated the ammunition.  It was the biggest wartime loss of a naval ship in 40 years.  Russia put out its own version of events: Russia’s Defense Ministry says a fire of unknown origin detonated the ship’s stored ammunition and the resulting explosions left the Moskva with structural damage.  It says the warship then sank amid rough seas as it was being towed to a nearby port. A Russian father who was accused of discrediting the Russian army after his daughter’s anti-war drawing caught the eye of authorities has been extradited to Russia from Belarus, state media reported. The Interior Ministry of Belarus confirmed to Russian state news agency TASS Thursday that Belarusian law enforcement agencies have handed over Alexey Moskalyov to Russia. A lawyer with the human rights organization OVD-Info, Vladimir Biliyenko, who represents Moskalyov in Russia, said that he had not been informed about the extradition of his client. According to OVD-Info, prior to extradition, Moskalyov was held in Prison No. 8 in Zhodino, Belarus. Moskalyov was sentenced to two years in prison by a Russian court at the end of March for his online posts critical of the invasion of Ukraine.  He managed to escape from house arrest on the eve of the verdict but was tracked by the authorities and detained in Belarus two days later. Read previous CNN reporting here: Russia fired two S-300 missiles at Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine overnight, Vadym Liakh, head of the city military administration, said Thursday. The first missile hit a school yard and damaged multi-story buildings nearby. The second hit near the city's water facility, Liakh said. No casualties were reported.  In the past day, Russia had launched two missiles and 32 air strikes, as well as more than 40 rounds from multiple launch rocket systems, according to a report Thursday morning from the Ukrainian military's General Staff.  The General Staff said Russia continues to focus its main efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka areas. The person behind a massive leak of classified US military documents worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. The Post reporting, which CNN could not independently verify, covers new ground in identifying the supposed leaker of highly classified documents – including some that paint a pessimistic US view of the war in Ukraine – and provides the first known details about who may be behind a major national security breach that has rocked Washington in recent days. The leaker, described in the Post story as a lonely young man and gun enthusiast, was part of a chatroom of about two dozen people on Discord – a social media platform popular with video gamers – that shared a love of guns and military gear, The Post reported, citing an interview with the leaker’s friend who was also part of the group. The friend told the Post he would not reveal the identity of the alleged leaker or their location to authorities. The leaker, going by the moniker “OG,” began posting messages to the Discord chatroom last year that referenced military jargon, The Post reported. In the months that followed, the leaker posted messages in which he appeared to transcribe classified information from US documents, according to the report.

Amid its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, it’s Russia’s turn to assume presidency of the UN Security Council – which is charged with maintaining global peace and security, and Lavrov is set to chair the UN Security Council meeting in New York this month.  ""We urge Washington not to delay issuing visas to our delegation, including our journalists. Failure to issue visas violates the obligations of the United States as the host country of the UN headquarters, hindering the proper, full functioning of the world organization,"" Antonov said, as cited by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Thursday.  Antonov also said US authorities ""have not agreed to the plane's arrival. We expect the Americans to promptly issue a permit for the aircraft (to enter US airspace) without any conditions or restrictions.” He stressed that even though the event is still days from now, there is still no certainty. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment but has not heard back. Barred entry: Last February when Russia began its war on Ukraine, the US imposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other members of Russia’s Security Council, prohibiting them from traveling to the US. Why is Russia assuming presidency of the Security Council? Presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically among its 15 member nations. The body is controlled by its five permanent members -- China, France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Earlier in April, US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield described Russia assuming the Security Council presidency as ""an April Fool's joke."" Greenfield said the council does work beyond Ukraine when she was asked whether the US would issue a visa for Lavrov or whether to attend.  ""We haven't decided yet on what our attendance levels will be, but we intend to carry out the business of the Security Council during this month,"" Greenfield said. ""The Security Council does more than Ukraine. We work on many issues, and we again expect that Russia will carry their presidency in a professional way, but when they don't, we will stand ready to call them out."" An American man from Florida died while volunteering in the fighting in Ukraine, his family tells CNN.  Parker Cummings speaking to CNN by phone that his half-brother, Edward Wilton died in Ukraine where he was a volunteer fighter. Cummings said Wilton died on April 7 and the family was told by the embassy on April 10. Wilton had been in Ukraine for nearly a year at the time of his death. Wilton felt compelled to join forces to help the Ukrainians. Cummings said that Wilton told him in a message on April 10, 2022, that he was on a plane to Ukraine. “I talked to him through Signal the app and asked him to come home all the time,” Cummings said. “He would say ‘I have to stay here with my guys and do what’s right.’” Wilton was slated to come back home in October when his contract expired, Cummings said. Wilton just turned 22 on March 23. He spent a week in Poland celebrating his birthday and visiting with his mom who traveled from Florida, Cummings said, he was also able to video chat with Wilton when he was in Poland. “They had a nice week,” he said. “Now, two weeks later here we are.” Wilton was in the US Army and previously stationed at Fort Benning in Georgia, Cummings said. In high school, Wilton played football and his favorite team was the Jacksonville Jaguars. “My brother was the most selfless person I ever met. Edward is a true hero.”
            “I want everyone to know that my brother chose to go fight for democracy, freedom and righteousness versus evil. My brother laid down his 22-year-old life in the namesake for the future of Ukraine and all his children. We will miss him dearly. We cannot wait to see him again.” A State Department spokesperson tells CNN, ""We can confirm the deaths of U.S. citizens in Ukraine,"" but did not reveal their names, out of respect for the families' privacy, adding, ""We are in touch with the families and providing all possible consular assistance."" Cummings said that Wilton’s squadron (Foreign Legion) in Ukraine held a memorial for him on Wednesday morning. The family is now waiting to find out when they can get his body back so they can plan a funeral. CNN’s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. As a NATO member, Turkey is broadly considered a partner nation to the US and other nations providing direct military support to Ukraine, and it has publicly expressed opposition to Russia's invasion. It is also home to a major US military base where nuclear weapons are stored and act as an obvious warning sign to deter Russian aggression against NATO members.  Evidence that Turkey has discussed selling weapons to Russian mercenary forces would likely raise serious concerns in Washington and complicate Ankara's relationship with other NATO members. Not only does the document reference intelligence about Wagner seeking to purchase weapons from Turkey, it also states that the paramilitary group planned to resume recruitment of prisoners from Russia's jails.  According to the US signals intelligence reporting cited in the document, personnel from the Wagner Group met with ""Turkish contacts"" in early February with the intent ""to purchase weapons and equipment from Turkey"" that could then be used by Wagner mercenaries who are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Wagner also planned to use the weapons and equipment from Turkey in Mali, where the group maintains a significant presence, according to the leaked document. While there is no evidence that shows that Turkey has moved forward with any arms sales to the Wagner Group, details about the February meeting — outlined in a section of the leaked document titled, ""Mali, Russia, Turkey: Vagner seeks weapons from Ankara"" — suggest US officials believe the Russian mercenary outfit has at least tested the waters.  CNN has not independently confirmed the veracity of the document, but US officials have indicated that most of the leaked tranche are authentic. A State Department spokesperson said the ""the Department of Defense and the intelligence community are actively reviewing and assessing the validity"" of the leaked documents, adding ""we are not in a position to confirm or comment on any specific information they contain."" CNN has reached out to the US National Security Council, the office of the Turkish President and Turkey's Embassy in Washington for comment on the document. Read more here. ##Pentagon Docs## The United States imposed a large tranche of sanctions on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Wednesday’s sanctions are the latest action meant to diminish Moscow’s abilities in its war in Ukraine and punish those who are supporting it, including through helping Russia to evade existing sanctions. Sanctions on Russian billionaire and associates: The latest sanctions target a wide network tied to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who is already under sanction in multiple countries, and were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom. According to the US Treasury Department, Usmanov ""is one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires"" who ""holds significant interests in the metals and mining, telecommunications, and information technology sectors.""  He is ""known to be close to multiple U.S.-designated, senior Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Dmitry Medvedev, current deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former president and prime minister of Russia,"" according to a statement.   Sanctions on international companies and a bank: The US also imposed sanctions on companies -- based in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates -- which the US Treasury Department said are supporting Russia’s military industrial complex in defiance of existing sanctions.  The Treasury also sanctioned the International Investment Bank, ""a Russia-controlled financial institution"" in Budapest, as well as its Moscow-based subsidiary and several former and current executives.  ""The IIB’s presence in Budapest enables Russia to increase its intelligence presence in Europe, opens the door for the Kremlin’s malign influence activities in Central Europe and the Western Balkans, and could serve as a mechanism for corruption and illicit finance, including sanctions violations,” according to the Treasury Department.  Sanctions on organizations that target children: In addition, the US State Department is sanctioning two Russian entities ""that support Russia’s efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine through the militarization and indoctrination of schoolchildren: The All Russian Children's And Youth Military Patriotic Public Movement Youth Army, and the State Budgetary Educational Institution of Additional Education of the Republic of Crimea Crimea Patriot Center,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.  According to the State Department, the so-called youth army was created by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and is ""responsible for militarizing and propagandizing schoolchildren in occupied areas of Ukraine."" 
            The ""Crimea Patriot Center"" is ""an organization whose objective is to provide youth with a ‘military-patriotic education’ in order to prepare them for service in the Russia’s Armed Forces,"" it said.  Access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. “Regarding the visit of Evan Gershkovich by representatives of the US Embassy in Moscow, we inform you that the issue is being considered and will be worked out in due time in accordance with consular practice and Russian law. The status assigned to him by the American authorities in this case does not matter,” said Zakharova in a statement published by the ministry Wednesday. Zakharova said the ""noise"" staged in the Western media around the detention of a journalist ""caught red-handed"" is ""an example of blatant hypocrisy."" ""It is kept silent that the American Embassy in Moscow was notified in a timely manner about the detention of Evan Gershkovich. Our diplomats in similar cases, in violation of the bilateral consular convention, are informed either with a delay or not at all, especially in high-profile cases under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Justice and the FBI,"" she said. According to Zakharova, the calls by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials to its citizens to leave the Russian Federation are ""hypocritical,"" since it was Washington that launched ""the real hunt for Russians in the US and third countries."" “I emphasize that any attempts to put pressure on the Russian authorities and the courts, insisting on a 'special treatment' for US citizens who have broken the Russian law, are senseless and futile. It is time for Washington to learn that we will not tolerate interference in our internal affairs and will act exclusively in accordance with our national interests,"" Zakharova added. Some background: On Monday, the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich’s release. Reporting from CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post.

                      The fire at an Indiana plastics recycling plant is close to being extinguished as residents wonder what's now in the air

                      Apr 13, 2023
                    ","
                      After firefighters spent two days battling an inferno fueled by plastics in eastern Indiana, it may be 99% extinguished by Thursday evening or Friday morning, officials said.  But the blaze at a Richmond recycling plant has reignited old frustrations over safety hazards at the facility and sparked new fears among residents about the future of their health. About 2,000 people living within a half-mile radius of the plant are still under evacuation orders Thursday, two days after the fire started. And for the second straight day, Richmond public schools are closed. ""If you are downwind of the area, stay inside, close your windows, and turn off air conditioning,"" Richmond city officials warned. The fire was 90% out as of Thursday afternoon, Richmond Fire Department Chief Tim Brown said at a news conference. Firefighters are now going through the ""hot zone"" in the building and applying foam to extinguish the fire, Brown added. The US Environmental Protection Agency had not detected any toxic compounds as of Wednesday morning and is expected to release updated results Thursday. But the state fire marshal has already said the smoke plumes were ""definitely toxic."" Due to very little wind, ""residents may notice that the smoke from the fire has settled more in and around the city and in areas that had not previously had issues,"" the Wayne County Emergency Management Agency said Thursday morning.  The EPA has been monitoring air quality at 15 locations around the site for the possibility of toxic chemicals from the incinerated plastics.  The billowing black smoke stirred memories of the recent toxic train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio. High levels of some chemicals from that disaster could pose long-term risks, researchers have said. As the black smoke spreads, so do health concerns Corey McConnell's family fled their home in the evacuation zone Tuesday night. He could already smell fumes and saw exhausted firefighters battling the blaze. ""It's really unbelievable,"" McConnell told CNN. ""Makes me worry about the health of my family, not just today but in the future as well. Who knows how long this could be in the air for?"" Resident Wendy Snyder evacuated to a Red Cross emergency shelter but briefly returned home to grab a few belongings, she told CNN affiliate WHIO. That's when she noticed the stench of burning plastic. ""There is a stink in the air when you go outside on our porch,"" Snyder said. ""In fact, it burned my throat because (we) weren't wearing a mask."" The primary health concern to residents is particulate matter -- fine particles found in smoke -- that could cause respiratory problems if inhaled, said Christine Stinson, executive director of the Wayne County Health Department. N95 masks could protect against the particles, but people should leave an area if they see or smell smoke or experience symptoms, Stinson said.  Due to the age of the building, asbestos -- a naturally occurring but very toxic substance once widely used for insulation -- is another possible concern. The EPA was evaluating the area, including school grounds, for potential fire debris that might contain asbestos, it said Wednesday night. And while the EPA's air quality tests had found no signs of toxic chemicals such as styrene or benzene as of mid-Wednesday morning, testing continues as more smoke settles. Such chemicals could increase the risk of cancer if someone is exposed to a high concentration for a prolonged period of time, said Richard Peltier, associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. ""We know that it is very common that a large range of chemicals are formed whenever plastic materials are burned, including styrene, benzene, and a wide number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons -- all of these are strong carcinogens, and it's important for people to avoid exposures,"" Peltier said. Short-term exposure could also cause symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea, coughing, headache and fatigue. ""Asthma is regularly triggered by these types of complicated exposures so if you have asthma, it's really important to be extra careful,"" Peltier said. It's not clear when evacuated residents will be allowed to return home, Richmond officials said. Fire officials expect the smoldering site to burn for several days. City officials blame plant owner for the fire While it's not yet clear what sparked the recycling plant inferno, local leaders have shared concerns since at least 2019 that the facility was riddled with fire hazards and building code violations, records show.  ""We knew it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when this was going to happen,"" the fire chief said. In 2019, the city's Unsafe Building Commission found that the ""cumulative effect of the code violations present"" rendered ""the premises unsafe, substandard, or a danger to the health and safety on the public,"" according to meeting minutes obtained by CNN.  During a commission hearing, the plant's owner, Seth Smith, admitted one of the buildings on the property had no fire extinguishing system, the records show. CNN has reached out to Smith, and the attorney who previously represented him in a related lawsuit declined to comment. Richmond officials ""were aware that what was operating here was a fire hazard,"" Mayor Dave Snow said Wednesday, accusing the plant's owner of ignoring a city order to clean up the property. The fire began in a semitrailer loaded with plastics, then spread to surrounding piles of recyclables before eventually reaching the building, which was ""completely full from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall,"" Brown, fire chief, said. When firefighters arrived, he said, they had difficulty reaching the buildings because access roads were blocked by piles of plastic.  ""Everything that's ensued here -- the fire, the damages, the risk that our first responders have taken and the risk these citizens are under -- are the responsibility of that negligent business owner,"" Snow said.  After Smith was ordered by the city building commission to repair or demolish and vacate his properties in 2019, the plant owner and his company petitioned a court to review the order.  An Indiana circuit court judge ruled in favor of the city in March 2020. The court found in part Smith's properties ""constitute a fire hazard; are a hazard to public health; constitute a nuisance; and are dangerous to people or property because of violations of statute and City Ordinance concerning building condition and maintenance."" The city last year seized two of the three land parcels the recycling plant sits on after Smith failed to pay property taxes.  It's unclear what steps the city took to remedy the site since the seizure and whether it took any steps before 2022 to enforce its orders requiring Smith to repair or demolish and vacate the properties. Smith was contacted by an investigator Tuesday night, the mayor said. While firefighters try to snuff out the blaze, they face another challenge: trying not to destroy potential evidence that might help determine the cause, Brown said.  Officials probably won't be able to identify the cause of the blaze until after the fire is extinguished and investigators can safely enter the plant, the state fire marshal's office said.   Any legal liability against the plant owner will be handled after the cleanup process, City Attorney Andrew J. Sickmann said at a Thursday news conference. ""Whether or not there can be potential criminal liability would be a question for law enforcement and prosecutors,"" Sickmann said. The only operation running out of the building before the fire was moving materials out and shipping them overseas as ordered by officials, Sickmann said. ""It's his mess, it's been shown again and again it's his mess,"" Snow, the mayor, said of the owner. ""Everything that's ensued here remains his responsibility."" Snow added that they are tracking all costs of the incident in case of potential litigation.

                      The mother of a 6-year-old student who shot his first-grade teacher in a classroom in Newport News, Virginia, earlier this year turned herself in Thursday on charges of child neglect and recklessly leaving a firearm so as to endanger a child, her attorney said. Deja Taylor surrendered to the Newport News Sheriff's Office and was later released on $5,000 bond, attorney James Ellenson told CNN. The indictments against Taylor, 26, were announced Monday in a press release from the office of the Commonwealth's Attorney. Ellenson said in a statement Tuesday his client has no criminal record, has cooperated since the shooting occurred and planned to turn herself in before the end of the week. ""As always, first and foremost is the continued health and wellbeing of all persons involved in the incident at Richneck Elementary School, to include both the teacher and Deja's son,"" the statement said. The charges were handed down three months after the shooting at Richneck Elementary School in which the 6-year-old shot his teacher, 25-year-old Abigail Zwerner. She suffered gunshot wounds to her hand and chest but survived. The gun was purchased by Taylor and was kept on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, secured by a trigger lock, Ellenson told CNN in January. The child brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said. The child will not be criminally charged, Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney Howard Gwynn said last month. Prosecutors investigating potential security issues The Commonwealth's Attorney said the office has asked the Circuit Court to empanel a special grand jury to investigate ""any security issues that may have contributed to the shooting."" Zwerner filed a lawsuit this month alleging school administrators and the school board were aware of the student's ""history of random violence"" and did not act proactively amid concerns over a firearm in the boy's possession the day of the shooting. In the lawsuit, which seeks $40 million in compensatory damages, an attorney for Zwerner alleges the 6-year-old was required to be accompanied by a parent during the school day ""because of his violent tendencies."" But that day, school administrators ""allowed him to remain unaccompanied without a one-on-one companion during the school day,"" the complaint says. The suit also alleges the school's then-assistant principal ignored concerns and warning signs flagged by several teachers and staff members, including that the 6-year-old may have had a firearm in his possession in the hours leading up to the January 6 shooting. A guidance counselor and administrator at the elementary school said assistant principal Ebony Parker also ""forbade"" teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his ""mother would be arriving soon to pick him up,"" the complaint says. The boy has an ""acute disability"" and was under a care plan which required a parent to attend school with him, though he was unaccompanied on the day of the shooting, the family has said in a statement. ""We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,"" the statement read. The disturbing shooting drew harsh criticism from parents and led the school board to vote to oust superintendent George Parker III. Ebony Parker, the assistant principal, resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal, Briana Foster Newton, was reassigned to another school, though the district did not say where. CNN has requested comment from Ebony Parker about the lawsuit but has not heard back. Last month, Zwerner told NBC she can't forget the look on the child's face as he aimed the gun at her. ""I remember him pointing the gun at me, I remember the look on his face,"" Zwerner said. ""I remember the gun going off."" She said her recovery has been ""challenging."" ""Some days are not-so-good days where I can't get up out of bed,"" she told NBC. ""Some days are better than others where I'm able to get out of bed and make it to my appointments. But from going through what I've gone through, I try to stay positive.""

                      Three Nepali Sherpas are missing after being buried by a block of snow on Mount Everest, according to a statement from Nepal's Tourism Department on Wednesday. The trio were delivering materials to construct and clear a route to be used by climbers for this year's spring climbing season to get to the top of the world's tallest mountain.  According to the statement, a search and rescue operation is being carried out using helicopters and teams on the ground. ""It increasingly becomes difficult to search and rescue those buried in an avalanche. We are yet to get additional details about their whereabouts. The department is searching for them in coordination with the stakeholders,"" the department's Director General Hom Prasad Luitel told Nepal's state newspaper The Rising Nepal.    The avalanche took place between the base camp and Camp 1 at the place called the Dam.  The area around the treacherous Khumbu icefall -- a steep portion of a glacier shaped like a frozen waterfall -- is one of the most treacherous sections of a route used to summit the 8,848.86 meter (about 29,032 feet) mountain. It is the Sherpas' job to find a safe path across the heavily crevassed Khumbu glacier. Spring is the prime time to climb Mt. Everest, although some mountaineers may climb in the less favorable autumn season.  A total of 243 climbers from 47 countries have so far received permission to the climb the mountain this spring season, according to the tourism department.  Nepal is home to eight of the 10 highest mountains in the world, so mountaineering is a significant source of revenue, employing large teams of Sherpas, guides and porters to support groups of climbers.

                      An Indiana man with a history of schizophrenia died in the summer of 2021 due to organ failure following nearly three weeks in solitary confinement at a Jackson County jail, according to a newly filed lawsuit.   The lawsuit says jailers placed Joshua McLemore, 29, in a windowless, padded isolation cell, where he remained ""confined, naked, alone, and in a constant state of psychosis for the next 20 days."" The suit, filed on behalf of McLemore's estate, is brought against Jackson County and its sheriff Rick Meyer, three jail employees, a doctor who oversaw clinical issues and procedures for the county and jail, and the company that provides health care services at the facility, Advanced Correctional Healthcare.  McLemore's cause of death was ""multiple organ failure due to refusal to eat or drink with altered mental status due to untreated schizophrenia,"" according to a coroner's report provided by his attorney. A history of methamphetamine withdrawal was also noted as a contributing factor.  McLemore's death was the result of ""multiple acts of indifference, as well as systemic and unconstitutional deficiencies"" in the county's policies, practices and training programs, says the suit filed Wednesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.  Additionally, it says the jail did not sufficiently supervise or train its staff on how to handle serious medical or mental health care issues and accuses Advanced Correctional Healthcare of having insufficient training and inadequate staffing. Advanced Correctional Healthcare told CNN in a statement that it was not allowed to disclose patient information, but that it ""is proud to have a 95% client retention rate. ACH has a reputation for solving problems by doing the right thing the first time. In the last year, at least 52 patient lives have been saved."" CNN has reached out to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office for comment. ""Josh McLemore wasn't a criminal,"" Hank Balson, an attorney representing McLemore's estate, told CNN in a statement. ""He was mentally ill and in crisis. He was out of touch with reality and needed help. This is glaringly obvious to anyone who watches the videos of him in his isolation cell."" According to the lawsuit, McLemore struggled with diagnosed schizophrenia and substance abuse and was in the midst of an ""acute mental health crisis."" He was taken to the emergency room to be evaluated after his apartment manager found him in his apartment, naked, confused, and disoriented.   McLemore was arrested for pulling a nurse's hair while in the emergency room, placed in handcuffs and leg shackles, and carried out of the hospital, naked except for his underwear, according to Balson. He was charged with battery against a public official and criminal mischief damage and taken to the Jackson County Jail on July 20, 2021, according to court documents.  Upon arriving at the jail, McLemore was taken to the padded isolation cell and remained there ""almost continuously"" until his death weeks later, the suit says. He was only taken from the cell four times, it said, mainly when jail employees would strap him to a chair and put him under a shower or clean his cell.  Though food was delivered to McLemore's cell door two or three times a day, he didn't retrieve the food or would dump some or all of it on the floor of his cell, which was littered with urine, feces, and torn food containers, according to the suit. While in the cell, McLemore lost nearly 45 pounds.  Guards kept the bathroom adjoining the cell locked for most of the time he was confined, the suit says. Surveillance video included in the lawsuit shows McLemore naked in a cell that appears to have substances smeared on the walls and floor. ""By the time staff finally sent Josh to the hospital, his condition was so dire that the local hospital did not have the clinical resources to treat him and he had to be airlifted to a larger hospital in Cincinnati, where he died two days later,"" the lawsuit said. A 2022 investigation by the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney found that no crimes were committed by jail employees in relation to McLemore's death, according to CNN affiliate WDRB. The lawsuit brings a claim for the violation of McLemore's 14th Amendment rights, accusing all defendants of ""causing him unnecessary pain and suffering and, ultimately, an avoidable death."" It is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

                      Hundreds of thousands of people took part in a fresh round of demonstrations across France on Thursday over government plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, a day before a crucial court ruling on the constitutionality of the divisive law. Protesters in Paris forced their way into the headquarters of luxury giant LVMH, on the day shares in the company -- which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton and Moët -- jumped to a record high.   ""If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,"" Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the LVMH building.   Multiple flare ups have taken place throughout the day. Police halted a protest in front of the Constitutional Council, France's equivalent of the US supreme court, which will hand down a long-awaited ruling on the validity of the pension reform law on Friday. A ban on protests in the area is in place from Thursday evening until Saturday morning local time.  CNN teams on the ground witnessed protesters engaging in intense scuffles with police as smoke bombs, projectiles and tear gas were fired, before a group set off red flares outside the court building. Violence also broke out at Paris' Place de la Bastille as riot police clashed with angry protestors. ""At least a thousand radical individuals present at the forefront of the demonstration area tried on several occasions to commit acts of violence along the route and to hinder the smooth progress of the demonstration,"" a spokesman for the Paris police said. The police were also seen protecting the BHV department store by charging at protesters in the Rue de Rivoli in central Paris. Around 380,000 people attended the protests across France on Thursday, 42,000 of whom were in Paris, according to the latest figures from the French interior ministry.  The figure is down from last week's 11th round of demonstrations which drew in crowds of approximately 570,000. Police had been expecting further violent attacks that have been a visible, if minor, feature of the protests across France over the past two and a half months, with particular attention on so-called ""black bloc"" protesters, part of a radical fringe that has been present from the start of the country's social upheaval. Macron pushing reform France's President Emmanuel Macron argues reforms are essential to rein in public finances, and has been standing firm, this week saying ""the country must continue to move forward."" Speaking at an incinerator picket line near Paris on Thursday morning, Sophie Binet, the new head of the GGT, one of France's main unions, insisted: ""As long as the pension reform is not withdrawn, the mobilization will continue one way or another."" Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo voiced her support for the demonstrators before the new round of protests. ""On the eve of the decision of the constitutional council, I am once again supporting the mobilisations in Paris and everywhere in France,"" Hidalgo tweeted. ""This reform is unjust and violent. The French have been asking for it to be withdrawn for months, the government has to hear them,"" she wrote. Friday's ruling will be decisive on whether the protests will continue. The CFDT, France's other main union, has been more amenable to a negotiated settlement. Garbage is meanwhile also set to fill the streets of Paris once more as collectors and incinerator workers are on strike again, according to the CGT union.  This will be a rolling strike, the general secretary of the CGT union branch confirmed in a letter to the Paris mayor.  The previous near month-long strike, up until the end of March, had seen 10,000 tonnes of rubbish piled up across the capital at its worst.

                      The daughter of Juliana Farmer, one of the five victims of the mass shooting at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, said Wednesday night her mother had just moved to Louisville two weeks prior for a new job.  ""This monster took away my mother, and I'm hurt because my mother moved here to help me, a single mom with four kids. I only got two weeks with her here in Louisville ... a city she knew nothing about,"" Alia Chambers told CNN. ""I'm heartbroken. I hated him. I hated him but I forgive him because my mama is in a better place."" Farmer moved to Louisville from Henderson, Kentucky, and was thrilled to begin her role with Old National Bank as a loan officer. ""My mom went from working at 19 years old at Kmart to sitting with executives at a bank. I'm gonna fulfill my mama's dream. Either I'm going back to nursing school or I'm gonna ask them, can I take over her position at that bank,"" she said. ""She was so excited about that job. She was happy."" Farmer had three adult children and four grandsons, Chambers said.  The day before she was killed, she found out her son, J'Yeon Chambers, was expecting a baby girl, he told CNN. The baby is due in September, the same month his mother was born. ""And so it's just crazy how she gets taken the day after we reveal that we're having the baby. So my child is going to be her basically all over again,"" her son said. ""She gave us the name that she always wanted a girl to be named and we're going to stick with it."" The new details come as CNN has learned more about the victims and wounded in Monday's workplace mass shooting, including the survival of a woman who was seated between two people who were killed. Old National Bank employee Connor Sturgeon, 25, opened fire with an AR15-style rifle in an office conference room and killed five colleagues before he was fatally shot by a responding officer. Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Tommy Elliott, Deana Eckert and James Tutt were shot and killed, police said.  Of the eight people who were wounded, a 26-year-old police officer remains in critical condition after being shot in the head, requiring brain surgery. Woman who was seated between two victims released from hospital One woman who was shot but survived was seated between Farmer and Elliott when the attack began, according to the father of her children, Rex Minrath. Dana Mitchell, an employee at the bank, has returned home from the hospital and is recovering, Minrath told CNN in a phone interview Thursday. She is expected to have surgery in the coming weeks to remove ""the rest of the bullet,"" he said.  ""Dana was in the conference room between Tommy and Juliana. She sat between those two,"" Minrath told CNN. ""And then when they hit the ground, they were all on the ground together. She is fortunate because both of them weren't so lucky."" Mitchell's son, Ross Minrath, posted a series of images and updates about his mother's condition on his Facebook page this week. ""After positive results from blood work and her being an all around badass, my Mom was released from the hospital today,"" he wrote on Tuesday night. ""She is very sore but doing well. Her phone has been at the bank and hopes to start reaching out herself tomorrow."" In one Facebook post, he said the gunshot bruised her lung and that doctors were able to clean the wound on her back. His mother, he added, ""is the toughest I've ever known."" He thanked those who had reached out to the family with well wishes and asked for people to continue to send prayers for his mother. In addition, the first person who was shot inside the bank survived, a city official told CNN. In the shooter's Instagram livestream of the attack, which has since been taken down, the female bank worker said ""good morning"" before the gunman warned her, ""You need to get out of here,"" according to an official familiar with the video. The woman had her back to the gunman as he struggled to get the safety off and load his AR15-style weapon properly. He then shot her in the back, an official previously told CNN. Governor says he's 'empty' after friend's death At a vigil Wednesday, scores of residents and officials gathered Wednesday evening to mourn publicly the employees gunned down at their workplace by a coworker.  ""It's important that we take time to acknowledge those losses and what they mean for us as people and as a community,"" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said during the vigil at the Muhammad Ali Center Plaza. ""So, that later we can gather our energies and focus on preventing these tragedies.""  Greenberg noted the heartbreaking impacts of gun violence in his city beyond Monday's carnage, which unfolded less than a mile from where the vigil was held Wednesday.  ""There will be a time to act. To take steps in honor of those we've lost and to channel our grief and pain into meaningful action. That day is coming,"" the mayor continued. ""Today is to mourn, to lean on each other and support each other."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at the vigil that Elliott, a senior vice president at the bank, was one of his closest friends. ""I'll admit that while I am not angry, I am empty. And I'm sad. And I just keep thinking that maybe we'll wake up,"" Beshear said, his voice breaking.  ""What I know is, I just wish I'd taken an extra moment, made an extra call, tell him how much I care about him. And I know we are all feeling the same. But I also know they hear us now. And that they feel our love,"" Beshear said. Shooter's mother called 911 minutes after massacre began Louisville Metro Police on Wednesday released a series of 911 calls showing the fear and panic both inside and outside the bank during the shooting early Monday morning. In one emergency call, a woman who identified herself as an employee of a different Old National Bank branch told the dispatcher she saw the massacre happen in real time while she was on a video call with colleagues at the scene. ""How do you know you have an active shooter on site?"" the operator asked. ""I just watched it. I just watched it on a Teams meeting. We were having a board meeting,"" she said. ""I saw somebody on the floor. We heard multiple shots and people started saying 'Oh my God,' and then he came into the board room."" Another 911 call came from the gunman's mother, who said her son was headed to the bank with a gun and expressed her shock and confusion. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh my Lord."" The woman said her son ""apparently left a note"" about the incident. ""We don't even own guns. I don't know where he would have gotten a gun."" Other calls came from a bank employee speaking in a whisper who was hiding in a closet, a man who fled the building and took shelter at a nearby dental office, and another caller who hid under a desk inside the building.

                      Classes at a Colorado high school have resumed after two teachers died over the weekend after experiencing symptoms of bacterial meningitis, according to school administrators. The two teachers at Eaglecrest High School in Aurora, 24-year-old Madelaine Michelle Schmidt and 63-year-old Judith Briere Geoffroy, experienced symptoms of bacterial meningitis before their deaths, according to a news release from the Arapahoe County Corner's Office.  The coroner's office said they had performed autopsies on Schmidt and Geoffroy, but the causes of death are still pending. They were unable to confirm the absence or the presence of bacterial meningitis. Eaglecrest High School closed Wednesday to allow public health officials to ""identify students or staff who may have been in close contact with the infected staff person,"" the Cherry Creek School District said in a letter sent to parents Tuesday. ""Arapahoe County Public Health will reach out directly to all staff members and families of students determined to be in close contact,"" the letter said. ""Those individuals will be offered preventative antibiotics."" The district added that school and district mental health support staff will be available for students. Bacterial meningitis can cause death in just a few hours or permanent disabilities for those who recover, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria is usually spread from person to person. Symptoms include fever, headaches, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and ""altered mental status (confusion),"" according to the CDC.

Four of the victims, who died Monday morning, were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63;  and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim -- 57-year-old Deana Eckert -- also died.  Authorities initially said nine others were injured in the attack, including a 26-year-old police officer who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago and was shot in the head. Five of those injured had gunshot wounds, a hospital spokesperson said. Later Monday night, police said Eckert, one of the injured victims, had passed away, bringing the death toll to five.  The mass shooting began at the Old National Bank on East Main Street just after 8:30 a.m. police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN. She watched from her computer as her coworkers were gunned down. Officers got to the bank within three minutes of being dispatched and found the shooter was still firing, Louisville Metro Police Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said. Officers got into a shootout with the gunman, killing him, Gwinn-Villaroel said.  Mayor Craig Greenberg thanked the ""brave and heroic"" first responders for their actions. ""Without a doubt their actions saved lives,"" he said. In the aftermath of the shooting, a large police presence blocked off much of the downtown street. Shattered glass was strewn at the entrance of the Old National Bank, video from CNN affiliate WDRB shows. The shooting is just the latest spasm of mass gun violence, a uniquely American phenomenon. There have been at least 145 mass shootings in the US this year, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter. The gun used in the shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle, is the most popular sporting rifle in the US, and about 24.6 million people have owned an AR-15 or similarly style rifle, according to the 2021 National Firearms Survey. The AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most heinous mass shootings in recent memory, including in the Sandy Hook school in Connecticut; an Aurora, Colorado, theater; a San Bernardino, California, holiday party; and a Buffalo, New York, supermarket. In Nashville, just two weeks ago, a shooter used an AR-15 style weapon and two other guns in a mass shooting at a private Christian elementary school, killing three adults and three 9-year-olds. Gunman joined bank full time in 2021  The shooting was livestreamed on Instagram and has been taken down but not immediately after the shooting. Police are in possession of the video, according to the source. Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at the bank for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining full time in June 2021. A law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that Sturgeon had been notified that he was going to be fired from the bank. But Louisville's mayor and police chief have since said otherwise, with Gwinn-Villaroel telling CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday that that there ""was no discussion about this individual being terminated"" before the massacre. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020 with a bachelors and masters degree in finance, according to a spokesperson for the university. A former high school classmate who knew him and his family well said he never saw any ""sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen."" ""He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,"" said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense. I can't believe it."" In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. ""My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,"" the essay read. ""As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone."" The author wrote that in college, he had ""begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,"" and that he hoped to ""be more self-aware and start becoming a 'better' person."" Rookie officer was shot in the head, police say Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, the police chief said. He is in critical condition. Wilt had graduated from the police academy on March 31, just 10 days before the shooting.  At a news conference Monday, Gov. Andy Beshear said one of those killed in the shooting, Tommy Elliot, was ""one of my closest friends."" Elliott was a senior vice president at the bank, according to his LinkedIn. ""Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad,"" Beshear said. ""He's one of the people I talked to most in the world and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend."" 'I witnessed people being murdered.' witness says Buchheit-Sims said the shooting unfolded very quickly as she watched the bank's morning meeting virtually.  ""Shortly after the meeting started, the gunman, which is an employee, started shooting up the conference room,"" Buchheit-Sims said. ""I witnessed people being murdered. I don't know how else to say that.""  Caleb Goodlett got a call from his wife, who works at Old National Bank, he told CNN affiiliate WLKY. She told him there was an active shooter and she was locked in a vault inside the bank. Goodlett called 911 but officers were already aware of the shooting. He described it as a traumatic phone call at 8:30 a.m., and said he has since talked to and seen his wife and that she is fine. Hagan Curd was walking his dog on East Main Street on Monday morning when he began to see people running in his direction, he said. Several gunshots can be heard in video he took at the scene. ""I saw people running and then some others got out (of) their car and began to run as well,"" Curd said. ""Then I heard police yelling and telling people there was a shooter at the bank and to back away."" The Old National Bank is dual-headquartered in Evansville, Indiana, and Chicago and has more than 250 banking centers across the Midwest. The bank's executive team is headed to Louisville, the company said on Facebook. ""The safety of Old National Bank employees and everyone we serve in our banking center locations is paramount,"" said Old National CEO Jim Ryan. ""As we await more details, we are deploying employee assistance support and keeping everyone affected by this tragedy in our thoughts and prayers."" The Louisville metro area, located along Kentucky's border with Indiana, has a population of about 630,000 people as of the 2020 Census. The 300 block of East Main Street is bordered to the east by the minor league stadium Louisville Slugger Field and includes a dentist's office, a furniture store and the Louisville Ballet. President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Republicans in Congress to take action on gun laws. ""Once again, our nation mourns after a senseless act of gun violence -- Jill and I pray for the lives lost and impacted by today's shooting. Too many Americans are paying for the price of inaction with their lives. When will Republicans in Congress act to protect our communities?"" Biden said in a tweet. Correction: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect age for the shooter based on information from police. He was 25. This article has also been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.

                      Bank employees, an ""incredible friend,"" a beloved parishioner, police officers and a ""huge fan and supporter"" of the community are among the five people killed and others hospitalized after a gunman opened fire inside a bank in downtown Louisville. Monday's attack was the 146th US mass shooting this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and came exactly two weeks after three children and three adults were shot to death at a Christian school in neighboring Tennessee, fueling a fierce fight between Democratic and Republican state lawmakers over gun control. In Louisville, a 26-year-old rookie officer ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. Nickolas Wilt, who had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting, underwent brain surgery and on Tuesday was in critical but stable condition, a hospital spokesperson said. Nine patients, including three Louisville Metro Police officers, were treated at University of Louisville Hospital following the shooting, the spokesperson said. Five had gunshot wounds; one died Monday night. Here's what we know so far about those killed: Joshua Barrick Joshua Barrick, 40, was a ""devoted husband, father, son, brother, and friend"" who ""would do anything for anyone and cherished his time with them,"" his brother Jeff Barrick told CNN in a statement. Joshua ""had a wonderful sense of humor, was sentimental, and was passionate about life,"" his brother said. Joshua Barrick and his family were members of the Holy Trinity Parish Louisville, the church wrote on Facebook.  ""Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,"" they wrote. ""Please keep the entire Barrick family in your prayers, including his wife, Jessica, and their two sweet children, who are students in our school.""  ""His involvement with Holy Trinity gave him a sense of purpose and community,"" his brother said. ""He will be missed by all that knew him."" The church held a vigil Monday evening for Barrick. Deana Eckert Deana Eckert, 57, was hospitalized, then died later Monday, police announced. She was a ""very kind and a very thoughtful person,"" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Thomas Elliott Old National Bank Senior Vice President Thomas Elliott was a close mentor and beloved community leader, local and state leaders said. ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" state Sen. David Yates told CNN. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up."" Elliott, 63, was also close friends with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott's wife. ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and called the others who were killed ""amazing people"" who will be missed and mourned by their communities. ""To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,"" Greenberg added. Old National Bank executive team members, including CEO Jim Ryan, were in Louisville on Monday after the shooting, the company said on Facebook. ""As we await more details, we are deploying employee assistance support and keeping everyone affected by this tragedy in our thoughts and prayers,"" Ryan said in a statement Monday morning. Juliana Farmer Juliana Farmer, 45, had just started a new chapter in her life, moving to Louisville from Henderson, Kentucky, her daughter Alia Chambers told CNN. ""This monster took away my mother, and I'm hurt because my mother moved here to help me, a single mom with four kids,"" she said. ""I only got two weeks with her here in Louisville ... a city she knew nothing about. I'm heartbroken.""  Farmer was thrilled to begin her role with Old National Bank as a loan officer, Chambers said, after moving to Louisville two weeks ago from Henderson.  ""My mom went from working at 19 years old at Kmart to sitting with executives at a bank,"" she said. ""I'm gonna fulfill my mama's dream. Either I'm going back to nursing school or I'm gonna ask them, can I take over her position at that bank.""  Farmer had three adult children and four grandsons, Chambers said.  The day before she was killed -- Easter Sunday -- Farmer had found out her son, J'Yeon Chambers, was expecting a baby girl, he told CNN. The baby is due in September, the same month his mother was born. ""It's just crazy how she gets taken the day after we reveal that we're having the baby,"" he said. ""My child is going to be her basically all over again,"" Farmer's son said. ""She gave us the name that she always wanted a girl to be named, and we're going to stick with it."" James Tutt James ""Jim"" Tutt, 64, was a ""huge fan and supporter"" of the downtown Louisville area and helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN. Tutt, a native of Frankfort, Kentucky, worked as the commercial real estate market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, according to his LinkedIn account. He had served on the board of the non-profit Downtown Development Corporation since 2018, recently as its treasurer. ""Jim was very helpful to me as I started my role with Louisville Downtown Partnership last year and had an 'open-door policy' with taking any call or question,"" Fleischaker said. ""Jim will be deeply missed.""

                      Mortgage rates drop for fifth week in a row

                      Homebuyers are embracing mortgage rates dipping closer and closer to 6%. Rates fell for the fifth week in a row as inflation continues to ease. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.27% in the week ending April 13, down slightly from 6.28% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 5%. ""Incoming data suggest inflation remains well above the desired level but showing signs of deceleration,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ""These trends, coupled with tight labor markets, are creating increased optimism among prospective homebuyers as the housing market hits its peak in the spring and summer."" The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. Inflation continues to cool The economy continues to give off some mixed signals, but as long as inflation is cooling, it is good for mortgage rates. The average rate dropped lower this week as bond yields bounced back from last week's lows following economic data including last Friday's jobs report that signaled a moderating, but still relatively strong job market, said Danielle Hale, Realtor.com chief economist. This week's inflation data, based on the March Consumer Price Index, left plenty of room for interpretation, she said.  ""On the one hand, the fact that inflation is still running at more than twice the target level, and core inflation — which includes goods and services, excluding volatile food and energy — saw an uptick to 5.6% in March, highlights that the Fed still has more to do and may need to lift short-term rates again at its early May meeting,"" said Hale.  ""On the other hand, overall inflation slowed more notably, and even core inflation on a month-to-month basis eased somewhat, a sign that the Fed's tightening is having the desired effect,"" she added. ""Even if the Fed needs to raise short-term rates a bit higher, we are very likely nearing the end of the tightening cycle.""  The Fed does not set the interest rates that borrowers pay on mortgages directly, but its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed's actions, what the Fed actually does and investors' reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. ""As long as the economy continues to see progress on inflation, that should help keep mortgage rates at the lower end of the 6% to 7% range that we've seen over the past few months,"" Hale said. ""However, any surprises in the data will likely lead to some volatility in that range.""  Homebuyers are taking advantage of lower rates Even before the recent easing in mortgage rates, buyers and sellers registered some improvement in sentiment toward housing with higher levels of pending sales. Recent drops in rates have brought in some buyers, and mortgage applications were up last week from the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""Prospective homebuyers responded to lower rates last week, leading to an 8% jump in applications to buy a home,"" said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. ""The likelihood of even lower rates in the months ahead should lead to increased demand, despite recent signs of a slowing economy and tighter financial conditions.""  As long as the current dip in mortgage rates can be sustained, buyers will be on the hunt. That may pull more homeowners into the market as sellers, said Hale.  ""Despite the huge shifts in market momentum, home sellers can count on the usual seasonal trends tipping the scales a bit further in their favor while home shoppers should expect a fair amount of competition that should ease as we move later into the year,"" she said.

                      A judge on Monday denied Elizabeth Holmes' request to remain free while she appeals her conviction, setting the stage for the disgraced Theranos founder to report to prison later this month.  In his order, Judge Edward Davila of the Northern District of California said Holmes does not pose a danger to the community or a flight risk, but he cast doubt on her appeal. Even if Holmes won her appeal, he said, it is unlikely to result in a reversal, or an order for a new trial, for all of the counts on which she was found guilty. Davila previously ordered Holmes to turn herself into custody on April 27, 2023. Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison last November, after she was convicted months earlier on multiple charges of defrauding investors while running the failed blood testing startup Theranos. Attorneys for Holmes did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the ruling. Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, Holmes' ex-boyfriend and the former chief operating officer at Theranos, was also found guilty on multiple counts of fraud in a separate trial. He was sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison last December. Balwani's request to remain out of prison during his appeal was also denied, and he has been ordered by Davila to surrender to prison on April 20.  Once valued at $9 billion, Theranos attracted top investors and retail partners with claims that it had developed technology to test for a wide range of conditions using just a few drops of blood. The company began to unravel after a Wall Street Journal investigation in 2015 reported that Theranos had only ever performed roughly a dozen of the hundreds of tests it offered using its proprietary technology, and with questionable accuracy. Holmes' trial was initially delayed multiple times, due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and then because of her pregnancy. Following her sentencing in November, Holmes sought to delay the start of her prison term after giving birth to her second child.  While Davila denied Holmes represented a flight risk, he also addressed the fact that she had previously booked a one-way ticket to Mexico in January 2022. ""Booking international travel plans for a criminal defendant in anticipation of a complete defense victory is a bold move, and the failure to promptly cancel those plans after a guilty verdict is a perilously careless oversight,"" Davila wrote in the court filing.  Holmes' attorneys had previously claimed that Holmes had hoped the verdict would be different when booking the travel plans and that she wanted to make this trip to attend the wedding of friends in Mexico. Davila wrote in court documents that the court accepts Holmes' ""representation that the oneway flight ticket—while ill-advised—was not an attempt to flee the country.""

                      Tupperware: How a plastic bowl with a 'burp seal' gave women a means to an income

                      Tupperware, an iconic brand that's woven into the fabric of post World War II America, signaled this week that it could be on its last gasp.  Known the world over for its plastic food storage containers and its sales parties, Florida-based Tupperware warned that the company was running out of cash and needed additional money -- soon -- to say in operation. In some ways, the 77-year-old brand is still a titan: It's, literally, a household name, and its vivid juice- and fruit-colored products are for sale in nearly 70 countries. It pulled in annual sales of $1.3 billion in 2021. But that's down 18.7% from a year ago.  Last October, in a massive shift in its business model, Tupperware rolled out its containers in brighter hues of red, purple and green onto Target shelves nationwide.  But it may be too little, too late.  Experts say this is what happens when a once-pioneering brand, beloved by families through generations, is unable to adapt to an evolving marketplace, brutal competition and attitudes and needs of younger consumers. ""Tupperware was a disruptor in the market and in households nationwide when its plastic storage containers launched in 1946,"" said Ventakesh Shankar, professor of marketing and ecommerce at Texas A&M University's Mays Business School.  ""The company also had tremendous cultural impact. The famous neighborhood house parties where Tupperware products were sold by the host to her family and friends was a new way of marketing, combining socializing with direct sales."" But while the company reaped the benefits of its innovative approach for years, it ultimately couldn't keep pace with changing times. History has shown, said Shankar, that nostalgia usually isn't enough to sustain legacy brands. Whether or not Tupperware survives as a business, its rich history will likely endure, said William Keep, professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey School of Business. ""I've been married for 50 years and we still have and use our Tupperware from when we married. Tupperware was something people gave as gifts at weddings and baby showers,"" said Keep. ""Clearly its a brand that focused on two things, quality and for much of its history, women.""   Battling food waste Tupperware is named after Earl Tupper, a chemist in the 1940s who created lightweight, non-breakable plastic containers inspired by the seal-tight design of paint cans. The purpose was to help families save money on costly food waste in the post-war era.  The most significant aspect of the invention was a first-of-its-kind ""burping seal."" The older models of Tupperware containers would make a burp-like sound when air was let out from under the lid before it was firmly pressed and closed for an air-tight lock. But Tupperware products didn't sell well in stores when they launched, according to the company, because consumers weren't sure how to use the (back then) white and off-white containers.  That conundrum led to an idea to demonstrate the product, which then evolved into the famous Tupperware house parties.  The practice dove-tailed brilliantly with the rise of post-war suburbia: women had bigger homes, bigger kitchens, more money to spend, more children to feed and more responsibilities to keep house. Into that climate came Tupperware. Its first milky-white plastic product, the ""Wonder Bowl,"" cost 39 cents, according to Smithsonian Magazine; the museum has a huge Tupperware collection. Over the years, tangerine orange, baby blue and pink and kiwi green products followed. Tupperware stereotyped women as much as it empowered them Tupperware parties became popular social and marketing events in the 1950s and 60s.  The parties were much more than just a show-and-tell, said Bob Kealing, a Tupperware scholar and author of two books on the brand.  These were glamorous affairs, akin to an afternoon tea party, where women dressed up because the parties were a feminized, soft-sell approach to selling plastic products. ""Women wore beautiful dresses, heels, gloves. They wanted to present an upscale version of themselves because these were also events where women were recruited into the Tupperware sales force,"" he said. The parties gained traction also because they were one of the few socially acceptable ways for women to make money at the time. Tupperware products were the centerpiece of the event, carefully stacked and presented to be shown off. ""The parties were designed to be fun social gatherings,"" including games and prizes, he said, and the most successful Tupperware saleswomen were sometimes rewarded with diamond rings. The rise of suburbia While Tupperware wasn't the first to pioneer the direct sales model, it did scale it up in size and opportunity for women, said Tracey Deutsch, associate professor, department of history  of history at University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts. Tupperware's success, said Deutsch also coincided with the expansion of suburbs across the country. ""Not only did women need the space to hold the Tupperware parties but also space in the kitchen to store these containers,"" she said. ""And it was also dependent on a certain level of household well-being. You needed to have enough food to require these storage containers."" Brownie Wise was perhaps the most famous Tupperware hostess of them all. Wise, a divorced single mother living in Florida, held her own Tupperware parties in the 1940s and 50s and became a budding entrepreneur. Tupper himself took notice.  He eventually hired Wise as his vice president of marketing, an unprecedented role for women back then. A famous Tupperware lady Kealing, author of """"Life of the Party: The Remarkable Story of How Brownie Wise Built, and Lost, a Tupperware Part Empire,""  said Wise became the face of the brand and was very good at it.  ""It was great marketing and the media ate it up,"" he said. But she was ultimately fired by Tupper in 1957. ""Tupper... saw how the brand was becoming more about her,"" said Kealing. Traditionally, parties were the only way you could buy Tupperware. Over time, the parties became ubiquitous both in suburban and city dwellings.  As the company grew, its fleet of hostesses ballooned into a global direct sales force of nearly 3 million in 2019. More recently, the brand was on a quest to grab the attention of Millennials and Gen Zers and become as relevant in their everyday lives as it was for their grandmas and moms. Shelving the Mad Men era That meant shedding the throwback to its ""Mad Men"" era image, and positioning Tupperware products as buzz-worthy, higher quality and more durable than rivals, high-utility and with an environmentally-friendly purpose.  Tupperware had to go beyond parties or sales on its own website and the brief and limited pilot programs it had tried with retailers HomeGoods, Bed Bath and Beyond, plus an earlier pilot attempt at Target itself. The shift in strategy came too late. ""We've seen this happen with Toys 'R' Us, Twinkie, most recently Bed Bath & Beyond,"" said Shankar.  Tupperware, he said, is facing a perfect storm of stiff competition from other brands -- Rubbermaid, Glad, Pyrex, Oxo and Ziploc -- selling similar products or even disposable versions for less, lack of interest from younger shoppers and lack of exciting new products and strategies to sell them. ""Millennials, and Gen Zers especially probably aren't aware of its iconic status and really don't have a reason to give it another chance,"" said Shankar. What went wrong? ""In my mind, the company made two critical errors,"" said Keep, professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey School of Business. ""With product, it lost ground to competitors"", said Keep. ""Tupperware also consciously didn't walk away from direct selling even as these multilevel marketing strategies stagnated in the 80s and 90s. When it was clear that model was no longer working, the company should have given up on direct sales and sold through retailers."" Bankruptcy could be a path forward for Tupperware, said JohnTalbott, Director at the Center for Education and Research in Retail at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business. ""The most valuable thing Tupperware owns is its brand. Like Blockbuster, the Tupperware brand will never go away,"" he said. ""I suspect it could file for bankruptcy and if there is a buyer for it, Target would be a great option to revive the brand with new designs and a new marketing plan.""

                      Amazon will charge customers a fee for some UPS returns

                      Amazon is attempting new measures to get customers to return fewer of their online orders, including charging a fee to return items to UPS stores. For decades, Amazon built its business by creating shopping that was fast, ridiculously easy and, seemingly, error-proof. You don't like it, just return it.  But not anymore: so many customers have buyers' regret, or simply bigger feet than they thought they had, that handling returns has become an expensive problem for the company.  Amazon will start charging customers a $1 fee if they return items to a UPS store when there is a Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh grocery store or Kohl's closer to their delivery address. (Amazon owns Whole Foods and Fresh, and has a partnership deal with Kohl's.)  Amazon still offers free return options, and an Amazon spokesperson said the fee would apply to a small number of customers. The company still offers a way for these customers to return stuff for free by bringing items to Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Kohl's. The Information first reported on Amazon's fee. Shoppers have become accustomed to endless free returns in recent years, but Amazon and other companies are trying to curb this customer habit. Amazon also recently started flagging ""frequently returned"" products on its website. Amazon is adding the badge to product listings on items with ""significantly higher return rates for their product category,"" a spokesperson said. Zara, H&M, J.Crew, Anthropologie, Abercrombie & Fitch and other chains are now slapping on fees of up to $7 to return items online; some retailers have tightened their return windows.  Customers sent back around 17% of the total merchandise they purchased in 2022, totaling $816 billion, according to data from the National Retail Federation. That's a strain on retailers: For every $1 billion in sales, the average retailer incurs $165 million in merchandise returns, according to the NRF. Companies have to cover costly shipping fees in order for customers to send their products back. Those items sometimes wind up back in retailers' warehouses or on shelves. Stores then have to mark down returned goods to sell them, further squeezing their profit. More often, returned products can end up in liquidation warehouses or even landfills, which are an environmental threat.

                      Amazon is 'investing heavily' in the technology behind ChatGPT

                      Amazon wants investors to know it won't be left behind in the latest Big Tech arms race over artificial intelligence. In a letter to shareholders Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company is ""investing heavily"" in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, the same technology that underpins ChatGPT and other similar AI chatbots. ""We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences,"" Jassy wrote in his letter to shareholders.  The remarks, which were part of Jassy's second annual letter to shareholder since taking over as CEO, hint at the pressure that many tech companies feel to explain how they can tap into the rapidly evolving marketplace for AI products. Since ChatGPT was released to the public in late November, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all talked up their growing focus on generative AI technology, which can create compelling essays, stories and visuals in response to user prompts. Amazon's goal, according to Jassy, is to offer less costly machine learning chips so that ""small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production."" Large language models are trained on vast troves of data in order to generate responses to user prompts.   ""Most companies want to use these large language models, but the really good ones take billions of dollars to train and many years, most companies don't want to go through that,"" Jassy said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday morning. ""What they want to do is they want to work off of a foundational model that's big and great already, and then have the ability to customize it for their own purposes,"" Jassy told CNBC.  With that in mind, Amazon on Thursday unveiled a new service called Bedrock. It essentially makes foundation models (large models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data) from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI and Amazon accessible to clients via an API, Amazon said in a blog post.  Jassy told CNBC he thinks Bedrock ""will change the game for people.""  In his letter to shareholders, Jassy also touted AWS's CodeWhisperer, another AI-powered tool which he said ""revolutionizes developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time.""  ""I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I'll leave that for a future letter,"" Jassy wrote. ""Let's just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.""  In the letter, Jassy also reflected on leading Amazon through ""one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,"" as the e-commerce giant cut some 27,000 jobs as part of a major bid to rein in costs in recent months.  ""There were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year,"" Jassy said in the letter, before outlining steps Amazon took to rethink certain free shipping options, abandon some of its physical store concepts and significantly reduce overall headcount. Amazon disclosed in a securities filing Thursday that Jassy's pay package last year was valued at some $1.3 million, and that the CEO did not receive any new stock awards in 2022. (When Jassy took over as CEO in 2021, he was awarded a pay package mostly comprised of stock awards that valued his total compensation package at some $212 million.) Despite the challenges at Amazon, however, Jassy said in his letter that he finds himself ""optimistic and energized by what lies ahead."" Jassy added: ""I strongly believe that our best days are in front of us.""

                      Shares in LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, jumped to a record high after it reported strong first-quarter sales buoyed by the economic re-opening in China. The stock of Europe's most valuable company rose 4.6% Thursday to hit €875 ($965) apiece, boosting the fortune of its owner Bernard Arnault, already the world's richest man.   LVMH was targeted by opponents of French President Emmanuel Macron's pension reforms on Thursday. Protesters taking part in a nationwide strike against an increase in the retirement age forced their way into the company's headquarters in Paris.  ""If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,"" Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the building.   The owner of brands such as Tiffany & Co. and Dior reported late on Wednesday sales of €21 billion ($17 billion) in the first three months of the year, up 17% from the same period in 2022.  The conglomerate said first-quarter sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 14% year-over-year, which represented a ""significant rebound."" Sales were lifted by the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in Asia, LVMH said in a statement. China ended its strict zero-Covid policy in December.  ""We registered some pretty nice pick-up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,"" Jean-Jacques Guinoy, LVMH's chief financial officer, said Wednesday.  The company's cosmetics lines were still a ""little under pressure"" in mainland China, Guinoy added, though leather goods and jewelry were performing well in the world's second-biggest economy.  ""Overall, we are extremely optimistic,"" he said.  In Europe and Japan, first-quarter sales were strong, rising 24% and 34% respectively, thanks to ""robust demand"" from local consumers and international travelers. In the United States, sales rose 8%.  Stocks in the $460 billion company have rocketed 29% since the start of the year, with the luxury goods market proving resilient in the face of high global inflation and fears that some economies could tip into recession.  Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, overtook Elon Musk to become the world's richest person in December, with a total net worth of $198 billion to Musk's $176 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. — Oliver Briscoe and Xiaofei Xu in Paris contributed reporting.

                      Why Walmart is closing half its stores in Chicago
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/business/walmart-chicago-stores-closing/index.html,"

                    ","
                      Walmart plans to close half its stores in Chicago, a reversal of the retail giant's high-profile commitment in 2020 to expand in the city as part of its corporate racial justice initiative in the wake of George Floyd's murder by police. Walmart announced Tuesday that next week it will close four poor-performing stores out of the eight it operates in Chicago. Three of the locations are located in Chicago's South and West Side neighborhoods, which are predominantly minority and have long struggled with grocery and retail access. One of the stores is in Chicago's North Side, which is predominantly White and more affluent. The announcement comes after Walmart highlighted its efforts in Chicago as a ""critical part"" of its broader $100 million pledge to advancing racial equity in 2020.  ""Chicago will be an example of what's possible when we leverage business, government and community organizations for the good of all,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in 2021. It also follows more than a decade of intense efforts by Chicago political leaders to draw Walmart and other chains to underserved areas to spur economic development. But Walmart said Tuesday that these four stores lose tens of millions of dollars a year and that annual losses have nearly doubled in the last five years. The company said it tried several strategies to improve the stores and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the city. ""Unfortunately, these efforts have not materially improved the fundamental business challenges our stores are facing,"" Walmart said in a blog post. The company said workers in these stores will be eligible to switch to other Walmart stores and it will work with local leaders to help find reuse options for the buildings.  Walmart said its remaining four Chicago stores ""continue to face the same business difficulties,"" but it believes closing these four will give the others the best chance of staying open. The closures call attention to the recent pullback in major US cities by Walmart and other national chains. They also raise questions about the effectiveness of government strategies that closely rely on national chains to improve food and retail access in underserved areas. David Merriman, a professor of public policy, management and analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago, found in a 2012 study of Walmart's impact in Chicago that businesses closer to Walmart were significantly more likely to close than similar businesses farther away. The study also found that the number of jobs lost by nearby retail competitors essentially offset the number of jobs created at the new Walmart stores. ""Communities around the city shouldn't see Walmart or other big-box retailers as a panacea for local economic problems,"" he said. 'An example of what's possible' In 2020, Walmart temporarily closed all eight of its stores in Chicago during protests in the city and across the country over Floyd's murder by police. There were fears that Walmart and other businesses would leave Chicago, but Walmart pledged to stay and invest in the city.  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Walmart's McMillon announced in June 2020 that Walmart would reopen its stores and also build two health centers and a training academy for employees in Chicago.  ""Walmart's commitment to Chicago remains strong. We are not going anywhere,"" McMillon said.  He also said at the time that Walmart's stores in Chicago collectively operate at a loss due to a ""combination of our sales, product margin and expenses."" He said Walmart would try to reduce losses without raising prices or cutting workers' wages or hours.  Walmart ""may have to revisit these decisions again"" if they weren't working after a few years, he cautioned, ""but that's not what we hope for or plan on.""  A year later, McMillon said ""Walmart wants to serve the people of this great city, build a successful business and work with those who are determined to see Chicago fulfill its potential."" In a statement Tuesday, Lightfoot said she was ""incredibly disappointed that Walmart, a strong partner in the past,"" was closing stores. ""Unceremoniously abandoning these neighborhoods will create barriers to basic needs for thousands of residents,"" she said. ""I call on Walmart to ensure that these soon-to-be-closed stores are repurposed with significant community engagement so they can find a new use to serve their neighborhoods."" Struggles in cities Walmart's decision follows years of attempts by the company to move into big US cities. Walmart expanded in rural and suburban areas during the 1980s and 1990s and began to try to enter cities in the early 2000s. But the company was met with stiff resistance in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities from unions and Democratic opponents who worried non-union Walmart would drive down wages and hurt small businesses. In 2006, Walmart overcame opposition in Chicago and opened its first store. Chicago's mayor at that time, Richard M. Daley, paved the way for Walmart by vetoing an ordinance requiring all big-box stores to pay their employees a $10 minimum wage.  Other Chicago leaders saw bringing in Walmart and national chains as a way to boost the economy and provide access to fresh food in Chicago's predominantly Black South Side area. ""This Wal-Mart is a win-win-win — a win for the local economy, a win for local job creation, and a win for the Chicagoans,"" Chicago's then-mayor Rahm Emanuel said in 2012 when Walmart opened a store in the city's Chatham neighborhood. (It's one of the stores now slated for closure.) But this strategy was misplaced, said Stacy Mitchell, the co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration. She believes the city should have taken stronger efforts to support smaller grocers who have been squeezed by big chains. ""Chicago city leaders bent over backwards to lure Walmart to the city,"" she said. ""What they should have been doing was supporting the development of local businesses with a real commitment to the city and its residents.""  Walmart is retrenching in some cities. It has also closed stores in Portland, Oregon, recently.  The benefits of Walmart's ability to drive down costs and keep prices low have proven less effective in cities. Walmart's typical 180,000 square-foot supercenter model is not as well suited for urban neighborhoods as it is for suburban and rural areas, said Ray Wimer, a professor of retail practice at Syracuse University.  Walmart is also not the only national chain that has closed stores in major cities. A Whole Foods flagship closed in San Francisco on Monday, citing concerns about worker safety. Walgreens and CVS have also closed in San Francisco and New York, while Starbucks closed 16 locations across various cities. These retailers face several challenges in cities. Urban locations carry higher rents, which means they need to hit higher sales targets to break even, Wimer told CNN. Some retailers have also cited higher levels of theft and other crime in their city stores. In addition, Covid-19 pandemic safety lockdowns and the rise of remote work have hurt foot traffic and sales to stores. And the growth of Amazon and same-day delivery has made going to stores less appealing for urban residents.  Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified the location of one of Walmart's shuttered locations.

                      Here's a look at the Penn State sexual abuse scandal. On November 4, 2011, a grand jury report was released containing testimony that former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky sexually abused eight young boys over a period of at least 15 years. Officials at Penn State purportedly failed to notify law enforcement after learning about some of these incidents. On December 7, 2011, the number of victims increased to 10. Sandusky was found guilty in 2012. Included is a timeline of accusations, lists of the charges against Sandusky, a list of involved parties, a post grand jury report timeline, information about The Second Mile charity and Sandusky with links to the grand jury investigation.

The Sanduskys also fostered several children. Occupation: Assistant football coach at Penn State for 32 years before his retirement, including 23 years as defensive coordinator. The Second Mile Initially founded by Sandusky in 1977 as a group foster home for troubled boys, but grew into a non-profit organization that ""helps young people to achieve their potential as individuals and community members."" May 25, 2012 - The Second Mile requests court approval in Centre County, Pennsylvania, to transfer its programs to Arrow Child & Family Ministries and shut down.  August 27, 2012 - The Second Mile requests a stay in their petition to transfer its programs to Arrow Child & Family Ministries saying, ""this action will allow any pending or future claims filed by Sandusky's victims to be resolved before key programs or assets are considered for transfer.""

Later, McQueary meets with Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz.

                      Summerlike heat will continue to build across the Midwest and Northeast through Friday, as temperatures soar to as much as 30 degrees above normal.  Nearly 90 daily records could be broken on Thursday and Friday, mainly across the Midwest and Northeast, and at least 50 record-high minimum temperatures could be set.  This comes after more than 35 daily record highs were broken on Wednesday from Nebraska to Delaware.  Sioux Falls, South Dakota, hit 92 degrees on Wednesday, shattering its old record of 85 set in 1908. Twin Cities, Minnesota, also broke a record after reaching a high of 88 degrees.  Record heat will continue As an area of high pressure continues to build in the region, this will allow for temperatures to continue to warm and dry conditions to prevail.  ""The dry airmass in place makes it quite easy to overachieve on highs and it is certainly possible that we approach 90 again in La Crosse,"" the National Weather Service office in La Crosse, Wisconsin, said. If La Crosse hits 90, that would shatter their old record of 80 degrees. The heat will stretch as far as the Northeast and parts of New England, with New York City expected to top out in the mid-80s, which will come close to tying or breaking records for Thursday and Friday.  Cities including Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington and even Boston could set records this week.  ""Most areas away from Cape Cod, the immediate south coast and the North Shore should see their first 80 degree day since Sept/Oct 2022, and it is not out of the question that the Hartford and Springfield CT Valley areas could get very close to or reach 90,"" the weather service office in Boston said. Overnight lows are also staying warm, which doesn't allow for much recovery from the heat. More than 75 record-high minimum temperatures could be set by Saturday morning.  Warm temperatures, along with low humidity levels and gusty winds, will create an elevated risk of wildfires. Elevated fire risk  The weather service is warning of an elevated fire risk while the record warmth and dry conditions persist. ""Fine fuels in the form of dry or dead vegetation will be quite dry as well, and conducive to fire starts and fairly quick fire spread,"" the weather service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, warned. ""This is particularly true in areas that have not received hardly any rainfall in the last 10 days, across much of Pennsylvania to northern and central New Jersey."" Winds could gust as high as 35 mph, which will cause any fire that forms to spread quickly. A wildfire has already broken out in New Jersey this week. The fire is now 75% contained, but it has already scorched roughly 4,000 acres and forced evacuations.

                      The father of a missing Minnesota mother's children said he is cooperating with law enforcement ""at every turn,"" nearly two weeks after the disappearance of 26-year-old Madeline Kingsbury.  Adam Fravel denied any involvement in Kingsbury's disappearance in a statement Wednesday. ""Over the course of the last 12 days my family and I have been subject to a myriad of accusations regarding the disappearance of the mother of my children, Maddi Kingsbury. During these last 12 days I have cooperated with law enforcement at every turn, including sitting down for multiple interviews with Winona County law enforcement.  ""I did not have anything to do with Maddi's disappearance. I want the mother of my 5-year-old and 2-year-old to be found and brought home safely. I want that more than anything,"" said Fravel.  Fravel said he had been advised by law enforcement on April 2 not to attend news conferences or assist in searches for Kingsbury due to safety concerns. ""My non-attendance and silence has been inferred by many as a sign of apathy, or worse. That could not be further from the truth. I want Maddi home and for her to be able to be with our two children,"" said Fravel. Kingsbury was last seen on the morning of March 31.  She did not show up at work as expected the day she disappeared, and did not answer calls from family and friends, police said. She didn't pick up her children from day care that afternoon or make other arrangements. Evidence suggests Kingsbury's disappearance was ""involuntary and suspicious,"" the Winona Police Department said in a Wednesday update. ""We remain extremely concerned for her safety,"" police said in their update.  ""We have drafted and served numerous search warrants as part of our search efforts."" The update didn't address whether Fravel has been cooperating with authorities. Kingsbury's family said in a statement Wednesday they have been working with investigators in the search for her. ""Members of our family and close friends coordinate closely with law enforcement and send out search teams day after day, every day,"" the statement said. ""We will find Madeline. This is our mission and we will not falter."" Police have said they believe her vehicle, a 2014 dark blue Chrysler Town and Country, may have traveled from Winona to eastern Fillmore County on the day of her disappearance.  They have asked residents in that area to check their ""video cameras, doorbell cameras, game cameras ... for any signs of the van passing through or stopping."" Winona is in southeastern Minnesota, near the Wisconsin border.

                      What is El Niño?

                      El Niño is a climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world.   Warm water normally is confined to the western Pacific by winds that blow from east to west, pushing it toward Indonesia and Australia. But during an El Niño, the winds slow down and can even reverse direction, allowing the warmer water to spread eastward all the way to South America.  Scientists are still searching for an answer as to why this happens, but the slowing of these winds can last for weeks or months. El Niños -- among many large-scale weather patterns that act in tandem to influence global weather -- occur every two to seven years in varying intensity, and the waters of the eastern Pacific can be up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) warmer than usual. El Niño, which in Spanish means ""little boy,"" is the opposite of the La Niña, or ""little girl,"" climate pattern. El Niño offers a global study in opposites  A strong El Niño heats up the atmosphere and changes circulation patterns around the globe. It can especially affect the jet stream -- a narrow band of strong wind in the upper atmosphere -- over the Pacific, which gets stronger and dumps more frequent and intense storms over the western US, especially California, and along South America's west coast. The atmosphere, however, is something of a zero-sum game: More rain in North and South America falls at the expense of normally rainy southern Asia and Australia, which in turn can experience droughts. El Niño has been known to cause intense flooding across eastern sections of Africa -- leading to landslides, an increase in waterborne diseases and even food shortages -- while northern and southern parts of the continent experience severe drought.  A strong El Niño also influences cyclone seasons around the planet. The warmer the Pacific is, the more hurricanes or typhoons it gets -- while fewer hurricanes form in Atlantic Ocean because increased upper-level winds prevent them from developing. This happened during the 2015 hurricane season, with the Pacific breaking records while the Atlantic seeing a relatively quiet year.  It can affect US rainfall -- and Pacific fish Like snowflakes, no two El Niños are exactly alike. For instance, an area of warmer water in the northern Pacific that became known as ""the blob"" during the 2014-2016 El Niño event wasn't there during the 1997 El Niño.  But during typical El Niño years, more rain falls in the southwestern and southeastern United States, while the North experiences much drier and warmer weather. And weather isn't the only thing El Niño affects. Warmer surface waters in the eastern Pacific drive away cold-water fish that are the backbone of the fishing industry in much of Latin America. In fact, fishermen there first noticed the phenomenon and named it ""little boy"" or ""Christ child"" in Spanish, since it often appeared around Christmas. Its climate crisis impact is under review The influence of the climate crisis on El Niño is still a matter of debate.  Climate change could make El Niños' impact worse, some recent studies show. And while the overall number of El Niños is unlikely to increase as the planet warms, amplified, so-called ""super"" El Niños will be twice as likely, other research suggests. Among the most likely byproducts of global warming are more extreme precipitation events because warmer temperatures can hold more water vapor in the atmosphere. That could make El Niño-induced floods even more devastating.

                      The Atlantic hurricane season doesn't officially begin for another seven weeks, but early signs indicate there is more uncertainty than normal with this particular season -- all thanks to El Niño. Colorado State University released its 2023 Atlantic hurricane season forecast on Thursday morning and is predicting 13 named storms, six hurricanes and two major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). Each of these numbers is slightly below the typical season average of 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. ""We anticipate that the 2023 Atlantic basin hurricane season will have slightly below-average activity,"" said Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at CSU.  ""Current neutral ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) conditions look fairly likely to transition to El Niño this summer/fall. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to how strong an El Niño would be, if it does develop."" Klotzbach says that one of those factors leading to uncertainty is sea surface temperatures in the eastern and central Atlantic. Sea surface temperatures are one of the ingredients needed to fuel hurricanes. The warmer the ocean, the more fuel available for the storms to tap into. And currently, sea surface temperatures are much warmer than normal, which means, even if El Niño does develop, the potential still exists for a busy Atlantic hurricane season. While CSU's forecast calls for slightly below-average numbers overall, the odds of a US landfall appear to be as high as in any normal year.  ""We anticipate a near-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean,"" Klotzbach said. ""As is the case with all hurricane seasons, coastal residents are reminded that it only takes one hurricane making landfall to make it an active season for them. They should prepare the same for every season, regardless of how much activity is predicted."" The biggest factor this year will definitely be El Niño.  ""How quickly El Niño sets in could have significant impacts on how hurricane season unfolds, as it is one of the primary weather patterns affecting tropical seasons in the Atlantic and Pacific,"" said CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller. ""You can't accurately predict this hurricane season without accurately predicting when and how intense El Niño will get by this fall."" It all comes down to El Niño El Niño traditionally inhibits hurricane activity, whereas La Niña or ENSO neutral conditions create a more favorable environment for tropical storm development. The Climate Prediction Center issued an El Niño Watch on Thursday morning, indicating there is a 62% chance of El Niño developing during May-July 2023. The exact timing of El Nino formation will be key, as well as how robust this particular El Niño becomes.  ""El Niño tends to have its strongest impacts on hurricanes forming in the deep tropics,"" Klotzbach said. ""So, Caribbean storms tend to really get knocked down in El Niño years, due to increases in vertical wind shear."" But systems that form in different areas of the Atlantic (tropical regions versus higher latitudes) are affected differently by El Niño.   ""That is why we tend to find a strong reduction of hurricanes making landfall in Florida and along the East Coast in El Niño years, especially when the El Niño is fairly strong."" But this isn't the case for all areas of the US coastline. Klotzbach cautions that the reduction of storm activity along the Gulf Coast is actually weaker.  ""While Gulf landfalling hurricanes can come from either tropical Atlantic or Caribbean storms, these systems can also form in ... the Gulf of Mexico from entities like cold fronts. These systems don't appear to have much modulation by El Niño/La Niña."" Even if the season does end up below average, at the end of the day, it only takes one landfalling storm to be impactful. ""I think it's important to convey that seasonal forecasts in April always have lots of uncertainty, but this one has even more uncertainty than normal given the potential combination of a robust El Niño but also a very warm tropical Atlantic,"" said Klotzbach. In fact, Klotzbach points out that some weather forecast models are predicting the warmest August-September values on record for both the tropical eastern and central Pacific and tropical/subtropical Atlantic basins. ""Typically we say that a strong El Niño trumps a warm Atlantic, but it's unclear exactly how strong El Niño would be and how warm the tropical Atlantic is going to be.""

                      The European Space Agency is about to send a spacecraft to explore Jupiter and three of its largest and most intriguing moons. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission, or Juice, was expected to lift off Thursday at 8:15 a.m. ET aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. But a lightning risk postponed the launch, which has been rescheduled for Friday at 8:14 a.m. ET. Watch the launch live on ESA's website or YouTube channel. Weather can often cause launch delays and postponements. Specific weather criteria must be met in order for rockets to safely lift off. The James Webb Space Telescope, which launched aboard an Ariane 5 from the same location in December 2021, also faced similar delays due to adverse weather conditions around Kourou. Once launched, the spacecraft will separate from the Ariane 5 launcher after 28 minutes. Over the course of the next 17 days, Juice will deploy its solar arrays, antennas and other instruments, followed by three months of testing and preparing the instruments. Juice will take eight years to reach Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. During its lengthy cruise, the spacecraft will utilize some gravitational slingshots as it flies by Earth, our moon and Venus to help with the journey. INTERACTIVE: The search for life in our solar system Once Juice arrives at Jupiter in July 2031, the spacecraft will spend about three and a half years orbiting the gas giant and conducting flybys of three of its moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. Toward the end of the mission, Juice will focus solely on orbiting Ganymede, making it the first spacecraft to ever orbit a moon in the outer solar system. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa are ice-covered worlds that may contain subsurface oceans that are potentially habitable for life. Meanwhile, NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launching in 2024, is expected to reach Jupiter in April 2030 and conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, eventually reaching just 16 miles (25 kilometers) above the moon's surface. Together, the two missions could unlock some of the biggest mysteries about Jupiter and its moons. Up close with the king of the solar system Exploration of Jupiter began with NASA's Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s, followed by dedicated Jupiter missions like Galileo and the Juno probe. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter and flying by some of its moons since 2016.  The Juice mission has five main objectives, including using its powerful suite of 10 instruments to characterize the three icy moons and determine whether they harbor oceans, uncover what makes Ganymede so unique and determine if the moons are potentially habitable for life.  Planetary scientists want to know how deep the oceans are, if they contain salty or fresh water and how that water interacts with the ice shell of each moon. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa also have different surfaces. Juice could reveal what kind of activity has caused some of them to look dark and cratered or paler and grooved. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, larger than Pluto and Mercury, and it's the only one that has a magnetic field similar to Earth. Juice's instruments can reveal the moon's rotation, gravity, shape, interior structure and composition and peer through its icy crust using radar. Juice will also conduct a detailed analysis of Jupiter to determine how the complex magnetic and radiation environment around this massive planet shaped its moons, as well as how Jupiter formed in the first place. Understanding more of Jupiter's origin story can help scientists apply those findings to Jupiter-like planets found outside of our solar system.  Jupiter's magnetic field is 20 times stronger than Earth's and it has a harsh radiation environment, both of which impact its moons. The Juice mission was designed to unravel what takes place as Jupiter interacts with its moons, including auroras, hot spots, radio emissions and waves of charged particles. The potential for life Although the three moons are encased in thick ice shells, interior heating could be taking place at each moon's core — and that warmth could make the interior oceans possible habitats for past or existing life. Juice can search the moons for evidence of the building blocks of life, including elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron and magnesium. Previous missions like Galileo and Cassini, which visited Saturn and its moons, confirmed that liquid water can be found on planets and moons far away from the sun — and that water is likely to exist under the surface.  ""I think Juice is a confirmation that our understanding of where to search for potential habitability has changed in the last 20 years,"" said Michele Dougherty, Royal Society research professor at Imperial College London and principal investigator of Juice's magnetometer.  Life as we understand it on Earth requires liquid water, a heat source and organic material — ""and then you need those first three ingredients to be stable enough over a long enough period of time that something can actually happen,"" Dougherty said.  ""With Juice, we want to confirm there's liquid water in these moons, confirm their heat sources. Other instruments will be able to remotely sense whether there's organic material on the surface as well.  And so it's putting all of those ingredients together,"" she said.  Surviving Jupiter Juice's truck-size spacecraft has been designed to survive a long journey to Jupiter — and it has to survive the extremes of the gas giant's environment once it arrives. Two cross-shaped solar arrays will provide the spacecraft with power and lead-lined vaults protect its most sensitive electronics. The ESA-led mission includes contributions from NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. Testing and modeling of Jupiter's radiation belts allowed engineers to prepare for what Juice will encounter. ""A key achievement of this model for us was to show that what at first seemed to be a dangerous place was not completely out of reach,"" said Christian Erd, Juice spacecraft and system manager, in a statement. ""Around three and a half years at Jupiter will involve the equivalent radiation exposure of a telecommunications satellite in geostationary Earth orbit for 20 years — which we have plenty of experience in managing.""  In order to help Juice survive, its trajectory was designed to fly past Callisto 21 times but only swing by Europa twice. Europa is the closest to Jupiter and sits well within its radiation halo. Just two orbits of the moon will cause the spacecraft to experience a third of its overall radiation exposure. Some of Juice's instruments are shielded, while others will be exposed to the elements to probe the atmospheres of Jupiter and its moons. Multiple imagers and sensors will capture and send back data across different wavelengths of light. Given the eventual distance between the spacecraft and Earth, it will take 45 minutes to send a one-way signal to Juice. But that's nothing compared to the years-long wait for Juice to arrive at Jupiter.  Scientists are already anticipating the unique data Juice will return. ""I think the most critical time is the first flyby we have of Ganymede,"" Dougherty said. ""The first one or two flybys is when we are going to confirm the existence of an ocean.""

                      Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. A British visa plan to attract investment was used by 10 Russian oligarchs placed under sanctions to get residency, according to a review from the UK Home Office on Thursday.  Home Secretary Suella Braverman said a small minority who had used the visa route ""were potentially at high risk of having obtained wealth through corruption or other illicit financial activity, and /or being engaged in serious and organized crime."" Braverman said the 10 Russian oligarchs who used the visa scheme were sanctioned after the invasion of Ukraine. The secretary made the disclosure in a statement Thursday at the end of a long-awaited review into the so-called “golden visa” scheme for high-net-worth individuals. She also said that ""the UK's openness to global business carries risks that malign actors will take advantage of our systems to pursue corrupt and criminal ends. We must ensure that kleptocracies such as Russia are not able to act with impunity overseas."" Braverman said that since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, the UK has placed sanctions on 1,200 individuals and 120 entities linked to the Russian state and frozen $22 billion in Russian assets. Some background: The Tier 1 Investor visa route, often referred to as ""the golden visa,"" was introduced in 2008 to encourage wealthy people outside the European Union to invest in the UK. It was shut down last year. A review of the visa scheme was commissioned in 2018 by the then-Home Secretary Amber Rudd following the Salisbury poisonings. The nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skirpal and his daughter resulted in the death of a woman. In response to the review, Braverman said that ""the Government is clear that any future visa route to facilitate investment-based migration must not offer entry solely on the basis of the applicant's personal wealth."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in his daily address thanked the Ukrainian soldiers defending the eastern town of Soledar from a Russian assault. “Especially today I would like to highlight the paratroopers of the 77th separate airmobile brigade, who along with the fighters of the 46th separate airmobile brigade in Soledar hold their positions and inflict significant losses on the enemy,” Zelensky said. “I thank you, guys!” The Ukrainian military unit stationed in Soledar said Thursday that the situation in the contested eastern town is “critical."" “The situation is critical. News coming soon,” the 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Telegram. Fighting is still raging in Soledar, a salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, despite Russian claims that it has gained control of the region. The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especially the Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer. CNN's Rob Picheta, Tim Lister and Olga Voitovych contributed to this post.  Russia’s appointment of a new head of the invasion operation of Ukraine likely reflects ""systemic challenges"" for Russia, according to a US Defense Department spokesperson  The announcement of General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, as overall commander of the campaign shows “some of the systemic challenges that the Russian military has faced since the beginning of this invasion,” Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a press briefing. “We’ve talked about some of those things in terms of its logistics problems, command and control problems, sustainment problems, morale and the largely, large failure to obtain the strategic objectives that they’ve set for themselves,” Ryder said. Ryder said the department will “continue to monitor” such Russian personnel shifts. “I think that the world would rather see Russia focus on withdrawing from Ukraine and saving innocent lives versus spending time on numerous management reshuffles, and Russian soldiers and their families would probably like to see that too,” Ryder said. Wagner, the Russian private military company, posted a video on Telegram Thursday directly disparaging the Russian Defense Ministry’s claim that regular Russian military forces have participated in the assault on Soledar.  A day after Russia’s Defense Ministry reshuffled the command of its so-called ""special military operation,"" Wagner’s post doubles down on the assertion by boss Yevgeny Prigozhin that his forces alone are responsible for the Soledar operation. The video shows two men, faces obscured, wearing fatigues and standing in what looks to be an underground bunker, illuminated by flashlight. “We are officers of the Airborne Forces, we declare that the Airborne Forces did not take part in the assault on the city of Soledar,” one man says. “The assault on the city of Soledar was carried out only by the forces of PMC Wagner. We were not even sent in that direction.” Some context: CNN is unable to verify the men’s identity or the veracity of their statement, but the fact that Wagner posted it at all is significant. Which Russian forces are responsible for the assault in eastern Ukraine has become a key point of contention in the machinations of Russia’s power structure. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that regular Russian forces were operating in and around Soledar, without mentioning Wagner. Prigozhin, in a statement published on a Wagner Telegram channel Monday, called any claim that non-Wagner forces participated in the Soledar assault “fake information.” In a visit to his forces near Bakhmut over New Year’s Eve, Prigozhin directly castigated Kremlin bureaucrats. “Once we conquer our internal bureaucracy and corruption, then we will conquer the Ukrainians and NATO, and then the whole world,"" Prigozhin told his fighters in a video posted to Telegram. Some pro-Kremlin Russian military bloggers have speculated that the Russian Defense Ministry’s announcement of Valery Gerasimov as its new commander was motivated in part by Wagner’s success. On the ground in Soledar: The Ukrainian military insisted Thursday that the town is still contested, and that its forces were even “conducting counterattacks” in the settlement. A video posted to Telegram Thursday evening shows forces from Wagner in the town. The video has been geolocated by CNN to the northern edge of the town, towards Russian-controlled territory. ""The situation in Soledar is still not easy,” a Wagner fighter says in the video. ""The enemy does not reveal themselves because of the artillery fire, but it's obvious that we've decimated them.” CNN's Josh Pennington contributed reporting to this post.  A Ukrainian soldier in the contested eastern town of Soledar described a dire situation to CNN on Thursday evening, saying “we are just abandoned.” CNN is not identifying the soldier for security reasons. “We tried to withdraw ourselves, but the Orcs [Russians] are already there. If there is no order to withdraw today, we will most likely not have time to leave,” he told CNN over the phone. “We were told that we would be withdrawn. And now we аre just abandoned.” He said that the soldiers had run out of food, were running low on water, and that they had wounded soldiers. He said that they still had some ammunition. “The last evacuation was three days ago,” he said. “The order was to hold out to the very end. Judging by the sounds of the battle, our neighbors [other units] either withdrew or were ordered to withdraw. We were told to hold out.” “We hold on as long as we can. But anyone can get tired and hit the limit eventually. It is impossible to hold on just on a high morale for so long.” Wagner, the Russian private military company, has claimed to have captured all of Soledar. A video posted to Telegram Thursday and geolocated by CNN shows Wagner forces on the northern edge of the town. Ukraine’s 46th Airmobile Brigade claimed Thursday that it was “conducting counterattacks” in the town. “After several days of pulling back, we've even made a small advance,” the unit said on Telegram. “The railway station is ours. The mine is ours. We are waiting for support. Soledar is Ukraine.” A Ukrainian official said Thursday that Russia is stepping up its “illegal integration” of occupied territory into Russia. “They began to replace driver's licenses with Russian ones and issue Russian license plates with a numeric indication of the Russian region,” Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. “The occupiers announced that it will be prohibited to operate vehicles, including personal ones, without meeting these conditions, and in case of violation they can be seized.” Maliar also claimed that Russian forces were forcibly evicting locals from homes in order to house military forces. Spain will receive 225 Ukrainian troops late on Thursday at an air force base near Madrid, including 20 who will get training on HAWK air defense systems to counter air attacks, Spain's Defense Ministry said in a statement. Spain is sending six of the HAWK air defense units to Ukraine.  Most of the remaining troops, who are Ukrainian civilians without prior military experience, will get basic training, the defense ministry said. That will include training on treating people wounded in combat and on procedures against IEDs. The training in Toledo, an hour south of Madrid, is a program designed to handle 400 Ukrainian troops rotating through every two months and is part of the European Union's military assistance mission for Ukraine, the ministry said. It is the second group of Ukrainian troops to come to Spain for training after 64 troops came in November and December, the statement added. Spain's Defense Minister will receive the 225 Ukrainian troops at Torrejón Air Base, according to the ministry.  Other allies' actions: Polish President Andrzej Duda announced a plan to send Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Lviv on Wednesday.  And Ukrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the United States as soon as next week, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday. The Ukrainian military said Thursday that it was conducting counterattacks in Soledar, the eastern town that has been the subject of intense Russian bombardment. “After several days of pulling back, we've even made a small advance,” Ukraine's 46th Airmobile Brigade said on Telegram. “The railway station is ours. The mine is ours. We are waiting for support. Soledar is Ukraine.” Russia is trying to surround nearby Bakhmut using both Wagner private contractors and regular military personnel, Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, said on Telegram. “Our soldiers bravely hold their positions and inflict numerous losses on the enemy,” she said. Why Soledar is important to Russia: The town of Soledar, located in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, has been a target for Russian forces since last May. With a pre-war population of about 10,000, it has little strategic value in itself, but is a waypoint in the Russians’ attritional slog westward. Moscow has struggled for months to attack Bakhmut from the east. Were it to capture Soledar, Russian forces would at least be able to approach the city from a different path. As Ukrainian officials say ""fierce battles"" continue to rage in Soledar, a key town in eastern Ukraine, satellite images show just how much destruction has been inflicted on the area since summer.   Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempt to take Soledar, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Mailar. On Tuesday, the Wagner mercenary group claimed it had taken complete control of the town, but Ukraine refutes that claim. Russian forces have fought hard to take Soledar, but more battles remain, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. Over 500 civilians remain in Soledar, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration. Here's a look at before-and-after satellite images of the town: Why Russia wants to capture Soledar: The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and they've had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive. The Institute for the Study of War says control of Soledar “will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,” the larger prize. A top pro-Kremlin military blogger suggested Thursday that the appointment of a new commander for Russia’s so-called ""special military operation"" in Ukraine was a canny move designed to “stop blurring responsibility” for the war effort, and prevent the Russian General Staff from blaming “the generals in the field.”  Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the alias WarGonzo, was personally awarded by President Vladimir Putin with the “Order of Courage” on Dec. 20. The appointment of Valery Gerasimov as commander of the war effort means that Russia’s General Staff will no longer be able to say “it was the generals in the field who failed,” Pegov opined on his Telegram channel. “It is an obvious step to stop blurring responsibility for certain episodes related to the Special Military Operation.” The fact that Gerasimov is chief of the General Staff of the Army means that “the General Staff is now one of those ‘generals in the field,’” Pegov said. “The situation in which this or that local victory has a thousand fathers, and a defeat has the one who is blamed for it, no longer works. The General Staff is now directly and uncompromisingly responsible for absolutely everything,"" he added.  Pegov also said that he did not believe that Sergei Surovikin’s move from commander to deputy commander represented a demotion, but rather a move to better insulate him from politics. “Strictly speaking he was subordinated to Gerasimov anyway and had to agree his every move with the General Staff. Now ‘General Armageddon’ [Surovikin] is still in the center of decision-making, but in a much less vulnerable staff position. His authority in the troops is still at a high level, and the commanders and soldiers in the trenches still believe in him and trust him, and are ready to follow him further,"" he said.  More on Russia's former commander in Ukraine: Surovikin, who had been appointed to the role on Oct. 8, 2022, and was in charge of Russian forces during their retreat from large swaths of Ukraine’s Kherson region. An American Navy veteran who has been detained in Russia for nearly a year was released from Russian custody on Thursday, his family's spokesperson told CNN, after months of negotiations spearheaded by former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson.  Taylor Dudley, 35, of Lansing, Michigan, was detained by Russian border patrol police in April 2022 after crossing from Poland into Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave between Poland and Lithuania. He was in Poland attending a music festival, and it is not clear why he crossed the border.   Dudley's detention — which the US government had not deemed as ""wrongful,"" or based on arbitrary and discriminatory motivations — had not been widely publicized before Thursday because his family wanted the negotiations for his release to remain private.  The Richardson Center for Global Engagement, a nonprofit founded by Richardson, spearheaded the negotiations, family spokesperson Jonathan Franks told CNN. The former governor and diplomat has long worked to free Americans detained abroad, and his center played a role in securing the release of Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former Marine who had been wrongfully detained in Russia, last summer.  The Steve Menzies Global Foundation and the US Embassy also helped to secure Dudley's release, the spokesperson said.  ""Earlier today, Russian authorities released American Citizen Taylor Dudley, a 35-year-old Navy veteran, across the Polish border to Gov. Bill Richardson, his team, and a representative from the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, a release the Richardson Center worked on diligently and quietly for more than 6 months with significant assistance from the Steve Menzies Global Foundation, from Hostage U.S., and from the James Foley Foundation. The family will be forever grateful for the work of all three.” ""The past 9 months have been difficult ones for the family and they ask the media to respect their privacy and give them the space to welcome Taylor home,"" he added. In a separate statement to CNN, Richardson said Dudley had been released at the Russia-Poland Bagrationovsk-Bezledy border crossing on Thursday, after nearly a year of negotiations. He also acknowledged the involvement of the State Department and the US Embassies in Moscow and Warsaw in helping to secure Dudley’s release.  “After six months of intensive work, it's great to see this release of Taylor Dudley happen,” Richardson told CNN by phone on Thursday. “We worked it hard in Moscow and Kaliningrad and first raised it during our meetings with Russian officials on Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed.”  Several US citizens remain detained in Russia, including former US Marine Paul Whelan, who is designated as wrongfully detained. He was arrested in Russia in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison. In 2022, the US proposed trading Whelan and American basketball star Brittney Griner in a prisoner swap for arms dealer Viktor Bout, but Russia only agreed to release Griner. CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. A day after Poland’s president expressed his intention to send German-manufactured battle tanks to Ukraine, Germany’s vice chancellor has suggested that his country will not block the weapons transfer. “Germany should not stand in the way of other countries taking decisions to support Ukraine, independent of which decisions Germany takes,” Robert Habeck said on the sidelines of a Greens Party meeting in Berlin. It would be the first time a Western-made tank has been sent to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. Because the Leopard tank is German-manufactured, its re-export would typically need the approval of the German government. Steffen Hebestreit, spokesperson for the German federal government, said Wednesday that he was “not aware of any specific inquiries” from foreign governments about re-exporting Leopard tanks. Polish President Andrzej Duda on Wednesday cautioned during a news conference in Lviv, Ukraine, that “a whole range of formal requirements, approvals and so on must also be met.” The German government has also come under pressure from Ukrainian officials to itself export battle tanks to Ukraine. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht on Thursday did not rule out that possibility. “In the times in which we live – in which we are facing many great challenges in the face of a war in Europe – we are well-advised to always adapt to the respective situation,” Lambrecht said. “There is no decision in the federal government to hand over battle tanks."" Nonetheless, she said that they would “not rule anything out” and that Germany would make decisions “together with its allies.” Other allies' actions: The British government is working with partners to discuss how to go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine, including the provision of tanks, according to the prime minister's spokesperson on Wednesday. And Ukrainian troops are set to begin training on the Patriot missile system in the United States as soon as next week, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday. A top Ukrainian military official said Thursday that Russia’s appointment of a new military commander shows that its war in Ukraine is not going to plan. “Since the first days of the war, we have been observing the periodic changes in the leadership of the armed forces of the occupying country,” Oleksii Hromov, deputy chief of the General Staff’s main operational directorate, said during a press briefing. “If everything was in order, the personnel changes would not take place with such frequency.” “The latest personnel changes, first of all, indicate that there is a need to combine the management system and the command and control system of the troops in their ranks. Not everything works out the way they want. How it will be further — we will see.” More on the appointment:  Russia’s Defense Ministry announced Wednesday that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, would become the overall commander of the campaign, with the current commander, Sergey Surovikin, becoming one of his three deputies.Surovikin was only appointed as the overall commander of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls the “Special Military Operation” in October. CNN's Tim Lister contributed reporting to this post.  Oleksii Hromov, the deputy chief of Ukraine's General Staff’s main operational directorate, declined to discuss percentages when referring to Ukrainian control of the eastern town of Soledar. Hromov said “regarding Soledar. There are fierce battles. It is inappropriate to estimate in percentage terms what part of the city we control, what part of the city the enemy is trying to control. Battles are going on, fierce battles.” During recent days, there has been conflicting language about who controls the Donetsk town as battles over the area continue to unfold.  The comments from Hromov may hint at the difficult situation facing Ukrainian forces in the city, especially as Wagner forces say they control the center of the city and the Russian Armed Forces have blockaded the southern and northern routes of the town.  On Wednesday, a soldier fighting in Soledar told CNN “during these days everything will be determined for the city. Because we are being trapped, they want to encircle us,” suggesting a shrinking of territory in Ukrainian control. The importance of Soledar: The Russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of July, and have had to retreat in both Kharkiv to the north and Kherson in southern Ukraine. The capture of Soledar, despite its now-ruined state, would therefore be rare progress. But it would be symbolic rather than substantive. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says control of Soledar “will not necessarily allow Russian forces to exert control over critical Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Bakhmut,” the larger prize. CNN's Rob Picheta and Tim Lister contributed reporting to this post.  The Kremlin said Thursday it ""does not have information"" on the two UK nationals reportedly missing in Donbas in eastern Ukraine. “We know from media reports that we are talking about British citizens who were militants, took part in the hostilities with weapons in their hands. It appears that documents were found on the battlefield,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a routine conference call with reporters. The families of both men, Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Parry, say the two had gone to Ukraine to work as humanitarian volunteers. CNN has seen no evidence they participated in hostilities in Ukraine.  Peskov also said he is not aware if the British side sought help from Moscow but added “If there is a request for assistance [in finding the bodies and getting them to the UK], of course, it will be considered.”  On Thursday a Downing St spokesperson said ""the reports we have had today are deeply concerning. They have been reported by the Wagner Group as the source of that, so I would urge caution in reporting that until any such claims are verified.” Key developments in the case: On Wednesday, Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin posted a claim on his Telegram feed that his private military company Wagner found a body of one of the two missing Britons. In the post, Prigozhin’s press service said that they received a call to their hotline on Jan. 8 asking for help finding the two men.  “Today [Wednesday], one of those was found, along with documents for both,"" the post claimed. A subsequent post on the same Telegram channel published photos appearing to show two passports with the names of the missing Britons. On Jan. 9, Ukrainian police reported that they were searching for Bagshaw and Parry. Ukrainian police noted that the two Britons “left Kramatorsk for Soledar"" — the scene of intense recent fighting — ""and contact with them was lost."" The Russian Defense Ministry commission, headed by the Commander-in-Chief of Russia's ground forces Oleg Salyukov, has arrived in Belarus to inspect the Russian units of the joint forces, the Belarus Defense Ministry said in a statement Thursday.  ""The military units and subunits of the Russian component of the regional grouping of forces located at the training grounds of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus were inspected,"" the statement reads. ""In the course of the work, the quality of combat coordination classes was checked and an assessment was made of their readiness to fulfill their intended tasks in the interests of ensuring the military security of the Union State,"" reads the statement.  Salyukov is one of the three deputies of Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who has been appointed as the overall commander of what the Kremlin euphemistically calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.  The Belarus Defense Ministry declared Wednesday that the joint air defense forces of Belarus and Russia have been reinforced, according to the ministry’s press service. More on Russia-Belarus relations: Some Russian forces are based in Belarus and used its territory in the initial invasion of Ukraine in February. But President Alexander Lukashenko has gone to some lengths to ensure that Belarus troops do not become involved in Russia's ""special military operation.""  In December, Ukraine warned it does ""not rule out"" a ""deliberate provocation"" from Russia after Belarus said that the wreckage of a Ukrainian missile landed on its territory.  CNN’s Eve Brennan contributed reporting to this post.  Ukraine has contested the Wagner mercenary group's claim that it has taken control of the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, saying that Russian forces are ""suffering heavy losses"" in continued fighting there. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian defense official has said that he expects a delivery of Leopard battle tanks from Poland to arrive ""very, very fast,"" in what would be the first delivery of a Western-made tanks to Ukraine since Russia invaded almost 11 months ago. Here are the latest headlines: Ukraine says battle for Soledar continues: Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempt to take Soledar, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar. On Tuesday, the Wagner mercenary group claimed it had taken complete control of the town, but Ukraine refutes that claim. “The approaches to the city today are actually strewn with the bodies of killed Putin's troops,"" Mailar said. 
            Peskov hails Russian efforts: Russian forces have fought hard to take Soledar, but more battles remain, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. ""Enormous effort has been done in Soledar. These are absolutely selfless heroic actions. Not only in Soledar, but in many areas where offensive operations are being carried out,” said Peskov. “The main work is still ahead.""
            Ukraine claims 100 Russian casualties: Ukrainian officials have claimed that a strike on a Russian position near Soledar has killed 100 enemy soldiers. In a statement published Thursday, the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said it had detected a “concentration of the enemy,” and employed artillery and a Soviet-designed missile system to carry out the attack. CNN cannot independently verify the claim, and Kyiv did not provide any evidence of such an attack.
            More than 500 civilians remain: As the struggle for the town rages, some 523 civilians are still in Soledar, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration. Evacuation is ""just unrealistic"" at the moment, Kyrylenko added.
            Ukraine expects tanks ""very, very fast"": Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, has said that a delivery of Leopard battle tanks from Poland will arrive ""very, very fast."" Polish President Andrzej Duda announced the plan to send Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Lviv on Wednesday, but a shipment of the German-made tanks would typically require approval from Germany.
            Grenade removed from soldier's body: A Ukrainian military doctor has removed part of an undetonated grenade from the body of an injured Ukrainian soldier. An X-ray image shows the fragment lodged in the soldier's torso, while another photo shows a doctor holding the grenade.  ##Catch Up## Russian forces have fought hard to take the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, but more battles remain, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday. “Enormous effort has been done in Soledar. These are absolutely selfless heroic actions. Not only in Soledar, but in many areas where offensive operations are being carried out,” said Peskov. “The main work is still ahead,” he added. CNN asked Peskov whether the Kremlin is satisfied with the efforts of the Wagner mercenary group to take Soledar – as it has previously claimed – but the Kremlin spokesman didn't cite the private military company by name in his response. Conflicting reports are circulating about the status of Soledar. On Tuesday, Wagner claimed it is in complete control of the town, and a day later the Russian Defense Ministry said that its forces had “blocked Soledar from the northern and southern parts” of the settlement. However, on Thursday, Ukraine said that fighting continues and Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempts to take Soledar. A Ukrainian military doctor has removed part of an undetonated grenade from the body of an injured soldier, according to a Facebook post from the Ukrainian Military Medics. An X-ray image that accompanied the post showed the fragment lodged in the soldier's torso, while another photo shows a doctor holding the grenade. The grenade was removed “in the presence of two sappers who were ensuring the safety of medical staff,"" reads the post. Doctors feared that the grenade could explode at any time during the operation, and therefore the surgery was conducted “without electrocoagulation,"" an electrical medical treatment that can be used to control bleeding. The surgery was a success and the soldier was “sent for further rehabilitation,"" reads the post. The grenade was a ""VOG grenade"" and is usually fired from a grenade launcher.  Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, has spoken bullishly about the delivery of tanks from Poland.  “I am more than sure the tanks that will be provided to us, it will be very, very fast,"" said Danilov on Ukrainian television. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will “master” the use of the tanks “in a matter of weeks,"" added Danilov. Polish President Andrzej Duda announced the plan to send Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Lviv on Wednesday.  It would be the first time a Western-made tank has been sent to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion.  Duda cautioned during a press conference that “a whole range of formal requirements, approvals and so on must also be met.” The Leopard tank is manufactured in Germany and a shipment would typically require permission to re-export a German-manufactured weapon.  CNN contacted the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action for comment, but spokesman Robert Säverin referred CNN to the Polish government. Russian forces are “suffering heavy losses” in their attempt to take the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Mailar. “The approaches to the city today are actually strewn with the bodies of killed Putin's troops,"" she said. Mailar added that the fighting in the town is “fierce” and described Ukrainian soldiers as “fighting desperately,” but showing “maximum resilience and heroism."" The area around Soledar has seen intense fighting in recent days. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russian private military company Wagner, claimed Tuesday that his forces had taken control of the “entire territory of Soledar.”  But Mailar denied that was the case Wednesday afternoon. More than 500 civilians remain in Soledar as Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to struggle for control of the city, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration.  Speaking on Ukrainian television on Thursday morning, Kyrylenko said that “as of now, there are 523 people there.""  Most of the people left are over 50 years' old, he added, with ""no information"" that children are among their number.  ""It will not be correct if I say that they do not want to leave now. We are doing our best to help people to leave,” said Kyrylenko, adding that evacuation is ""just unrealistic"" at the moment. Evacuations will resume “when I know it is possible to get there by special transport and leave from there,"" he said. Russia claims to have made advances on Soledar in recent days, amid some of the fiercest fighting of the war.  Ukrainian officials have claimed that a strike on a Russian position near the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine has killed 100 enemy soldiers. In a statement published Thursday, the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said it had detected a “concentration of the enemy,” and employed artillery and a Soviet-designed missile system to carry out the attack. “As a result of these several strikes, the destruction of more than 100 occupiers, two machine gun crews and two mortar crews was confirmed,” Ukraine’s military stated, praising the work of its “Special Forces warriors, artillerymen and rocketeers.” CNN cannot independently verify the claim, and Kyiv did not provide any evidence of such an attack. In recent weeks Ukraine has claimed a number of attacks which it says have killed large numbers of Russian soldiers. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said around 500 Russian troops were either killed or wounded in a hit near Chulakivka, a town in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, on New Year's Eve.  CNN cannot independently verify that Ukrainian claim and Moscow has not publicly commented on it. However both Ukraine and Russia acknowledged a strike that took place just after midnight on New Year’s Day on a vocational school housing Russian conscripts in Makiivka, eastern Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense reported 89 Russian servicemen were killed in the strike, whereas the Ukrainian military reported higher figures, initially claiming up to around 400 Russian soldiers were killed. CNN cannot independently verify either side’s reported death toll, but that strike appears to be one of the deadliest episodes of the conflict for Moscow’s forces. Russian war crimes and human rights abuses during the war in Ukraine add up to a “litany of violations of international humanitarian law,” according to Human Rights Watch. In the rights group’s annual report reviewing human rights standards in nearly 100 countries, it said that evidence of war crimes in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, are part of a pattern that “has been repeated countless times.” HRW’s World Report 2023 also highlights the bombing of a theater in Mariupol, despite signs warning that children were sheltering there, as well as strikes on other non-military targets. “Inflicting civilian suffering, such as the repeated strikes on the energy infrastructure that Ukrainians depend on for electricity, water, and heat, seems to be a central part of the Kremlin’s strategy,” reads the report.

Some background: Soledar, a salt mine town in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, has been the site of intense fighting in recent days and a target for Russian forces since last May. The head of Russia's private military company claimed Tuesday that his forces had taken control of the ""entire territory of Soledar,"" but Kyiv officials deny the claim, insisting that the fight persists. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday that Russia sees its attempted capture of Soledar as a propaganda tool with which to maintain domestic support for its war. Should Russian troops indeed capture the town, it would mark Moscow's first gain in the Donbas for months —  potentially offering President Vladimir Putin some welcome news after a string of defeats on the battlefield since last summer. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced yet another realignment of the commanders leading the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, as criticism mounts over its handling of the stalled campaign. It said that Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, would become the overall commander of the campaign, with the current commander, Sergey Surovikin, becoming one of his three deputies. Surovikin was only appointed as the overall commander of the what the Kremlin euphemistically calls the “Special Military Operation” in October. In terms of the bureaucratic hierarchy, the announcement is hardly an upheaval. Surovikin already reported to Gerasimov. “Generals are moved, shuffled from the Front to the Headquarters. From Headquarters to the Front,” Russian television commentator Sergey Markov said Wednesday on Telegram.
            “Surovikin is not punished and Gerasimov is not punished. It’s all one team. Well, of course with competition, which always happens among the top dogs.” But the decision puts Gerasimov, who has been chief of the General Staff for more than a decade, closer to direct supervision of the campaign — and to responsibility for it. While Gerasimov was a key figure in planning the invasion, he appears to have been at arms’ length since, with just one reported visit to the command of the campaign inside Ukraine, though the Defense Ministry did not confirm that either. Mark Galeotti, senior associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute, said “it is a kind of demotion [for Gerasimov] or at least the most poisoned of chalices. It’s now on him, and I suspect Putin has unrealistic expectations again.” Read the full analysis here. The British government is working with partners to discuss how to go ""further and faster"" in supporting Ukraine, including the provision of tanks, according to the prime minister's spokesperson on Wednesday.  When asked by lobby journalists if the United Kingdom would supply tanks to Ukraine, the prime minister's spokesperson said, “We are accelerating our support to Ukraine with the kind of next-generation military technology that will help them win this war.""  ""It is clear that tanks could provide a game-changing capability to the Ukrainians and the prime minister told President Zelensky last week that we’ll provide whatever support we can,"" the spokesperson added. ""The prime minister has asked the Defence Secretary to work with partners in the coming weeks to discuss how we can go further and faster on our support to Ukraine including the provision of tanks."" But, while it is ""constantly looking at what equipment we can provide,"" that does not mean that any decisions have been made about providing Challenger 2 tanks right now, the spokesperson said. A Ukrainian soldier in the contested eastern town of Soledar told CNN Wednesday evening that he and his comrades remained in the settlement, but the situation was “very difficult” and the next 24 hours or so would be critical. “It is tough here, but we are more alive than anyone else,” the soldier, whom CNN is not identifying for security reasons, said via text message. The head of Wagner, the Russian private military company, claimed Tuesday that his forces had taken control of the “entire territory of Soledar.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tempered that sentiment on Wednesday, saying only there was a “positive trend.” The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that its forces had “blocked Soledar from the northern and southern parts” of the settlement. “Don't believe what they say,” the Ukrainian soldier told CNN. “We're hanging in there. Though practically on our own. Without commanders.” He said that the next 24 hours would be “very difficult.” “During these days everything will be determined for the city. Because we are being trapped, they want to encircle us,"" he said. The soldier said that if the nearby Ukrainian units held their ground, his unit would be able to safely retreat. He said the Russians were jamming Ukrainian communications, making coordination extremely difficult. “It is not clear who our neighbors are, but someone is there and fighting. We have no connection with them,"" the solider said. Fighting is still raging in Soledar, a salt mine town in eastern Ukraine, despite Russian claims that it has gained control of the region. Should Russian troops indeed capture the town, it would mark Moscow’s first gain in the Donbas for months — potentially offering President Vladimir Putin some welcome news after a string of defeats on the battlefield since last summer. The significance of Soledar in military terms is minimal. However, its capture would allow Russian forces, and especially the Wagner mercenary group, to turn their focus on nearby Bakhmut, which has been a target since the summer. Taking Soledar would also represent a symbolic PR win for the man who runs Wagner — oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has frequently criticized the Russian Defense Ministry’s management of the “Special Military Operation” in Ukraine. Read more about Soledar here. Russia’s defense minister has appointed Gen. Valery Gerasimov as commander of the Joint Group of Forces leading the country's so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine. Gerasimov replaces Gen. Sergei Surovikin, who had been appointed to the role on Oct. 8, 2022, and was in charge of Russian forces during their retreat from large swaths of Ukraine’s Kherson region. Surovikin will now serve as a deputy commander, according to a statement from the Russian Defense Ministry. “On 11 January 2023, Russian Defence Minister General of the Army Sergei Shoigu assigns new leadership of special military operation,” the ministry said Wednesday on its official Telegram channel.  “Chief of General Staff General of the Army Valery Gerasimov has been assigned the commander of the Joint Group of Forces,” it said. “The deputy commanders are: the Commander-in-Chief of Aerospace Forces General of the Army Sergei Surovikin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army General of the Army Oleg Salyukov, as well as the Deputy Chief of General Staff of Russian Armed Forces Colonel General Aleksey Kim,” it added. The ministry said the changes were necessary because of “the amplified range of tasks, the necessity of closer cooperation between services and branches of the Armed Forces, as well as of improving the quality of all types of maintenance and efficiency of commanding the groups of forces.”

                      Leaked Pentagon documents suggest Russian government infighting over Ukraine

                      A fresh leak of classified US intelligence documents suggests broad infighting between Russian officials, including some within the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry, the New York Times reported Thursday.  CNN has not independently verified the documents. The NYT said it had shown the new 27-pages of documents to multiple US officials, who did not dispute the information but ""could not, and would not, independently verify the documents."" CNN has contacted the Pentagon for comment. The US has said that the first set of documents released last week were authentic but has said that some of the documents were not legitimate and had been altered.  The NYT report says the documents, which it reports were posted on one of the Discord servers, show infighting between the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Defense Ministry over Russia's casualty count for the war in Ukraine.  The new documents also indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin called Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to a meeting, believed to have taken place on February 22, to likely resolve a public dispute over ammunition supply, the NYT reports.  Prigozhin had accused Russia's defense establishment of creating ""major problems"" with ammunition supplies for his troops.  He went as far as accusing the leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry of ""treason"" for failing to get ammunition to Wagner fighters and ""also not helping with air transport."" On February 23, CNN reported Prigozhin said that a shipment of ammunition was now on its way to his fighters, in a message and voice note published on his Telegram channel. The NYT report says the documents detail US monitoring of Russian intelligence and apparatus and military command. The original batch of highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks and reported on by CNN also revealed the degree to which the US has penetrated the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Wagner Group, largely through intercepted communications and human sources, which could now be cut off or put in danger.  The Kremlin said it doubts the ""reliability"" of reports of broad infighting between Russian officials, in response to a CNN question about the NYT article.  ""I don't know what these reports [of infighting] are based on, but I'm doubting their reliability and the author's understanding of the essence of what is happening inside Russia,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. The leaks on social media in recent weeks have flustered US officials, who fear the revelations about how Washington spies on allies and foes alike could put sensitive sources at risk, and compromise important foreign relationships.  Several of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, disclose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. Others divulge significant weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces prepare to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians -- and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the person behind the massive leak worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances. CNN could not verify the article independently.  The Pentagon has also stood up an ""interagency effort"" to assess the impact of the leak, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Sunday, while the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the leaks last week.

                      Fear and confusion in Japan's Hokkaido as North Korean missile triggers evacuation order

                      A North Korean missile sparked fear on the Japanese northern island of Hokkaido Thursday after the government's emergency alert system warned residents to take cover. Millions of people received a J-alert, or evacuation order, shortly before 8 a.m., urging them to seek shelter as the missile could land on or near the island. But soon after, fear turned into anger and confusion as the evacuation order was lifted amid reports that it had been sent in error, with local officials saying there was no possibility of the missile hitting the island and Tokyo later confirming it had fallen outside Japanese territory, in waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Many residents were critical of the decision to send the alert. ""What is the use of the J-Alert, which warns of a missile falling when you do not know where it will fall?"" asked one Twitter user. ""In the end, it serves no purpose other than to instill in the Japanese people the feeling that Japan is being targeted, and to scare them."" Another Twitter user said that even had the alert been warranted there would have been too little time to find shelter. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno defended the government's response at a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday, but admitted ""We did not correct the information issued by the J-Alert."" He said the alert was ""appropriate"" given the limited information available at the time and said the government had updated the alert once it was determined the missile would not fall near Hokkaido. This is not the first time there have been issues with the J-Alerts. Last October, Japan apologized for the malfunctioning of the early warning system when residents in nine of Tokyo's island towns and villages were mistakenly sent alerts. On that occasion, North Korea had fired a ballistic missile, but it did not pass over the communities who received the alerts. The latest alarm came after North Korea fired what appeared to be a mid or longer range ballistic missile from an area near Pyongyang, at around 7:23 a.m. local time Thursday, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The White House said it ""strongly condemns"" the missile test. ""This launch is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions and needlessly raises tensions and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""The door has not closed on diplomacy, but Pyongyang must immediately cease its destabilizing actions and instead choose diplomatic engagement.  The United States will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and Republic of Korea and Japanese allies,"" Watson added.  The South Korean military believes Pyongyang was testing a new ballistic missile, which it had showcased in a military parade, according to a military official. That missile could be solid-fueled, a type of missile that can be launched more quickly and moved around more easily than the liquid-fueled long-range missiles North Korea has tested in the past. The official added that there is a possibility that North Korea was testing a part of a reconnaissance satellite, such as a sensor. North Korea said last year that it would finish preparations to launch a military reconnaissance satellite by this month. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched at a lofted trajectory, flying about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles). Meanwhile, Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said the missile may have been a type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the longest range of North Korea's ballistic missiles, but that Japanese authorities were continuing to analyze details. Hamada added that the missile fell into waters outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Chief Cabinet Secretary Matsuno called the launch ""an outrageous act that escalates provocations against the entire international community. ""North Korea's series of actions, including its repeated launches of ballistic missiles, is a threat to Japan, the region and the world,"" Matsuno said. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launch a ""significant act of provocation"" and urged Pyongyang to immediately stop, reiterating that ballistic missile launches are in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Thursday's launch marked the 12th day this year when North Korea has fired at least one missile.

                      Former J-pop star alleges sexual abuse by late Japanese music mogul Johnny Kitagawa

                      A former J-pop star trainee came forward with allegations Wednesday that he and multiple other young men were sexually abused by the late Johnny Kitagawa, once a powerful figure in Japan's entertainment industry.  Japanese-Brazilian singer-songwriter Kauan Okamoto alleged during a press conference that over the course of four years, beginning in 2012 when he was 15, he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Kitagawa, who died age 87 in 2019. Okamoto said the abuse happened when he would stay overnight at one of Kitagawa's penthouse apartments in Tokyo, often with other young aspiring musicians who were also signed to Kitagawa's talent agency, Johnny & Associates. Okamoto made the allegations during a press conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan Wednesday, saying he was speaking out now in the hope that other alleged victims will come forward.  During his long career, Kitagawa headed Japan's biggest talent agency and was known for manufacturing popular boy-bands and launching the music and acting careers of teen idols. He was a powerful and influential figure in the media and entertainment industries for decades. Johnny & Associates sent a statement to CNN Thursday in response to the allegations. ""Since shifting to a new management team upon the death of our former President in 2019, we have made it our utmost priority to adapt to the changing environment by establishing transparency in our organizational structure and policies in a manner that evokes social trust,"" the statement said. ""In January 2023, we announced measures that will ensure strict compliance with laws and regulations without exception by both management and employees as well as the steps we are taking to strengthen corporate governance by consulting with impartial third party experts,"" it continued, without directly addressing the allegations. There have been long-standing allegations against Kitagawa. In 1999, Japanese magazine Shukan Bunshun published accounts of other young men and boys who claimed they were sexually abused by Kitagawa. He sued the magazine for libel and was awarded damages, according to local media. A Tokyo High Court partially overturned the earlier decision in 2003, ruling the published sexual abuse claims were not libelous. An appeal brought by Kitagawa was later dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2005. Kitagawa was never charged over the allegations. He had reportedly denied all accusations when he was alive.  They 'knew it was my turn' Singer-songwriter Okamoto joined Kitagawa's agency in February 2012 while he was in junior high school. He became a member of Johnny's Juniors, a J-pop trainee talent pool set up by Kitagawa for young hopefuls trying to make it in the industry.  Okamoto said Kitagawa would often invite these young recruits to spend the night in his apartment, and pick ""favorites"" among the boys. He told reporters that when Kitagawa told him ""you should go to bed early,"" the other Juniors ""knew that it was my turn."" He claims the first time Kitagawa sexually assaulted him was in March 2012. That day work had finished late and he stayed at Kitagawa's place with other Juniors. Okamoto said he had heard from other boys that Kitagawa would be ""in a very bad mood the next day if you didn't go to sleep in his room or a room nearby."" He describes hearing Kitagawa's slippers approaching his room, pulling off the futon he was sleeping under and lying down next to him.  ""He began massaging my feet,"" Okamoto said, and alleged that Kitagawa touched his genitals and performed oral sex on him. Okamoto said the following day Kitagawa gave him 10,000 yen (about US$75) without giving a reason.  By the time Okamoto left Johnny & Associates in 2016, he alleged that he had been assaulted between 15 and 20 times by Kitagawa.  He said he saw between 100 and 200 Juniors rotating in and out of the apartment during the four years he was with the agency, and alleged the majority of them were similarly assaulted by Kitagawa.  ""There were things I saw. In some instances it happened right next to me because we were sleeping in the same room. I would say three other members for sure, but to be honest I think that almost everyone fell victim to him because as long as we stayed at his place it would be very rare that someone would be unscathed,"" he said, adding that he believes ""the majority of the 100 to 200 during my time experienced that."" For a long time, Okamoto said he couldn't talk about his experiences.  ""There are others... who have decided to stay anonymous. I chose to show my face. But that might change as well. That is the hope that I have,"" he said.  Okamoto also alleged that if a boy refused Kitagawa's advances, their career would be over.  While Kitagawa ""would never directly or explicitly mention that if you don't do so and so, you won't be a success,"" Okamoto said, his favorites would be picked for their debuts as entertainers and receive more opportunities. ""It was a special situation in that someone who would be standing next to Johnny-san would be picked to, for example, act in a TV program or be allowed to form a boyband."" He said it was ""general awareness among everyone"" that ""you have to be at his place to succeed, so you have to even take the initiative to be at his place."" Okamoto said he was frustrated that long-standing allegations against Kitagawa had not been taken seriously. Okamoto said because of Kitagawa, ""my life did turn around"" but ""I also believe what Johnny-san did to me...and to the other Juniors was a bad thing.""

                      Screaming people and bodies everywhere: The horrific aftermath of Myanmar junta airstrike that killed 165

                      Relatives were still recovering the charred bodies and limbs of victims killed in a military airstrike on a village in central Myanmar Wednesday, a day after one of the deadliest attacks since the junta seized power in a coup two years ago. An eyewitness, who hid in a tunnel during the attack, described a scene of horror as he approached the site of the military airstrike -- of children dying, women screaming, and bodies heaped on the ground.  At least 165 people, including 27 women and 19 children, were killed after Myanmar's military junta bombed Kanbalu township in the central Sagaing region on Tuesday, the human rights minister of the ousted shadow National Unity Government Aung Myo Min wrote on Twitter, before confirming the figures to CNN.  A further 30 people were wounded, 20 of whom remain in a serious condition including a pregnant woman and an eight-year-old child. Of those who died, 158 bodies have been cremated, Aung Myo Min added in his comments to CNN.  First responders and medical teams haven't been able to return to the site of the attack because military planes have continued flying over the town, though there have been no further strikes, Aung Myo Min said earlier. About 300 people had gathered in Pazigyi Village early on Tuesday morning to celebrate the opening of a local administration office, an eyewitness told CNN on the condition of anonymity because he fears retribution. Families had traveled from nearby villages for the event, where tea and food was offered and which coincided with the start of the Thingyan New Year celebrations.  Like much of Sagaing, the area is not under the control of the military junta. The new town office was being opened under the authority of the shadow National Unity Government (NUG), for the people, as part of the anti-junta resistance. ""We didn't have any warning,"" the eyewitness said. ""Most of the villagers were inside the event, so they didn't notice the jet."" Just before 8 a.m., a junta aircraft bombed the village where the ceremony was being held, the eyewitness and local media reported. An Mi35 helicopter then circled and fired on the village minutes later, the eyewitness told CNN.  ""When I arrived at the scene we tried to search for people still alive,"" he said. ""Everything was terrible. People were dying (as they were being transported) on motorbikes. Children and women. Some lost their heads, limbs, hands. I saw flesh on the road."" The eyewitness said he saw dozens of bodies after the attack, including children as young as five. He said he lost four family members in the strike, and a young child from his village was among the dead.  ""I saw lots of people coming onto the scene to search for their kids, crying and screaming,"" he said.  At around 5:30 p.m. the junta jets returned and shot the same place they had bombed that morning, he said.  CNN cannot independently verify the incident but the eyewitness's account matches reports in local media and from the NUG.  Videos and images from the aftermath, shown to CNN from witnesses and a local activist group, also show bodies, some burned and in pieces, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris. Myanmar's junta spokesman Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun confirmed the airstrike on Pazigyi Village and said if civilian casualties occurred it was because they were forced to help ""terrorists.""  The junta has designated the NUG and resistance groups known as the People's Defense Force in the country as terrorists.  ""At 8 a.m.... NUG (National Unity Government) and PDF (People's Defense Force) conducted an opening ceremony of the public administration office at Pazigyi village,"" Zaw Min Tun said on the military's Myawaddy TV channel.  ""We had launched the attack on them. We were informed that PDF were killed at that event under the attack. They are opposing our government."" The strike was condemned internationally, with one top UN official saying global indifference to the situation in Myanmar contributed to the attack. ""The Myanmar military's attacks against innocent people, including today's airstrike in Sagaing, is enabled by world indifference and those supplying them with weapons,"" said Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar. ""How many Myanmar children need to die before world leaders take strong, coordinated action to stop this carnage?"" The US Department of State said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the airstrikes and called on the regime to ""cease the horrific violence."" ""These violent attacks further underscore the regime's disregard for human life and its responsibility for the dire political and humanitarian crisis in Burma following the February 2021 coup,"" it said, using an alternative name for Myanmar. It's been just over two years since the military seized power, ousting the democratically elected government and jailing its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In order to crush resistance, the junta regularly carries out airstrikes and ground attacks on what it calls ""terrorist"" targets. The attacks have killed civilians, including children, and targeted schools, clinics, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. Whole villages have been burned by junta soldiers and thousands of people have been displaced in the attacks, according to local monitoring groups.  Battles between the military and resistance groups unfold daily across Myanmar. These rebel groups, some of whom have aligned with some of the country's long-established ethnic militias, effectively control parts of the country out of the junta's reach. Resistance groups and humanitarian organizations have repeatedly accused Myanmar's military of carrying out mass killings, air strikes and war crimes against civilians in the regions where fighting has raged, charges the junta repeatedly denies -- despite a growing body of evidence. ""They're losing control of the country. They're losing ground. Things are much more unstable on the ground than they've ever been,"" the UN's Andrews told CNN on Wednesday. ""As a result of that, they're using air power more and more and, of course, as they do so, more and more civilians are being killed."" On Monday, junta airstrikes hit a town in western Chin state's Falam Township, killing nine people when bombs dropped on a school, according to local media Myanmar Now and The Irrawaddy.  Last week, 8,000 refugees in southern Karen state fled across the border to Thailand, escaping fighting in Myawaddy township, according to a statement from Thailand's Tak provincial office public relations department, posted to Facebook.  In March, at least 22 people, including three monks, were killed at a monastery in southern Shan state. And a military airstrike on a school in Sagaing in September killed at least 13 people, including seven children. The eyewitness to Tuesday's attack said the ""situation in Myanmar is worse now."" ""People are dying like dogs or cows. We don't have any weapons to compare with what the military has. We need the help of the international community,"" he said.

                      US wholesale inflation saw dramatic cooldown in March

                      US inflation at the wholesale level continued its downward slide in March with annualized price increases sinking dramatically to 2.7% from an upwardly revised 4.9%, according to the Producer Price Index released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  It's the lowest annual level for the key inflation gauge since January 2021. On a monthly basis, producer prices slumped by 0.5%, driven by falling goods prices, specifically lower energy prices. Prices for fresh and dry vegetables also fell, as did services, while the price indexes for categories such as light motor trucks, chicken eggs and meats moved higher. Economists were expecting annual inflation, as measured by the PPI, to land at 3% for the 12 months ended in March and for no change from the month before.  ""It's good news that it looks like inflation is coming off the boil here,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, told CNN. ""There is a pronounced slowing in producer goods, and if I had to bet, I would say that this is going to lead to lower prices for the goods sitting on the store shelves in the coming months."" Core PPI, which excludes the more volatile components of food and energy, declined 0.1% for the month and, for the 12 months ended in March was up 3.4%, down from the upwardly revised level of 4.8%. PPI is one of several closely watched inflation gauges. Because the producer-centric index captures price shifts upstream of the consumer, it's sometimes looked to as a potential leading indicator of how prices may eventually land at the store level. Since notching a 11.2% gain in June 2022, the PPI has seen a stark cooldown in the months since, as supply chains have got back into sync since being discombobulated by the pandemic and the sharp economic recovery that followed.  Consumer prices have come down as well, but at a more moderate pace.  The March Consumer Price Index, released Wednesday, was 5%, the lowest annualized rate since May of 2021, according to the BLS. Much like CPI, the annual PPI also appears to have benefited from base effects, when year-over-year comparisons are volatile. In March 2022, a time when Russia had just invaded Ukraine and food and energy prices skyocketed, the PPI shot up to a record 11.7%. Month-to-month comparisons can be volatile, but the the PPI's 0.5% drop seen in March did follow an unchanged reading in February.  Jobless claims on the rise Separately on Thursday, the Department of Labor released the latest snapshot of jobless claims.  Initial weekly claims for unemployment insurance climbed to 239,000 for the week ended April 8, the highest level since January 2022. Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received unemployment benefits for more than one week, dropped to 1.81 million for the week ended April 1, from 1.82 million the week before.  Weekly jobless claims, considered a proxy for layoffs, can be volatile and frequently subject to revision. Last week, the Labor Department made a series of significant adjustments to recent years' data to better account for pandemic-era dynamics. As of Thursday's report, the four-week average for weekly claims was 240,000, slightly higher than what was seen before the onset of the pandemic. ""The labor market is softening,"" Rupkey said. ""And it's not just softening, it's starting to look worrisome."" Unemployment is an indicator of recession, which Federal Reserve economists say became more likely following last month's banking crisis, according to the minutes from the central bank's March policy meeting released Wednesday.  Rupkey said the latest employment picture indicates a 50-50 chance of a downturn, but trends could become more clear in the coming weeks. ""When the labor market becomes unglued, it is like a runaway train: The layoffs start, and no one can stop it. It's too late, and the Fed's policy tightening has done too much,"" he said.  ""So right now, we're not quite there. ... If initial claims fall back under 200,000, where they were for a couple of weeks at the start of the year, then OK, the recession is off. But if it climbs further — 250,000, 260,000 — I would be worried,"" he said.

Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The ""best we can hope for,"" he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until ""deep into next year,"" he added. Analysts at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, for their part, see the S&P 500 finishing 2023 only about 2% below Wednesday's close. Morgan Stanley foresees a drop of nearly 5%. Another Silicon Valley Bank? Stocks aren't the only assets that notched excessive valuations when cheap money encouraged investors to take big risks. The prices of government bonds, real estate and even cryptocurrencies also shot up.  This widespread exuberance could lead to a particularly harsh reckoning, according to Grantham. The recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank, for example, was triggered in part by losses on its bond holdings as interest rates jumped and prices of US government debt fell. As the bubble deflates, it's all but certain to result in an economic downturn, he predicted. ""Every one of these great bursts of euphoria, the great bubbles with overpriced markets ... has been followed by a recession,"" Grantham said. ""The recessions are mild if everybody does everything right and there [are] no complications. They are terrible if people get everything wrong."" In the meantime, investors should ""count on being surprised,"" Grantham said. It would have been difficult to predict the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, or the need for the Swiss government to swoop in and orchestrate an emergency rescue of Credit Suisse, he explained. ""When the great bubbles break, they do impose a lot of stress on the system,"" Grantham said. ""It's like pressure behind a dam. It's very hard to know which part will go."" The correction in the bond market may be almost complete, Grantham forecast. But stock valuations remain ""way above any long-term traditional relationship"" to corporate performance.  Strain in the financial system could therefore grow when, as he expects, the US economy enters a recession and corporate earnings begin to take a hit. Economists at the Federal Reserve are predicting a mild recession in late 2023 because of fallout from the banking crisis. Even in this environment, though, there will be opportunities to make money. (GMO has a US equity fund, with holdings in companies such as Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil and Kroger.) But in the short term, ""almost everybody gets hurt"" as asset prices come back down to Earth, Grantham said. Ghosts of crises past Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What's even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said.  That's what happened in Japan in the early 1990s, unleashing a long period of economic stagnation that haunts the world's third-largest economy to this day. ""They have had basically a lost 20 years, and in addition a fairly lame 10 years,"" Grantham said. He added: ""The occasions where people have tried to break a bubble in the stock market and the real estate market together are fairly ominous."" Fears about the health of the US commercial real estate industry have grown in recent weeks. The sector, which relies heavily on debt financing, has been hit hard by rising interest rates. The popularity of remote work has been particularly difficult for offices, a market Grantham quipped was in ""ragged disarray.""  Meanwhile, US home prices, which hit record highs in 2022, have also started to drop as mortgage rates have leaped. What's the way out? Grantham blamed central bankers for the emergence of the latest market bubble in the United States. They pursued policies in recent decades that artificially drove up the value of financial assets, setting the stage for crashes, he said.  Every Federal Reserve chair since Alan Greenspan, who led the US central bank from 1987 to 2006, ""has followed the same policy that lower rates are good for you,"" he said. ""What has it delivered? It's delivered a series of great bubbles that then break and inflict a lot of pain."" Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, would be wise to follow the example of Greenspan's predecessor, Paul Volcker, according to Grantham.  Volcker raised interest rates to unprecedented levels to fight inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He succeeded in curbing price rises, though his policies also led to a series of recessions. ""If Powell could just channel a little bit of Volcker, that would be a distinct improvement,"" Grantham said, suggesting that the Fed needs to stay the course on its rate hikes instead of buckling prematurely. Consumer inflation in the United States eased to 5% in March, the lowest annual rate since May 2021. That has boosted speculation among investors that the Fed could soon stop raising borrowing costs. But longer-term trends could prop up inflation for years to come, Grantham said.  Climate change is resulting in extreme weather and more intense and frequent natural disasters. That will disrupt the supply of commodities and raise food prices. Aging populations also pose a risk as smaller workforces command higher wages. ""These are not mild influences,"" Grantham said. ""These are very clear and important.""

                      Delta Air Lines reports record bookings for summer travel

                      Delta Air Lines reported record advanced bookings for this coming summer, a further sign that the US airline industry is putting the pandemic-caused losses behind it. But rising labor costs did result in a net loss in the period, even if the company reported a profit when excluding special items, the measure most closely followed by investors. The Atlanta-based airline earned $163 million, excluding special items, in the first three months of the year, compared to a loss of $784 million on that basis a year earlier. Revenue of $11.8 billion was up 45% from a year earlier, and up 14% from the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. The strong demand for flying means higher fares for customers. The amount passengers paid to fly each mile on Delta was up 17% compared to both a year earlier and the same period in 2019. Total passenger revenue when adjusted for capacity, another key measure of fares, was up 27% compared to a year ago and 14% from the same period in 2019. And planes were fuller, with Delta selling 81% of available seats, up from 75% a year earlier. The second quarter revenue and earnings were slightly below Wall Street forecasts, which the company attributed to flights canceled due to bad weather. But shares of Delta were higher in pre-market trading due to its strong forecast going forward.  The company said the record second-quarter bookings will allow it to post earnings per share of between $2 and $2.25, well above the current forecast of $1.66. For the full year, the company expects earnings per share of between $5 and $6, which could put it well above the $5.40 forecast from analysts. The company did take a one-time charge of $864 million related to the four-year labor deal it reached with pilots that will increase their pay 34% over the life of the contract. It provides them with an immediate 18% raise and a signing bonus that cost the airline $735 million. The charge for that signing bonus and change in benefits resulted in a net loss in the quarter of $363 million.  The airline also gave 5% raises to many of its other employees as of April 1. The pilots are the only major employee group at Delta who are union members. Other major US airlines, which are far more heavily unionized, face upcoming negotiations with a majority of their employees, and could also see rising labor costs in upcoming financial results.

                      US inflation just reached an inflection point
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,"
                      Apr 13, 2023
                    ","
                      After more than a year of soaring prices monopolizing the attention of Wall Street, Main Street, economists, and journalists, the tide may be turning.  According to some experts, inflation rates have reached an inflection point and painful interest rate hikes could soon ease.  The US Consumer Price Index, a widely used measure of inflation, has shown a significant deceleration since it shot up by 9% in June 2022. As of now, CPI inflation stands at 5%, the lowest it has been since May 2021.  Some economists believe that this level — around 5% — is the point at which inflation is no longer considered an emergency issue. That means the Federal Reserve could feel less pressure to quickly stabilize prices through aggressive, economically painful interest rate hikes.  ""Once inflation gets down below 5%. It disappears from the headlines,"" Johns Hopkins economist and central bank scholar Laurence Ball told Before the Bell last month. ""People go back to worrying about budget deficits or climate change or other public issues there are."" The 5% idea dates back at least to the 1980s when former Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer identified the threshold number as the point where inflation dropped way down the rankings of the nation's problems.  While the Federal Reserve maintains a target inflation rate of 2%, said Ball, ""I can imagine that a few years from now, inflation could still be at 3 or 4% and it won't be a front burner issue.""  Barry Ritholtz of Ritholtz Wealth Management echoed that sentiment on Wednesday. ""A 5 handle is a huge development,"" he wrote.  Other economists have backed the idea: A recent study by the economics department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that there was no significant economic pullback with inflation targets around 5%.  ""Our findings suggest that it is not typically necessary to force down inflation to such low levels, especially given that contractionary monetary policies succeed in controlling inflation primarily through the channel of raising mass unemployment and weakening workers' bargaining power,"" they wrote.  ""The Fed ... will insist that their job is done when inflation hits 2%,"" Ball told Before the Bell on Wednesday. But if inflation floats above that target while remaining relatively low, ""that's a situation where a lot of people, including me, are doubtful that the Fed will really act on what it's saying,"" he added. It's not necessarily a bad number for the stock market, either. An analysis of stock performance by BlackRock dating back to 1920 found that as long as inflation doesn't cross 10%, equities continue to perform relatively well. Between 1966 and 1999, nominal annual returns averaged 12.3% against an average 5% annual inflation rate. Still, there's a 67% chance that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter percentage point at its next meeting in May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Brainard: US banking system is 'sound' and 'stable' The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were ""poorly managed"" and ""took unacceptable risks,"" White House economic adviser Lael Brainard told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview Wednesday at Semafor's World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs.  ""The banking system, it's very sound, it's stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,"" said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council. ""There were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,"" she said. ""Those actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,"" she continued. How to avoid another crisis? Banks could hold more cash Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board, a body of global regulators and government officials, wrote in a letter released Wednesday that — unlike other recent shocks to financial markets — crises at US regional banks and Credit Suisse in March originated from ""within the financial system."" Later on Wednesday, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said that regulators could now place stricter liquidity requirements on lenders. So what does that mean? My colleague Anna Cooban reports: Banks could be told to hold more assets that can be easily converted into cash to pay back creditors in times of crisis.

                      JPMorgan executives knew about sex abuse claims against then-client Jeffery Epstein, court filing alleges

                      A new court filing alleges JPMorgan Chase executives were aware of sex abuse and trafficking allegations against its then-client Jeffrey Epstein, several years before the financial institution cut ties. The latest complaint, part of a lawsuit against the bank filed by the attorney general for the US Virgin Islands (USVI), adds an additional count alleging that JPMorgan obstructed federal law enforcement and prosecuting agencies pursuing Epstein. ""JP Morgan's relationship with Epstein in allowing his sex-trafficking venture to access large sums of cash each year went far beyond a normal (and lawful) banking relationship,"" the filing says, adding that bank executives were also aware of potentially suspicious cash withdrawals. Epstein, 66, was a client of the financial institution until 2013. He was found dead in a New York prison in August 2019.  Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges accusing him of operating a sex trafficking ring from 2002 to 2005 at his Manhattan mansion and his Palm Beach estate, in which he paid girls as young as 14 for sex. The new complaint against JP Morgan, filed Wednesday, comes days after its CEO Jamie Dimon sat down with CNN's Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview. Dimon told Harlow that ""hindsight is a fabulous gift,"" when asked whether the bank should have acted sooner after Epstein entered a guilty plea to soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida in 2008. A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment to CNN about the newly filed complaint, which was part of the lawsuit filed in December.  Attorneys for JP Morgan have denied the allegations. They accused the USVI government of looking for ""deeper pockets,"" according to court filings. The amended complaint details internal email exchanges and documents, alleging several examples that refute Dimon's suggestion that the financial institution needed ""hindsight"" regarding Epstein.  According to the filing, JPMorgan executive Mary Erdoes ""admitted in her deposition that JPMorgan was aware by 2006 that Epstein was accused of paying cash to have underage girls and young women brought to his home."" ""Mary Erdoes testified that JP Morgan terminated Epstein as a customer in 2013 after she became aware that the withdrawals were 'actual cash,'"" the filing alleged. Erdoes' deposition was taken last month. In addition, the filing claims that the JPMorgan Rapid Response Team noted in 2006 that Epstein ""routinely"" made cash withdrawals in amounts from $40,000 to $80,000 several times per month, totaling over $750,000 per year. Officials concluded that year that ""his account 'should be classified as high risk' and require special approval."" Internal emails quoted in the filing show JP Morgan employees including senior executives discussed coverage of the Epstein allegations for years after 2006 until he was terminated as a client seven years later. High level bank officials also met about Epstein's account and the allegations against him as far back as 2008, according to the court filing. In 2010, the company's risk management division flagged Epstein's official status as a sex offender. That was two years after he pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution with a minor in 2008 and spent about 13 months in prison. ""See below new allegations of an investigation related to child trafficking -- are you still comfortable with this client who is now a registered sex offender,"" according to an email in the newly unredacted portions of the court filing.  Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime confidante of Epstein's who was also a JP Morgan client, was flagged in 2011 by the bank's anti-money laundering compliance director when she allegedly sought to open an account for a ""personal recruitment consulting business."" ""What does she mean by personal recruitment? Are you sure this will have nothing to do with Jeffrey? If you want to proceed, I suggest that we flag this as a High Risk Client,"" the director wrote in an internal email. Also that year, a senior compliance official reviewing JP Morgan's information on Epstein called him a ""sugar daddy,"" noting his sponsorship of private bank accounts and credit cards for two 18-year-olds ""that appear to be part of his inner entourage,"" the lawsuit says. Last month, a federal district judge presiding over the case in Manhattan ruled that the lawsuit against JPMorgan could move forward, partially denying the bank's motion to dismiss the suit.

(You can get ""CNN's 5 Things"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Food prices American consumers are finally seeing a dip in grocery prices for the first time since 2020, according to new data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The meats, poultry, fish and eggs index fell 1.4%, pulled down by another month of large decreases in egg prices. In previous months, the cost of eggs surged primarily due to avian flu, which constrained supply. Some egg producers were also taking advantage of the disruption by raising prices to boost profits. Among the other foods showing a decrease, fruits and vegetable prices fell 1.3%, and dairy products ticked down 0.1%. However, some other indexes like beverages, cereals and bakery products, went up. This comes as groceries still remain expensive on an annual basis as US consumers contend with high inflation. 2. Trump Former President Donald Trump is expected to be back in New York City today to sit for another deposition for the civil lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The suit was brought against him, his children and the Trump Organization, alleging they were involved in an expansive scheme lasting over a decade by providing false financial statements to lenders and others that the former president used to enrich himself. Trump previously sat for a deposition for the case in August 2022, when he refused to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. It remains unclear whether he will be more willing to cooperate this time around. Trump's trip to New York comes on the heels of his unprecedented indictment last month when he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to 34 charges of falsifying business records. 3. Leaked documents The person behind a massive leak of classified US documents worked on a military base and posted sensitive national security secrets in an online group of acquaintances, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. According to the reporting, which CNN is working to independently verify, the Post described the alleged leaker as a lonely young man and gun enthusiast. He shared the classified material in a chatroom of about two dozen people on Discord -- a social media platform popular with video gamers. Some Discord users thought the documents were fake because they didn't think anyone would be brazen enough to post them online, according to a CNN review of messages on the platform. Discord said it is cooperating with law enforcement on the investigation, but declined to comment further. 4. Abortion A court order late Wednesday said a medication abortion drug can remain available for now, days after a federal judge in Texas ordered its approval to be suspended. Last Friday, US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk issued a ruling that would have halted the FDA's 23-year-old approval of the drug, mifepristone. Under the appeals court's new order, the approval will stay in effect and the drug will remain on the market while an expedited appeal plays out, though some restrictions remain. It is unclear if the Justice Department or the drug's manufacturer will ask the Supreme Court to intervene at this point. This comes as the legal battle over medication abortion continues to intensify after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. 5. North Korea Millions of people in Japan this morning received a J-alert, or an evacuation order, urging them to seek shelter after North Korea launched a missile in their direction. The alert sparked fear on the Japanese northern island of Hokkaido after officials said the missile could land on or near the island. But soon after, fear turned into anger and confusion as the evacuation order was lifted amid reports that the alert had been sent in error, with officials saying there was no possibility of the missile hitting the area. Tokyo later confirmed the missile had fallen outside Japanese territory, in waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. Still, South Korea and its allies condemned the missile test, with the White House saying Pyongyang's repeated tests continue to risk ""destabilizing the security situation in the region.""

                      A sheriff and a local firearms dealer in Frederick County, Maryland, have been indicted on federal charges for their roles in a scheme to illegally acquire machine guns so they could be rented out for profit, federal prosecutors announced.  A federal grand jury indicted Frederick County Sheriff Charles Austin Jenkins, 66, and Robert Justin Krop, 36, on charges of conspiracy and false statements to acquire machine guns, the US Department of Justice said in a Wednesday news release.  Krop, who owns firearms-related businesses in the county, is also charged with illegal possession of seven machine guns, the agency said. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.  Krop and his businesses are licensed to possess and deal machine guns under special circumstances, which include using the guns as demonstration samples for potential law enforcement buyers, according to the indictment.  The indictment alleges that from August 2015 to May 2022 Jenkins and Krop conspired to unlawfully purchase machine guns by falsifying documents on the sheriff's office letterhead which requested machine guns for evaluation and demonstration for the office. Instead of using the guns for demonstrations, however, the pair intended for them to be rented to Krop's customers to benefit his business, according to the indictment.  Krop drafted the documents for Jenkins to sign, and then they submitted the false paperwork to licensed dealers, importers and manufacturers, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, saying the guns were for demonstration to law enforcement, the indictment alleges. ""The indictment further alleges that Krop's business offered political support to Jenkins in recognition of his support for the business,"" the DOJ said in its release. Jenkins, who has been sheriff since 2006, was reelected in 2022, it said. CNN has reached out to Krop for comment. As the court case plays out, Jenkins will take a leave of absence from his position as sheriff ""out of respect for the men and women of this agency and not to interfere with effective operations,"" he said in an April 12 statement announcing the leave.  ""I have full confidence in the system, and I know that my innocence will prevail at the end of all this and that I will be found not guilty,"" Jenkins said in the statement provided by the sheriff's office.  Jenkins remains in his position as sheriff, Todd Wivell, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office, said in a news conference Wednesday. Wivell read a statement on behalf of Jenkins that read in part, ""I have been in constant communication with the DOJ and the ATF for over a year and have been 100% cooperative throughout the course of this investigation."" Frederick County is about 50 miles west of Baltimore, Maryland.  If convicted, the two face a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison. Krop would also face a maximum of 10 years in prison for unlawfully possessing machine guns.

                      The raging fire shooting toxic smoke from an eastern Indiana recycling plant has forced thousands of people to evacuate and countless more to wonder what the impacts might be to their health and environment.  Plastics were among the items that started burning Tuesday at the Richmond plant. And the thick, black column of smoke that rose from the site is ""definitely toxic,"" Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said. ""There is a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they're on fire, and it's concerning,"" Jones said Tuesday evening. He said the fire will likely burn for days.  The US Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday night it was evaluating the area, including school grounds, for potential fire debris that may contain asbestos. Asbestos is a naturally occurring, but very toxic, substance that was once widely used for insulation. When inhaled or ingested, asbestos fibers can become trapped in the body, and may eventually cause genetic damage to the body's cells. Exposure may also cause mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer.  While the cause of the inferno is not yet known, city officials ""were aware that what was operating here was a fire hazard,"" Richmond Mayor Dave Snow said Wednesday. ""This was a fear for us.""  No major injuries were reported, but about 2,000 of the city's 35,000 residents near the Ohio border were ordered to evacuate.  The evacuation zone covered residents within a half-mile of the fire, but authorities could change it if wind direction shifts, Jones said.  Residents downwind of the evacuation zone -- to the east and northeast -- were encouraged to shelter in place and bring pets indoors.  'The biggest risk is the unknown chemicals' Air quality tests by the US Environmental Protection Agency had not found toxic chemicals such as styrene or benzene as of mid-Wednesday morning.  Tests will continue as the smoke dissipates, emergency response on-scene coordinator Jason Sewell said. The EPA collected measurements overnight Tuesday into Wednesday, monitoring particulate matter and looking for toxic chemicals. But ""the biggest risk is the unknown chemicals that are formed as the compounds burn,"" said Richard Peltier, associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. ""We know that it is very common that a large range of chemicals are formed whenever plastic materials are burned, including styrene, benzene, and a wide number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons -- all of these are strong carcinogens, and it's important for people to avoid exposures,"" Peltier said.  Potential short-term health risks could include symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, coughing, headache and fatigue, Peltier said. ""Asthma is regularly triggered by these types of complicated exposures so if you have asthma, it's really important to be extra careful,"" he said. Longer-term problems could include an increased risk of cancer if someone is exposed to a high concentration of toxins for a prolonged period of time.  So, ""just because you have a short-term exposure doesn't necessarily mean you will get cancer,"" Peltier said. ""Your risk increases with duration and concentration."" For the first responders in Richmond, ""it's important that they wear full-face respirators, and (possibly) with tanked air,"" Peltier said. ""Their exposures will be to a profound mixture of particles (which can be filtered) and gases (which cannot), and they need to take extraordinary measures to remain safe."" 'I didn't have shoes on' and fled The billowing black smoke stirred memories of the recent toxic train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio. After a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials derailed, a days-long inferno ensued. High levels of some chemicals from that disaster could pose long-term risks, researchers have said. Richmond resident Brenda Jerrell ""didn't hesitate"" to leave her home near the burning recycling plant. ""The smell had already been bad,"" she told CNN. ""I didn't have shoes on; I had socks on,"" she said. ""I left my purse, my shoes -- I left a lot of things, personal things ... and just got in the car and drove away.""  Covering her mouth and nose with a mask, Jerrell was ""still worried because they're telling us they don't know what was burning and that, you know, irritation may occur."" For now, the main health concern is smoke, Wayne County Health Department Executive Director Christine Stinson said Wednesday.  ""These are very fine particles -- and if they're breathed in can cause all kinds of respiratory problems: burning of the eyes, tightening of the chest, it could aggravate asthma, cause bronchitis and all kinds of things,"" she said.  The EPA will ""absolutely"" be involved in monitoring air quality in Richmond, its administrator told CNN on Wednesday. ""We're going to keep the emergency response group on the ground, up-to-speed on what those results are,"" Michael Regan said. ""We've been on site since the beginning, and we're going to stay there until we can assure that this community is not seeing any threats from the air quality implications here."" Toxic pollutants could pose risks, experts say N95 masks -- the kind widely used during the Covid-19 pandemic -- are most protective against particulate matter in the area, but if people are seeing or smelling smoke or experiencing symptoms, they should leave, Stinson said.  Planet-warming pollution also surely is being emitted from the fire, said former Regional EPA Administrator Judith Enck, now president of Beyond Plastics, which aims to end plastic pollution. ""But the bigger issue is that when plastics are burned, dioxin is often formed,"" she told CNN. The EPA says dioxins are highly toxic pollutants that can cause cancer, and reproductive and developmental problems. They also take a long time to break down.  Dioxin tests must be done by state officials, Enck said. ""Even small amounts can cause significant health damage."" Phthalates, bisphenols and microplastics are also released when plastics are burned, she added. ""Plastics burn hot and fast,"" Enck said. ""Lots of chemicals can be released, so (plastic) should not be stockpiled."" Stockpiling, however, is a common problem at plastics recycling facilities since there are so few reliable domestic markets, she said. The 175,000-square-foot facility burning in Richmond is ""completely full from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall,"" city Fire Chief Tim Brown said Tuesday.  Officials warn residents: Don't touch debris in your yard Melted plastics and roofing materials have been identified in pictures from residents. But those who find remnants from the fire in their yards are asked to ""not disturb or touch the debris"" because ""it is unknown what chemicals may or may not be in the debris,"" Wayne County Emergency Management Agency officials said. EPA officials plan to sample those materials and send them off for analysis, Sewell said. ""Based on the age of the building, it's possible there could be asbestos-containing materials in some degree that would have left the site,"" Sewell said Wednesday, referring to naturally occurring, toxic minerals that were long used in items such as home insulation and hair dryers. ""We would ask that people certainly do not mow the debris,"" Sewell said. ""If you're finding debris in your yard, leave it be until we know more information. Certainly, don't mow it up.""    'The largest fire I've seen in my career' Firefighters responded to the recycling facility Tuesday to find a semitrailer behind one of the plant's buildings engulfed in flames, Brown said.  The trailer was loaded with an ""unknown type of plastics,"" and the fire spread to other piles of plastics around the trailer and eventually to the building, Brown said. Firefighters had trouble getting access to the facility, with piles of plastic blocking access roads, Brown said. ""It creates quite a challenge because we only have access to one side of the building,"" he added. ""Once the fire got out of control, it darkened down on us, (and) we backed out real quick and then went into defensive mode,"" Brown said. The flames spread to several buildings at the site, but crews managed to stop the fire's spread before it could jump into residential areas, Brown said. ""It's probably the largest fire I've seen in my career,"" Brown said. One firefighter was released from a hospital after falling and hurting his ankle, Brown said, and no other injuries were reported. Everyone who was said to be working at the building when crews responded to the scene has been accounted for, he said.

                      A 2019 hearing detailed potential fire hazards at the now-burning Indiana recycling plant, and its owner admitted a building did not have fire sprinklers

                      More than three years before a large blaze at an eastern Indiana recycling plant began spewing toxic smoke and prompting evacuations, potential fire hazards at the facility had been detailed at a meeting with local leaders. A September 2019 hearing by the city of Richmond's Unsafe Building Commission outlined significant code violations at the recycling plant in Richmond, according to meeting minutes obtained by CNN. At the 2019 meeting, Seth Smith, the owner of the recycling plant, admitted conditions at the plant had gotten ""out of control,"" and that one of the buildings at the site had no fire extinguishing system, claiming that an auction company selling the land destroyed the fire system before he took control of it.  ""I took a review of what was there and what it would take to do it and basically, no fixing that (fire sprinkler) system,"" Smith said, according to the minutes.  Richmond's deputy fire chief, Doug Gardner, noted at the hearing there was an ""excessive amount of plastic materials stored in and around the building,"" and that ""many of the stacks are unstable and several have fallen over."" Aaron Jordan, the city's building commissioner, said that inside the recycling plant building, ""there are boxes stacked up all the way to the ceiling.""   He also noted that some of the materials were too close to the property line, which was a fire hazard.  ""If it would catch on fire it would catch the building next to it on fire,"" Jordan said, according to the minutes. ""It needs to be 10 feet away from the lot line."" Inspections at the site also found widespread roof leaks and structural issues with its buildings. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also conducted an ""air plume study"" of the properties at Gardner's request to determine the density of the particles in the air in the event that a fire was to occur. The study ""caused concerns for possible evacuations of the area,"" records show. CNN reached out to NOAA and the city of Richmond for a copy of that study but did not receive a response. This week's raging fire at the plant has forced evacuation orders for thousands of people since it started Tuesday, while many wonder what the impacts of the thick, toxic smoke may be on their health and community.  Among the burning items were plastics, which can give off a ""host of different chemicals"" when they're on fire, Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said. The smoke rising from the site, Jones said Tuesday, is ""definitely toxic."" A court in 2020 found the property to be unsafe In the 2019 meeting minutes, Smith, the plant owner, made comments committing to cleaning up the site.  After the building commission granted a one-month continuance to explore a plan of action, it reconvened in October 2019 and issued formal findings of fact that the properties were unsafe.  The commission found that the ""cumulative effect of the code violations present"" rendered ""the premises unsafe, substandard, or a danger to the health and safety on the public,"" records show. The panel also ordered Smith to either repair or demolish and vacate the properties in the next 60 days. The next week, Smith and his company petitioned a court to review the commission's orders deeming his properties unsafe. In March 2020, an Indiana circuit court judge ruled in favor of the city, affirming the commission's decisions requiring Smith to fix conditions at his sites. The court found the evidence ""clearly established"" that Smith's properties ""are unsafe to people and property; constitute a fire hazard; are a hazard to public health; constitute a nuisance; and are dangerous to people or property because of violations of statute and City Ordinance concerning building condition and maintenance."" CNN reached out to Smith for comment but did not receive a response. The attorney that previously represented Smith in the lawsuit declined to comment.  City seized land last year In 2022, the city seized two of the three land parcels the recycling plant sits on after Smith failed to pay property taxes. ""We have been through several steps since then to order this particular business owner to clean up this property, because we were aware that what was operating here was a fire hazard,"" Richmond Mayor Dave Snow said at a Wednesday morning news conference.  It's unclear at this time what steps the city took to remedy the site since the seizure, and whether it took any steps before 2022 to enforce its orders requiring Smith to repair or demolish and vacate the properties. ""As you might imagine, cleaning up these sites is a significant undertaking,"" city attorney AJ Sickmann told CNN. ""The city was devoting available resources to abate the problems, but unfortunately the fire began before complete remediation could occur."" Details about how this week's fire started weren't immediately available. The mayor said the fire department initially responded to reports of a structure fire. Firefighters arrived to see a semitrailer behind a building engulfed in flames, and it spread to other piles of plastics around the trailer and eventually to the building, according to Brown, the fire chief.  ""Our access was very hampered by the rubbish and the piles of plastic that were surrounding the complex,"" Snow, the mayor, said. ""Yesterday we only had one way in to the entire structure. Today we're going to use excavators to gain access and to get to the deeper seeds of the fire.""

                      The wildfire in New Jersey that has burned nearly 4,000 acres in is 75% contained are to reopen, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service tweeted Wednesday night. The blaze that began in Manchester Township on Tuesday evening has burned 3,859 acres, authorities said, and all of the previously announced road closures in the area were to be lifted at 9 p.m. The service said its personnel will continue to work in several locations and urged residents to ""stay vigilant while driving through smoke conditions,"" because firefighters may be working on the side of the road. The fire remains under investigation, the forest service added. The fire came as record heat sets in across the Northeast. This single fire has burned more than half the average acres burned in New Jersey in an entire year, according to statistics from the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. About 170 structures in the Manchester Township area were evacuated Tuesday night, but all residents have since been allowed to return home, Manchester Police Chief Robert Dolan said during a news conference Wednesday. No structures are damaged and no injuries have been reported, officials said, but firefighters have faced ""extreme fire behavior,"" said John Cecil, the assistant commissioner of state parks, forests and historic sites at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  ""We saw a wall of fire, 200-foot flames, raining fire embers. I don't mean to be dramatic, but this was a severe situation that these guys and gals managed to keep in place and protect lives and property. And for that, we cannot thank them enough,"" Cecil said. The fire was primarily burning on federal, state and private property in Manchester Township, but it had jumped to the adjacent borough of Lakehurst. Record heat will make fire conditions even worse Summerlike temperatures are expected to last through Friday, with more than 25 potential high records falling. ""We've been under high pressure the past couple of days. This is drying out the 'fuels' (dry brushland, dead leaves etc.). We should stay under high pressure for the next day,"" Cameron Wunderlin, National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly, New Jersey, told CNN. ""Relative humidity drops very low with this flow around the high and all the ingredients are there for the fire weather concerns."" The record heat will only make fire conditions worse during the week, as temperatures soar into the mid-80s across New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast along the I-95 corridor. Overnight temperatures will also remain high, which will create challenging conditions for firefighters. Nighttime temperatures will only drop to the low 60s or upper 50s, which won't allow for much recovery overnight.  ""Relative humidity is calculated by temperature and the amount of moisture,"" Wunderlin said. ""So if you have record highs and low humidity, the relative humidity will drop below the 30% threshold that we look for extreme fire behavior."" Places like New York City, New Brunswick, New Jersey, and even Philadelphia could break records Friday with temperatures expected to top out in the mid-80s.  Springfield, Massachusetts, could shatter its previous record of 77 by nearly 10 degrees if it hits the forecast high of 86 on Friday. Winds will remain a factor as sustained winds are expected to stay around 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph.  April is considered peak fire season for New Jersey. The state has seen other large fires in recent years, including one just last year that scored more than 13,000 acres. The fire in 2022 was roughly 50 miles from where the current fire is burning.

                      Whitney Austin, who survived a 2018 mass shooting of a bank in Cincinnati, Ohio, called for gun reform during her remarks at Wednesday's vigil in Louisville, Kentucky.  ""Monday morning was heartbreakingly familiar to me. I've done this before,"" said Austin, who was shot 12 times during the mass 2018 shooting. She encouraged the community to lift the victims and first responders in prayer and support them.  She also advocated for gun reform, ""It is only through action that change will ever come.""  The Louisville Metro Police Department has released all of the 911 calls it plans to distribute from the bank shooting, according to department spokesperson Aaron Ellis. Twelve 911 calls and two emergency responder radio transmissions were released Wednesday. ##911 Audio## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence A woman called 911 on Monday morning after seeing an officer go down after being shot at outside Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky.  “We saw one officer down,” the woman relays to the dispatcher. Another witness describes the scene to the dispatcher as they watched the incident from across the street. “I just wanted to make sure you understood that there was an officer down,” the male witness tells the dispatcher. “There are several officers here now, but the one hasn’t moved since he’s been shot. Two have been shot at.” “I’ve been watching him consistently, I haven’t seen a foot or anything moving,” he added, “He went down right away when the bullets started firing,” Officer Nickolas Wilt is in critical condition after he was shot in the head during a confrontation with the gunman. His colleague, Officer Cory “CJ” Galloway, suffered a minor bullet wound. ##911 Audio## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. Additional  911 calls released by the Louisville Metro Police Department detail concerns from employees in the bank building where the shooting took place on Monday.   “We are on the 4th floor, we are trying to get the status of what’s going on,” the caller says, “We’re tucked under a desk right now.” The 911 operator calmly tells the caller to remain in place as police officers clear the building: “As far as my understanding, the shooter has been taken into custody. As far as my understanding, the scene is safe at the moment.”  The shooter was killed in a gun battle with police at the scene.  The 911 operator tells the caller everyone should stay put while officers search the building to make sure there were no other threats. The caller agrees and says all the doors are locked.  “Officers may be coming toward that area and they will be announcing themselves as officers,” the operator says. ##911 Audio## Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan had a message for employees attending the community vigil in Louisville and watching virtually: “To all of you please know we will get through this together."" A mass shooter, who police said was an employee, opened fire at the bank on Monday morning, killing five people and injuring several others. Ryan said there are ""no words"" to describe what happened or how the victim's families are feeling. ""The greatest way we can continue to honor everyone that has been impacted by this tragedy is to do our best to follow their example,"" he said. ""We need to love one another, we need to care for one another and we need to support one another."" He said he is praying for both the employees and police officers that were hurt and are still recovering and thanked first responders, medical teams and the Louisville community for their support. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear responded Wednesday to the release of 911 audio from the deadly Louisville bank shooting.  ""This person murdered my friend. But still, I can't imagine how his parents must be feeling. Right now,"" Beshear said.  Beshear's friend Tommy Elliott, a bank executive, was killed by the gunman.  The governor said he wanted his friend to be remembered as a loving father and husband.  ""Man, he had a great smile. His eyes lit up. Loved life. Was always into something. Trying to make the city a better place, he was just always into something,"" he said, in his first interview since the tragic shooting, with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Elliott, the bank's senior vice president, had chaired Beshear's 2019 inaugural committee and was a well-known figure in Kentucky Democratic politics. ""He was trying to plan for me for when I'm done being governor, which was something that I hoped we could eventually plan for together,"" Beshear said. ""An amazing human being, a loving dad."" One of the 911 calls released Wednesday included one from the mother of the gunman.  Relaying details from her son's roommate, she said her son ""apparently left a note"" as she expressed her shock and confusion. ""My son might be (redacted) has a gun and heading to the Old National on Main Street here in Louisville,"" she said in the call. ""This is his mother. I'm so sorry, I'm getting details secondhand. I'm learning about it now. Oh, my Lord."" Hear Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear here: ##911 Audio## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said there will be a time for action and change, but now is a time to mourn those killed in a mass shooting at a bank Monday. At a community vigil Wednesday evening, the mayor said whether people knew any of the victims personally or not, it is important to “acknowledge that every violent death is tragic."" He said it's also important to support those who survived the shooting through their physical and mental healing. “We are all in pain right now,"" he said. “Everyone I’ve spoken to since Monday is sharing some version of the same experience – and too many people have had this experience before this week,"" Greenberg added, referring to the dozens of people he said have been killed by gun violence in the city so far this year. He said the vigil and other kinds of reflection are important so that grief can be turned into action. ""That day is coming. Today is to mourn,"" Greenberg said. The mayor also thanked the people who have brought ""light and love"" during a tragic week, including first responders and police officers. A second batch of 911 calls from the Old National Bank mass shooting has been released by the Louisville Metro Police Department Tuesday evening. The additional audio includes six clips of calls to 911 from the shooting and one clip of LMPD radio traffic. CNN is looking through the calls. ##911 Audio## The FBI is asking for people in Louisville, Kentucky, to share what they know about the mass shooting that killed at least five people at a bank earlier this week. FBI Louisville said there are two ways for people to submit tips, images for videos: Submit information at fbi.gov/bankshooting
            Call 502-574-LMPD It’s still not clear what provoked the 25-year-old bank employee to open fire. Workers inside Old National Bank during Monday's mass shooting were desperate for help as police responded to the scene, 911 calls from the incident revealed.  “We have an active shooter in our building,” a male caller inside the building said, identifying the shooter as “an employee of Old National Bank.”
            “Get here now! We need somebody now!” the caller said. Another man who spoke to 911 after fleeing the bank building and entering a dental office nearby said he ""did not see"" the shooter.  ""I just saw a shotgun as he was coming around the corner,” he said. “People have been shot.” The caller said he believed there were more than a dozen people in the room as shots were fired. “Please get people there fast, please… and ambulances, please” he said. “We’re going to get them out there,” the operator responded. “Keep yourself safe, OK? Stay in a safe location.” ##911 Audio## Radio transmissions made in the wake of the shooting released by Louisville police Wednesday show how EMS responded and organized to get medical attention to those inside the building. Emergency responders on the radio calls discussed and coordinated where the victims were located inside the building, their conditions, and who was responding. Here's what they said:  “The shooter has been eliminated…and they’re doing a search of the building at this time,” one responder radios.  Another says that there is “possibly a female hiding in the bathroom” who is on the phone with emergency services.  “We have one victim that’s been brought out to the corner of Preston and Main,” another responder radios.  Several emergency responders radio back and forth about the status of a police officer who was wounded before learning that the officer was already being transported to a hospital. “Where’s the officer?” someone asks.  “That’s what I’m trying to figure out,” another person replies, adding later that “the officer is actually being transported in the police car right now.” Other emergency staff give updates over the radio on victims they located inside.  “We have a patient also in the building…the center of the building, first floor bathroom. Female shot in the leg,” someone radios before new reports of more victims found come over the radio.  “Just to add to your count, we have another victim. It looks like a gunshot wound to the (redacted),” another emergency responder reports.  During the radio calls, emergency staff is told that a command center is being set up at the Slugger baseball stadium and everyone is told to bring any witnesses to the stadium. In one call over the radio, an emergency responder says they’re being diverted from the location to handle another shooting in the city.  “We’re responding to another shooting…at the Goodwill,” the person radios. Radio transmissions also describe officers arriving at the shooter’s house, encountering individuals there and ultimately securing the home.  “Cleared the house from what I understand,” a person radios.  ##911 Audio## Officials in Louisville, Kentucky, are preparing to host a vigil tonight to grieve the five people killed this week in a downtown bank shooting.  The city will hold a vigil at 5 p.m. ET Wednesday at the Muhammad Ali Center, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. The vigil will “acknowledge the wounds, physical and emotional, that gun violence leaves behind,” Greenberg told reporters Tuesday. “It will be an interfaith opportunity for our entire community to come together – to grieve, to heal, to begin to move forward.” A woman who called 911 said she saw a man with some type of assault rifle and bulletproof vest “jogging around” near the time of the shooting in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday. When the dispatcher asked if the person was shooting, she said, “No, ma’am he was kind of like jogging around like he was trying to get somewhere in a hurry.”   Though that's how the woman described the shooter, the gunman was not wearing a bulletproof vest, according to surveillance video during the shooting. The 911 call is among a set of calls that were released by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) on Wednesday related to the mass shooting that left five people dead. Yesterday, LMPD released dramatic bodycam video of officers responding to the attack.  This post has been updated throughout. ##911 Audio## A woman called 911 from inside Old National Bank in Louisville as she was hiding in a closet in the building during Monday’s shooting. The woman, who worked at the bank, told the dispatcher she believed eight or nine people were shot.  “I know who it is. He’s probably 6 feet tall; he’s a young male,” the woman told the dispatcher.  When the dispatcher asked the woman how she knew the gunman, she responded, “he works with us.” During the call with the woman, multiple shots can be heard as she sheltered in the closet. First responders can be heard making contact with the woman after the shooting ceased. ##911 Audio## A worker of Old National Bank witnessed the shooting while participating in a video meeting on Monday morning and called 911 after seeing the gunman walk into the meeting room. “There’s an active shooter there,” the caller said in a 911 call that was released on Wednesday. The woman said she works at a different branch of the bank. The woman was in distress, yelling and crying as she described to the dispatcher what she saw. “I see somebody on the floor and we heard multiple shots and everyone started saying ‘Oh my god’ and then he came into the board meeting,” she added.  ##911 Audio##  The Louisville Metropolitan Police Department (LMPD) clarified Wednesday that there ""was no discussion about [the shooter] being terminated, and of course he wasn't fired,"" from his bank job prior to Monday's fatal workplace shooting. “He was an active employee there at Old National Bank, but there was no discussion about this individual being terminated,” LMPD Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel told CNN.  The mother of the shooter who killed five people at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday called 911 after hearing secondhand that her son had a gun and was heading toward the bank. The mother made the call at 8:41 a.m. local time, three minutes after the first 911 call came in about the shooting. The mom said she was receiving details secondhand from the shooter’s roommate, who called her.  ""I don’t know anything,"" she said in clear distress. ""But we don’t even own guns; I don’t know where he would have gotten a gun.""  ""I know he doesn’t own any guns,"" she told the operator.  She told the operator multiple times that her son is not violent. “He’s never hurt anyone; he’s a really good kid. Please don’t punish him,” she said to the operator.  “He’s nonviolent; he’s never done anything,” she said later in the call. The mother asked the operator what she should do and if she should go to the bank. The operator told the mother that she has already received multiple calls to Old National Bank. ""You’ve had calls from other people? So he’s already there?"" she asked. 
            “Yes,” the operator said. 
            “I am advising you not to go to the location because it is [an] unsafe location and officers are already at the location, ma’am,” the operator said.  The mother thanked the phone operator and said goodbye. Police said in a news briefing Tuesday that the shooter used an AR-15-style rifle – the choice weapon of many US mass shooters – that he’d legally bought six days before the attack. ##911 Audio## The 911 calls from the Old National Bank mass shooting have been released by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD).  LMPD has released six clips of calls to 911 from the shooting and one clip of LMPD radio traffic. The clips range from 50 seconds to roughly 32 minutes long.  CNN is looking through the calls and will provide the latest updates.  ##911 Audio## Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead. During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was ""neutralized"" approximately three minutes after police responded. ""It's about a nine-minute span from the time he begins his assault,"" Cromwell said. ""And then there's a few minutes after that, before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that, when we respond to the scene. And then about three minutes after, we respond, the subject is neutralized."" Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.  Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a ""targeted"" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police. How it unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman was killed in a shootout with officers, police said. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report. ##Catch Up##  Officials are expected to release audio of 911 calls Wednesday about the shooting, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. It was among more than 145 shootings reported in the US this year with at least four victims, excluding a gunman. Police have already released dramatic police body camera footage of Monday’s shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say the bank employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The attacker, livestreaming the gruesome assault, fatally shot five of his coworkers in Kentucky’s most populous city around 8:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before the bank was to open, authorities said. Several others were hospitalized, including a rookie police officer who was shot in the head and was in critical condition Tuesday. “Our city is heartbroken,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday evening. “These five victims should not be dead – just like everyone else who was killed by gun violence in our city, in our country, should not be dead.” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that at least 40 people have been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. ""This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. You may think this will never happen to you, never happen to any of your friends or loved ones. I used to think that. The sad truth is that now no one in our city, no one in our state, no one in our country has that luxury anymore,"" he continued. Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence. ""Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how we reduce gun violence in our city,"" he said. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for congressional Republicans to pass gun reform policies, saying that the issue is not political. ""We need policies in place that will keep this from happening again so that thoughts and prayers do not have to be offered to get another community ripped apart by the savage violence coming from guns,"" McGarvey said in a Tuesday briefing. ""I had somebody tell me the other day, 'don't make this political.' Fine. Don't make this political. People's lives aren't political. Public safety isn't political. Put those policies in place that put people first. People over guns, kids over guns, public safety over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem,"" McGarvey added. McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove firearms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in a bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks. A 26-year-old rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago – was hospitalized after being shot in the head while responding to a mass shooting Monday at a downtown bank that left five people dead and others injured, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Officer Nickolas Wilt underwent brain surgery after being struck during a shootout in the bank that left the gunman dead, Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department, said Monday afternoon during a news conference. The officer was still in critical condition Tuesday afternoon. “They have him sedated. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It’s just a wait and see,” LaGrange Fire Chief Jim Sitzler told CNN. Wilt is a volunteer firefighter with the department, Sitzler said. Wilt was new to the police department, having graduated from the police academy on March 31, according to the fire chief.

The city is set to honor the victims in a vigil Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET.  Here’s what we know so far about the lives lost: Joshua Barrick, 40, and his family were members of the Holy Trinity Parish Louisville, the church wrote on Facebook. ""Our hearts are heavy, they are broken, and we are searching for answers,"" they wrote. ""Please keep the entire Barrick family in your prayers, including his wife, Jessica, and their two sweet children, who are students in our school."" Deana Eckert, 57, was one of the hospitalized victims who later died Monday, police announced. It’s unclear if she was among the three people in critical condition earlier in the day. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg described Eckert as a ""very kind and a very thoughtful person."" Tommy Elliott, Old National Bank senior vice president, is remembered by local and state leaders as a close mentor and beloved community leader. ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" state Sen. David Yates told CNN. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up."" Elliott, 63, was also close friends with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott’s wife. ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and also called the others who were killed ""amazing people"" who will be missed and mourned by their communities. Juliana Farmer, 45, was also an employee of the bank who had just started a new chapter in her life by moving to Louisville from Henderson, her aunt Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WFIE. It had only been her third week on the job, according to Brooks-Scott. She last talked to her niece on Easter. ""She loved life,"" Brooks-Scott said. ""She was a beautiful young lady. All I can say is that heaven has gained a beautiful angel."" Farmer leaves behind three children, four grandchildren, and a fifth due in September, according to her aunt. James ""Jim"" Tutt, 64, was a ""huge fan and supporter"" of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN. Tutt worked as the CRE market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, according to his LinkedIn. He was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization, since 2018 and recently served as its treasurer. CNN’s Caroll Alvarado, Celina Tebor, Elizabeth Wolfe, Laura Ly, John Miller and Holly Yan contributed to this report. A 25-year-old man in Kentucky legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership. Six days later he used that weapon to kill five of his colleagues at a downtown bank, Louisville Metro Police said Tuesday. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. Gun enthusiasts have described it as “one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi.” By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state’s laws as “among the worst in the country.” Kentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. “Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there’s no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they’re ever used in a crime,” CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said. “Red flag” laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out. If the Louisville mass shooter’s behavior “had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,” she said. Prior to 2019 – when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit – individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. “They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,” Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there’s no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over.

The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage Tuesday showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory ""CJ"" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.
            Officer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since Wilt was new to the force, he was acting based on ""his training and his character"" and that he ""never hesitates."" Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said.
            What happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them ""trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,"" Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.
            Bystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. Viewers can see an officer outside the bank.
            Before police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. ##Catch Up##  The family of the gunman who killed five people Monday in a bank shooting in Louisville, Kentucky, told CNN affiliate WDRB that they knew the 25-year-old struggled with depression, but saw no signs he was planning or capable of such violence. In a statement obtained by WDRB on Tuesday night, the family said that ""while Connor, like many of his contemporaries, had mental health challenges which we, as a family, were actively addressing, there were never any warning signs or indications he was capable of this shocking act.""  ""While we have many unanswered questions, we will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement officials and do all we can to aid everyone in understanding why and how this happened,"" according to the statement.  The family also praised police and expressed sadness for the victims of their son's actions.  ""No words can express our sorrow, anguish, and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people, their families, and the entire Louisville community,"" according to his family. ""We mourn their loss and that of our son, Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized by his senseless acts of violence and are deeply grateful for the bravery and heroism of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department."" This is what it means to serve and protect in a nation awash in guns. Harrowing, yet humbling, body camera footage of two Louisville officers who rushed into gunfire in Kentucky on Monday shows the demands placed upon police who respond to America's proliferating mass shootings and the terrible price they may pay. Video of what is effectively a street battle more akin to a foreign war zone than a US city basking in the morning sunshine offers a visceral antidote to the collective national shoulder shrug that often follows gun massacres. This is a raw, frightening scene, laced with courage and heroism. It offers a reality check about what unfolds in moments of terror and leaves the regular post-massacre political rituals of ""thoughts and prayers"" and doomed calls for gun reform looking empty by comparison. Some might question the need for Americans to see this disturbing footage. But it offers context to the bitter and often futile public debate about how to stop mass shootings and helps the public understand the horror they involve.  Here's what the footage shows: The breathtaking video shows rookie Officer Nickolas Wilt driving up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. After they take fire coming from inside the bank, Wilt slams the car into reverse before getting out with his handgun. Galloway races to the trunk to retrieve his service rifle. Then, without hesitating, they both advance up a set of steps — despite having no idea where the shooter, who turned out to be lying in wait, actually was. Suddenly, Galloway is down on the ground, with a minor gunshot wound after a deafening burst of fire. Wilt, who is blurred in the footage, lies shot in the head — another victim of the weapons of war that are often the preferred choice of mass killers. He is a good guy with a gun who was outgunned by a bad guy with a more powerful weapon. Galloway scrambles for some cover, and then is heard talking to other officers as they try to get a fix on the shooter's position — behind the glare of glass that means he can see them but they can't see him. Galloway, focused and in command, strategizes on how to challenge the shooter again and how to aid the fallen Wilt. Acting quickly is critical. And in a volley of shots, the shooter makes a fatal error, breaking a window in the bank, where four victims already lay dead and one mortally wounded. This gives Galloway a sightline. He shoots and yells, ""I think he's down ... get the officer!"" referring to Wilt, his trainee, who was shot on only his fourth time out on patrol. He's in the hospital in critical condition. ""What you saw in that video was absolutely amazing. It's tragic but it's absolutely amazing,"" Deputy Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey said, when he released the video. ""There's only a few people in this country that can do what they did. Not everybody can do that."" Read the full analysis here.

                      A man on death row in Florida for the 1989 killing of a couple was executed Wednesday evening, the Florida Department of Corrections said in a news release.  Louis Gaskin was sentenced to death in 1990 for the fatal shooting of Robert Sturmfels, 56, and Georgette Sturmfels, 55, on December 20,1989, according to court documents. Gov. Ron DeSanits signed Gaskin's death warrant March 13, according to the documents, and the state Supreme Court rejected appeals filed by Gaskin since the warrant was signed. The latest denial for a stay of execution was issued by a judge on Tuesday, court documents show.  Jurors recommended the death sentence in a 8-4 vote, which was accepted by the judge, according to court records. Gaskin was also convicted of armed robbery, burglary and an attempted murder committed the same night, according to court documents. Gaskin's execution comes six weeks after Donald Dillbeck, 59, was put to death for the 1990 murder of Faye Vann, 44, in Tallahassee, and three weeks before the scheduled execution of Darryl B. Barwick for slaying Rebecca Wendt, 24, in 1986 in Panama City, according to CNN affiliate WTXL.   Dillbeck, who died via a lethal injection in February, was the 100th person to be executed by the state of Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to the department.   Before Gaskin's execution, there were 298 people on death row in the state, according to the corrections department website. CNN has reached out to Gaskin's attorney for comment.

                      US prosecutors tell family of Shanquella Robinson they won't pursue charges in her death in Mexico

                      Federal prosecutors told the family of Shanquella Robinson on Wednesday that the evidence they have isn't enough for prosecution in Robinson's death last year in Mexico, the US Attorneys' Offices for the Middle and Western Districts of North Carolina said.  Robinson, a 25-year-old former student at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina, died in October while staying in a luxury rental property in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur.  ""Based on the results of the autopsy and after a careful deliberation and review of the investigative materials by both U.S. Attorneys' Offices, federal prosecutors informed Ms. Robinson's family today that the available evidence does not support a federal prosecution,"" the US Attorneys' Offices said in a release Wednesday. Family members are ""very deeply disappointed"" in the decision, but are ""not deterred"" and plan to continue to seek justice for Robinson, their attorney, Sue-Ann Robinson, said at a news conference.  ""Black and brown people always have to carve their own path to justice,"" attorney Robinson said. Shanquella Robinson was a Black American from North Carolina.  A copy of Shanquella Robinson's death certificate, obtained by CNN affiliate WBTV, listed the cause of death as ""severe spinal cord injury and atlas luxation,"" which is instability or excessive movement in the uppermost neck vertebrae. The document stated she was found unconscious in the living room of the rental residence on October 29. The death certificate classified Shanquella Robinson's death as ""accidental or violent,"" noting that the approximate time between injury and death was 15 minutes. Video posted online appeared to show a physical altercation inside a room between Shanquella Robinson and another person. It's not clear when the video was taken or if the video depicted the moment she suffered the fatal injury. At the time, Bernard Robinson confirmed to CNN it is his daughter seen in the video being thrown to the floor and beaten on the head. It's unclear what led to the altercation or how many people were in the room at the time. It's also unclear if anyone tried to intervene. The FBI conducted ""a detailed and thorough investigation of the evidence"" and worked with the Robinson family to conduct an autopsy in the United States by the Medical Examiner's Office in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, the release said.  Federal officials met with the Robinson family and representatives on Wednesday ""to offer their condolences and present the findings of the federal investigation,"" the release said. According to attorney Robinson, the family was told that the FBI interviewed Shanquella Robinson's travel mates and ""people who were in the house,"" but did not specify how many people they interviewed. The US officials told the family that the autopsy, which was completed after Shanquella Robinson's body had been embalmed and transported back to the US, revealed no spinal cord injury but did show swelling on her brain, although the cause of death is still said to be undetermined, the attorney said.  The attorney criticized what she considered a delay on the part of US investigating agencies, saying they waited to investigate until after their own autopsy was conducted.  ""There was no swift action on this case. There was absolutely no urgency on the part of the US authorities,"" Sue-Ann Robinson added. ""If you wait 'till five months after someone committed a crime... they would have the opportunity and time and space to delete text messages if that's what they wanted to do, to talk to each other about the case,"" the attorney said. Federal officials said they do not normally issue public statements about the status of an investigation, but in this case, they felt it was necessary because of the public concern surrounding the case.  ""It is important to reassure the public that experienced federal agents and seasoned prosecutors extensively reviewed the available evidence and have concluded that federal charges cannot be pursued,"" the statement said. Prosecutors in Mexico said last year they were investigating Robinson's death as femicide, a crime defined as the ""intentional murder of women because they are women.""  In most countries, including the United States, femicide is not different from homicide in criminal law, but Mexico is among at least 16 countries that have included femicide as a specific crime. The family plans to hold a march to the State Department headquarters Washington, DC, on May 19, the 200th day since Shanquella Robinson's passing, according to the family's attorney. ""The message cannot be that US citizens can go overseas and commit crimes against other US citizens and come back and say that they're on base, that they're safe, that they're not gonna be arrested, that there's gonna to be such a delay in the investigation that the evidence will have time to dissipate,"" she said.

                      Analysis: 'Tone deaf' Macron faces backlash over Taiwan comments

                      French President Emmanuel Macron might have hoped to focus this week on what may prove the biggest domestic test of his leadership, as France's Constitutional Council prepares to rule Friday on whether or not he can push ahead with controversial pension reforms.  Instead, he finds himself grappling with international blowback from last week's friendly visit to China -- and in particular from comments that have made him rather unpopular both in Washington DC and with some of his allies in Europe. On his flight home from Beijing, Macron gave an interview to POLITICO Europe. In it, he said that Europe must not become ""just America's followers"" when asked about the prospect of China invading Taiwan. ""The question Europeans need to answer ... is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No. The worse thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the US agenda and a Chinese overreaction,"" Macron said, adding that Europe must not get ""caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy."" Strategic autonomy is a Brussels term that refers to the EU having an independent geopolitical policy, which relies in part on the bloc being able to become a third power and not get squashed between the US and China. However, the China hawks, typically in Eastern Europe, have always been skeptical of anything that puts clear water between Europe and the US, who they see as the ultimate protectors of European territory through NATO. Macron has since attempted to downplay his comments, saying on Wednesday that France was ""for the status quo in Taiwan"" and that position ""has not changed."" But the hawks have already hit back. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said: ""Instead of building strategic autonomy from the United States, I propose a strategic partnership with the United States."" Lithuania's foreign minister tweeted ""We are capable of defending Europe without Chinese help. Instead of requesting assistance we should be projecting our strengths."" Eastern European diplomats have been less subtle. One said that Macron is ""simply tone deaf to everything happening in the world. No wonder Macroning has become a synonym of bullshitting without any result."" Another said they ""cannot understand"" Macron, that his visit to Beijing and remarks on Taiwan were ""not helpful"" and that Europe should engage with countries that ""value democracy and the rule of law"" over China.  Macron's trip was further undermined when Beijing performed military rehearses encircling Taiwan the day after he left China.  Risks to US ties European diplomats and officials say that while Macron doesn't speak for Europe and that the 27 EU member states have all agreed on an approach to China, they are aware that his comments -- and, they believe, attempts to present himself as the EU's leader -- could cause Europe real problems with the US,  particularly in terms of European security.  And they'd be correct. Multiple US government sources told CNN that while they are aware that Macron indeed doesn't speak for all of Europe, they are concerned that his words make it much harder to make the case for a strong transatlantic alliance to lawmakers in DC.  Case in point: Florida Senator Marco Rubio posted on Twitter shortly after Macron's comments were published, suggesting that if Macron ""speaks for Europe"" then maybe the US should focus on its objectives and let ""you guys handle Ukraine and Europe."" The US government sources said Macron's comments would only add to the skepticism some Republican lawmakers have about open-ended financial support to Ukraine, and fear the remarks could even contribute to a decision to block or curtail such funding. Worse, the sources also fear it could disrupt NATO unity -- which has been remarkably strong  since the start of the Ukraine crisis -- if countries start unilaterally undermining the priorities of others. A European government official who was at NATO headquarters for a meeting last week said there was broad agreement among the allies, including France, that Taiwan and security in the Indo-Pacific region was of crucial importance to the alliance. They were surprised to see Macron's comments so soon after that meeting.  For all that Macron's comments could be put down to a president under pressure at home doing things on the world stage to create a distraction, his comments on Taiwan have done real damage to the fragile transatlantic relationship.  It might not have been his intention, but Macron's comments have come at a yet unknown cost. And meanwhile, at home, he still faces a serious political crisis. His proposal to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, which was pushed through parliament without a vote, caused violent protests and nationwide strikes.  The reforms include other cost-cutting measures and are, Macron's government says, essential in preventing the pension system from collapsing. Social reforms like this were central to his 2022 re-election campaign. If they are blocked by the Constitutional Council, it will be a huge embarrassment for Macron.  ""Even if he gets his way, even if he sacks his prime minister, Macron has taken a huge political hit and it's hard to see how there won't be even more protests,"" says Aurelien Mondon, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Bath. ""He has always wanted to lead as the all-powerful, sole leader of France. Whatever goes wrong, it's on him.""

                      If this were the plot of a movie, it would be too far-fetched to be believable. South African authorities have taken over management of a maximum-security prison run by a private British security firm after a high-profile convicted murderer was accused of faking his own death in a fire, then escaping the prison to live in the open with his celebrity doctor girlfriend.   Thabo Bester was deported to South Africa by Tanzanian authorities on Thursday after being arrested in the border town of Arusha, having apparently fled the country, according to a media briefing by the South African Justice Minister and Minister of Police. This comes as media reports raised questions about the prison fire where he was said to have died.   It's a bizarre story that has embarrassed South Africa, exposed alleged loopholes in the management of a private prison and captivated the nation with every blockbuster revelation.   The 35-year-old convicted murderer was arrested with his girlfriend Dr. Nandipha Magudumana and a Mozambican national named as Zakaria Alberto on Friday. South African police minister Bheki Cele told reporters that the trio had several passports each that had not been stamped and were just 10 kilometers from crossing into Kenya.   Bester was sent to the Kgosi Mampuru Central Maximum prison in Pretoria where he will be closely watched. ""We are placing a 24-7 surveillance on him. We're also placing a 24-7 contact with him with selected highly trained Correctional Services officials to ensure that whatever circumstances he finds himself in, we'll be on call, and we do not experience any security breach,"" South Africa's Department of Correctional Services (DCS) boss Makgothi Thobakgale told reporters in Cape Town. Magudumana was also deported to Tanzania and named as an accomplice. She was arrested pending a court appearance on Thursday, according to the Police, and will be charged with murder, fraud as well as aiding and abetting his escape. Magudumana's 65-year-old father Zolile Cornelius Sekeleni and a former prison warden, Senohe Ishmael Matsoara, 38, were also arrested and accused of being accomplices in Bester's escape. The two men were charged with ""defeating the ends of justice, fraud, murder, and arson,"" in a Bloemfontein court on Tuesday. They did not enter a plea and have no lawyers on record. A judge ordered them to remain in custody until their next court date on April 17.  'A well-calculated and organized escape debacle' Bester was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for the rape and murder of model Nomfundo Tyhulu. A court had previously found him guilty of the rape and robbery of two other women he lured to his home on social media, with local media dubbing him ""the Facebook rapist."" He was initially reported to have died in a fire at the prison last May. But in November, the official position by South African prison authorities that Bester had been found dead in his cell began to unravel after local investigative outlet GroundUp's reporting raised doubts. Authorities later concluded that the burned body found in his cell was not Bester, and the person had died before the fire began.  ""A case of murder is under investigation following the outcome of the DNA analysis that confirmed that the body of the deceased which was found [in the cell], was not of Thabo Bester,"" police and the Justice & Correctional Services ministry said in a joint statement on Saturday.  ""The autopsy report went on to further reveal that the deceased had died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, and was already dead, prior to the arson incident,"" it added. The DCS last month said Bester appeared to have walked out of the facility in ""a well calculated and organised escape debacle."" It temporarily took over the management of the prison from the British company G4S, and suspended three of its own officials.  ""Greatly worrying is the fact that a private vehicle was allowed inside the facility without a gate pass on the day of the escape, possibly carrying an unknown body that was burnt beyond recognition in cell 35. This talks to a facility that has compromised its security system beyond any reasonable doubt,"" the DCS said in a statement last month. Three G4S officials were pressed by lawmakers on Wednesday to explain how Bester escaped from a maximum security prison they had described as ""one of the most secure in South Africa."" Though they deny any wrongdoing, they say three employees who were on duty have been dismissed and seven more remain suspended. A 22-page report presented alongside the G4S officials' appearance before the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services said an unauthorized phone and laptop were recovered in Bester's cell after the fire. Bester's application to be moved to solitary confinement because ""his life was in danger"" had been approved just three days before he escaped, they said. But many lawmakers were not satisfied, accusing the firm of dishonesty and failing to take responsibility for the prison break. ""You are a private company in a private public partnership with the state that is dishonest that came and deliberately misled the people's parliament. What would be your reaction to that?"" asked ruling party MP Xola Ngola. ""I would disagree with that,"" responded Cobus Groenewoud, a director at G4S. ""We have tabled to the committee all the facts available to us."" They told the committee that there was no security camera footage of the cell on the night of Bester's escape due to a power failure. They admitted in questioning that the cell is located near an emergency exit and did not rule out staff collusion in the prison break. Bester's girlfriend Magudumana is a prominent medical doctor and entrepreneur, with more than 100,000 followers on social media where she posted glamorous pictures, promoted her media appearances, and boasted of awards such as the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans of 2018.   Andre Snyman, a crime analyst who founded the South African community crime network eblockwatch and describes himself as ""the agony aunty of crime in South Africa,"" told CNN that he met Bester several years ago and described him as charismatic.  ""He was an incredibly neat, well-groomed, well-spoken and well-dressed man."" He doesn't expect Bester to escape a second time though. ""He's South Africa's Houdini but I don't think he'll get out again.""

                      An elephant living in a Berlin zoo learns how to peel a banana

                      An elephant's trunk is a remarkable organ: a fusion of nose and upper lip, capable of movement via a dense network of muscles. It's strong enough to lift a log, and sensitive enough to perform delicate tasks like picking up a single tortilla chip without breaking it.  Now a team of researchers in Berlin have documented an elephant using her trunk for another novel behavior: peeling bananas. The star of this new study, an Asian elephant named Pang Pha, was a baby when she arrived at the Berlin Zoo in 1987. Like many zoo elephants, she was fed bananas, which most elephants eat by picking them up with their trunks and scarfing them down whole, peel and all.  But Pang Pha was ""the little princess of the caretakers,"" said Michael Brecht, a professor of neurobiology at Humboldt University in Berlin and the senior author of the study in Current Biology. One of Pang Pha's caretakers took to peeling bananas for her. Years later, she figured out how to do it herself. The zookeepers alerted Brecht and his team, who study how elephants are able to control their trunks. ""When they told us that she can peel bananas, we were of course thrilled,"" said Brecht. But then, in what he describes as a ""funny twist,"" the researchers had a hard time getting Pang Pha to replicate her trick. ""For weeks, we would bring the nicest banana we could find in Berlin to the zoo, and she would always just straight eat it,"" he said. ""There was some head scratching done. and we gradually figured out that it's only brownish bananas that she peels. She never peels a beautiful yellow one.""  If given a banana that's too brown, though, she tosses it aside, he added.  When Pang Pha peels a banana, she doesn't crack the stem and peel down the sides one by one. Rather, she uses her trunk to tear the peel open and then throws the banana to the ground to free it. There are times when she still eats bananas whole, even the lightly brown ones she prefers to peel. When she's with other elephants and they're all being fed bananas, Pang Pha will eat ""like a machine,"" says Brecht, not wasting time (and the opportunity to snag more bananas) by stopping to peel. But in a move that he calls ""quite strategic,"" when there's only one banana left, she'll save it and peel it later. The question of why she peels bananas, and only peels brownish ones, is up in the air — it may have to do with taste, or the ease of peeling bananas in different stages of ripeness. It's also not possible to definitively say that she learned to peel bananas by copying her human caretaker.  ""It's definitely possible that this was learned, but it is also possible that the elephant, who I assume has eaten lots of bananas, figured out how to do this on their own and liked the taste of a peeled banana better than one unpeeled,"" Joshua Plotnik, an assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College in New York who studies elephant cognition, said via email.  Plotnik, who was not involved with the study, says he's witnessed elephants peeling bananas before, and that the behavior demonstrates both the dexterity of elephant trunks, and the flexibility of elephant foraging behavior.  ""I am particularly interested in how well adapted elephants are to their environments, especially considering they now live in human-dominated landscapes where change is often unpredictable,"" he said.  Elephants' ability to adapt their behavior goes hand-in-hand (or trunk-in-trunk) with their long lifespans, sometimes more than 80 years. In order to survive for so long, they need to be able to react to and remember new experiences, said Brecht. Learning is ""a big part of elephant life.""  Given the challenges these animals face from human-led habitat destruction and fragmentation, their learning abilities might provide an additional advantage beyond ensuring their day-to-day survival. Brecht said that he hopes that studies shedding light on elephant cognition could help conservation efforts: ""If people know that these are wonderful animals, it might bolster their efforts to protect them.""

                      Warships from the Russian Pacific Fleet are conducting anti-submarine exercises in waters off the country's far eastern coast, Russia's Pacific Fleet press service said on Thursday morning. The exercises involve three corvette warships tasked with locating and destroying a mock enemy submarine with the assistance of helicopters in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.  ""Before the corvettes went out to sea, the siren was set off on board, prompting the crews to practice for emergency measures to put the ships in a state of combat-readiness and for the [military] campaign"" the Pacific Fleet press service said. The fleet also engaged in other anti-aircraft and anti-submarine defense drills. The final stage of the exercises will involve ""ship-based counter-sabotage support units with practical counter-sabotage grenade-launching,"" it said. The exercises were at least the second in less than three weeks that the Russia navy has performed in the same waters. In late March, Russian missile boats fired cruise missiles at a mock target in the Sea of Japan, the Defense Ministry said. ""A team of two missile boats carried out a joint missile strike against a sea shield simulating a simulated enemy warship,"" the ministry said in a Telegram post at the time. ""The target was successfully engaged at a distance of 100 kilometers (62 miles) by a direct hit from two Moskit cruise missiles,"" the ministry said. Tensions between Japan and Russia have been increasing in recent months, fueled by Japan's support of Ukraine after Russia's invasion.  Thursday's exercise comes less than a month after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made a surprise visit to Ukraine. That same day, two Russian strategic bomber planes, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, flew over waters off the Japanese coast for more than seven hours in what Moscow said was a ""planned flight,"" Reuters reported. Kishida has previously spoken out forcefully against Russia's invasion of its neighbor, warning last year that ""Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow."" And last month, after pledging additional aid to Ukraine on the eve of the invasion's first anniversary, Kishida said, ""Russia's aggression against Ukraine is not just a European matter, but a challenge to the rules and principles of the entire international community."" Japan and Russia are also embroiled in a decades-long territorial dispute. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a dispute that dates to the end of World War II, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan.

                      Japan's population has fallen for the 12th consecutive year, as deaths rise and the birth rate continues to sink, according to government data released Wednesday. The population stood at 124.49 million in 2022 -- representing a decline of 556,000 from the previous year, figures show. That figure represents both the natural change in population -- meaning deaths and births -- and the flow of people entering and exiting the country. The natural change last year was the biggest on record, with a fall of 731,000 -- cushioned by the influx of people entering Japan, which provided an increase of 175,000, said Cabinet Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno in a news conference on Wednesday. ""It is essential to take firm measures to address the declining birthrate, which is a major factor in the decline in population, as one of the top priority issues to be addressed,"" said Matsuno. Japan has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, as well as one of the highest life expectancies; in 2020, nearly one in 1,500 people in Japan were age 100 or older, according to government data. That means a swelling elderly population, shrinking workforce, and not enough young people to fill in the gaps -- posing a demographic crisis decades in the making. The trend is seen across the country, with all of Japan's 47 prefectures except Tokyo reporting a decline in residents last year, according to the data released Wednesday. One village in central Japan recorded just one newborn child in 25 years -- a birth that was heralded as a miracle for the town's elderly residents. The situation is so dire that Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned lawmakers in January that the country is ""on the brink of not being able to maintain social functions"" due to the falling birth rate.  He added that child-rearing support was the government's ""most important policy,"" and solving the issue ""simply cannot wait any longer."" Trouble ahead Some researchers and climate scientists argue that population decline could benefit our battered ecosystems and lower emissions as the climate crisis worsens. But it also spells trouble for countries like Japan, with fewer workers to fund pensions and healthcare, and fewer people to look after the elderly. In April, Japan launched its new Children and Families Agency, which focuses on measures to support parents such as establishing more daycare centers, and provides youth services such as counseling. Previous similar initiatives, often carried out by local authorities, have so far failed to turn things around. Busy urban lifestyles and long working hours leave little time for some Japanese to start families, and the rising costs of living that mean having a baby is simply too expensive for many young people.  In 2022, Japan was ranked one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child, according to research from financial institution Jefferies. And yet, the country's economy has stalled since the early 1990s, meaning frustratingly low wages and little upward mobility. The drop in the number of Japanese nationals in the past year also highlights the government's deeply conservative views on immigration. Foreigners accounted for just 2.2% of the population in 2021, according to the Japanese government, compared to 13.6% in the United States.  These attitudes are widespread among the public, too; a 2021 study by the Pew Research Center found that about half of Japanese adults say having a diverse society makes their country a worse place to live -- though this percentage is lower than in previous years.

                      Japan's workers still aren't getting paid enough to keep up with rising prices. That's hurting living standards and creating a major headache for the country's new central bank chief as he marks his first week on the job. Adjusted for inflation, wages slipped 2.6% in February, compared to the same month a year earlier, according to government data released last week. That marked nearly a year -— 11 straight months — of declines despite a major campaign by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to hike compensation. Economists say the issue will likely continue to dog the Bank of Japan's new governor, Kazuo Ueda, who took the helm over the weekend and is facing pressure to do away with the ultra-loose monetary policy of his predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda. With inflation hitting 3.1% in February, above the central bank's 2% target, it should be time for the the BOJ to end its massive stimulus program. But, consumer prices are mainly being driven higher by rising import costs, rather than strong domestic demand. That means it'll be tough for Ueda to hike interest rates, especially as living standards aren't rising either. Ueda's predecessor was the main architect of aggressive, ""bazooka"" style stimulus measures intended to boost Japan's economy after decades of stagnation. Kuroda's signature ultra-easy monetary policy has been criticized for distorting markets, even as it succeeded in weakening the yen and boosting exports.  Any move to ditch it, though, could risk more problems, if conditions aren't right.  If Ueda tightens monetary policy before solid and steady growth is achieved, it would end up cooling demand and damaging the economy. That's why robust growth in wages must be established before the BOJ can start hiking rates, according to economists.  ""The stagnant wage rise will leave Ueda no choice but to maintain the short-term [interest] policy rate at effectively zero in the coming years,"" said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics at Oxford Economics. ""What he will do in the coming months is to simply make the super-easy policy more sustainable."" Prime Minister Kishida has been urging businesses to help workers keep up with higher living costs. The issue of stagnant wages could improve this year, as companies heed the call to raise salaries in response to inflation. Salary negotiations Last month, Rengo, the country's largest labor group, said more than 800 unions and their employers had reached preliminary agreements to increase wages by an average of 3.8%.  That would mark the highest rate of raises since 2013, the organization said. New payrolls are expected to kick in this month, which marks the beginning of the fiscal year. Economists say this may help. ""The wage hikes announced at spring wage negotiations so far are a good start, but it's too soon to say much about the macroeconomic impact,"" said Stefan Angrick, a Tokyo-based senior economist at Moody's Analytics. Like other parts of the world, inflation in Japan has become a headache. Angrick noted that core consumer prices, excluding fresh food, did tick down in February, from 4.2% the previous month to 3.1%, thanks to government support for household energy bills. That's low by comparison with America or Europe. But in Japan, it's high enough to feel uncomfortable, given stagnant wage growth, according to Angrick. He said although overall wage gains this year were expected to exceed those in previous years, the pay bumps are unlikely to be able to keep up with inflation.  A delicate balance The BOJ has deployed its ultra-easy policy since Kuroda, who completed his 10-year term over the weekend, took the reins in 2013. Then, in 2016, after years of aggressive bond buying failed to push up prices, it introduced the yield curve control (YCC) program, where it bought targeted amounts of bonds to push down yields, in order to stoke inflation and stimulate growth. As part of that program, the central bank targeted some short-term interest rates at an ultra-dovish minus 0.1% and aimed for 10-year government bond yields around 0%. But as prices rose and interest rates elsewhere went up, pressure has grown on the BOJ to wind down the program. ""The BOJ is caught between financial markets anticipating a policy pivot and the recognition that [a] premature exit would likely derail the economy and any hope of achieving the kind of sustained, demand-driven 2% inflation the bank is aiming for,"" said Angrick.  ""At the same time, consumer price inflation is still uncomfortably high. All of this requires careful maneuvering and communication."" In December, the BOJ shocked global markets by allowing the 10-year government bond yield to move 50 basis points on either side of its 0% target.  The move stoked speculation the central bank may follow the same direction as other major economies by allowing rates to rise further — and underscored how all eyes were on the bank over even the slightest adjustments.  — Juliana Liu, Laura He and Moeri Karasawa contributed to this report.

                      Arkansas governor signs sweeping bill imposing a minimum age limit for social media usage

                      Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has signed a sweeping bill imposing a minimum age limit for social media usage, in the latest example of states taking more aggressive steps intended to protect teens online. But even as Sanders signed the bill into law on Wednesday afternoon, the legislation appeared to contain vast loopholes and exemptions benefiting companies that lobbied on the bill and raising questions about how much of the industry it truly covers.  The legislation, known as the Social Media Safety Act and taking effect in September, is aimed at giving parents more control over their kids' social media usage, according to lawmakers. It defines social media companies as any online forum that lets users create public profiles and interact with each other through digital content.   It requires companies that operate those services to verify the ages of all new users and, if the users are under 18 years old, to obtain a parent's consent before allowing them to create an account. To perform the age checks, the law relies on third-party companies to verify users' personal information, such as a driver's license or photo ID. ""While social media can be a great tool and a wonderful resource, it can have a massive negative impact on our kids,"" Sanders said at a press conference before signing the bill. Utah finalized a similar law last month, raising concerns among some users and advocacy groups that the legislation could make user data less secure, internet access less private and infringe upon younger users' basic rights.  The push by states to legislate on social media comes after years of mounting scrutiny of the industry and claims that it has harmed users' well-being and mental health, particularly among teens.   Despite its seemingly universal scope, however, the new law, also known as SB396, includes numerous carveouts for certain types of digital services and, in some cases, individual companies. And although its sponsors have said the law is specifically meant to apply to certain platforms, including TikTok, parts of the legislative language appear to result in the exact opposite effect.  In the final days of negotiation over the bill, Arkansas lawmakers approved an amendment that created several categorical exemptions from the age verification requirements. Media companies that ""exclusively"" offer subscription content; social media platforms that permit users to ""generate short video clips of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment""; and companies that ""exclusively offer"" video gaming-focused social networking features were exempted.   Another amendment carved out companies that sell cloud storage services, business cybersecurity services or educational technology and that simultaneously derive less than 25% of their total revenue from running a social media platform.   Sen. Tyler Dees, a lead co-sponsor of the legislation, explained in remarks on the Arkansas senate floor on April 6 that the exemptions and tweaks to the bill, some of which he said were made in consultation with Apple, Meta and Google, were intended to shield non-social media services from the bill's age requirements and to focus attention on new accounts created by children, not existing adult accounts.  ""There's other services that Google offers ... like cloud storage, et cetera,"" Dees said. ""So that's really the intent of carving out — like LinkedIn, that is a social -- I'm sorry, that is a business networking site, and so that's the intent of those bills.""  Microsoft-owned LinkedIn is apparently exempt from SB396 under a provision that carves out companies that provide ""career development opportunities, including professional networking, job skills, learning certifications, and job posting and application services.""  Other lawmakers have questioned whether the legislation — which has now become law — exempts a giant of the social media industry: YouTube, whose auto-play features and algorithmic recommendation engine have been accused of promoting extremism and radicalizing viewers.   The confusion over YouTube appears to stem from the carveout for businesses that offer cloud storage and that make less than 25% of their revenue from social media.   What is unclear is whether YouTube is subject to SB396 because it is a distinct company within Google whose revenue comes almost entirely from operating a social media platform, or whether it is not covered because YouTube is a part of Google and Google is exempt because it derives only a small share of its revenues from YouTube.   In response to questions by CNN, Dees said SB396 targets platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, but omitted any mention of Google and declined to answer whether YouTube specifically would be covered by the law.   ""The purpose of this bill was to empower parents and protect kids from social media platforms, like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat,"" Dees said in a statement. ""We worked with stakeholders to ensure that email, text messaging, video streaming, and networking websites were not covered by the bill.""  In remarks at Wednesday's bill signing, Sanders told reporters that Google and Amazon are exempted from the law, implying that YouTube will not be subject to the age verification requirements imposed on other major social media sites.  Meanwhile, Dees' statement appeared to contradict the language in SB396 that purports to exempt any company that ""allows a user to generate short video clips of dancing, voice overs, or other acts of entertainment in which the primary purpose is not educational or informative"" — content that can be commonly found on TikTok, Snapchat and the other social media platforms Deese named.   According to Meta spokesperson, ""We want teens to be safe online. We've developed more than 30 tools to support teens and families, including tools that let parents and teens work together to limit the amount of time teens spend on Instagram, and age-verification technology that helps teens have age-appropriate experiences.""  Meta ""automatically set teens' accounts to private when they join Instagram, we've further restricted the options advertisers have to reach teens, as well as the information we use to show ads to teens... and we don't allow content that promotes suicide, self-harm or eating disorders,"" according to the spokesperson, who added: ""We'll continue to work closely with experts, policymakers and parents on these important issues.""  Spokespeople for Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

                      Uber is funding a new program that aims to get electric bikes with dangerous non-certified lithium-ion batteries off New York City streets. The company said on Wednesday it will soon allow the thousands of New York City delivery workers who use e-bikes the ability to trade-in their bikes for newer, safer models. The news follows a string of fires caused by lithium-ion batteries, which have been known to overheat when charging and cause massive explosions.  Earlier this week, the New York City police department said an e-bike's lithium-ion battery was behind a fatal two-alarm fire in Queens. The FDNY's Chief fire marshal John Hodgens said it was the 59th fire in the city this year caused by a lithium-ion battery. Part of the issue is that not all lithium-ion batteries are created equal. UL-certified electric bikes and scooters come from reputable retailers and undergo extensive battery safety tests. But other online marketplaces, which some delivery workers may have turned to for more affordable options in the absence of company-provided options or subsidies, often make it hard to tell the origin of these products and the quality of their batteries.  To get more UL-certified e-bikes on roads, Uber is now partnering with e-bike company Zoomo to offer credit to delivery workers willing to swap their existing e-bikes for ones with higher-quality batteries. It will also offer rent-to-own pricing models and priority access to repairs and services.  Uber is also piloting a trade-in program with The Equitable Commute Project, a non-profit, to provide discounted UL-certified e-bikes in exchange for a ""noncompliant device."" ""Delivery workers should not have to choose between making a living and safety,"" said Josh Gold, Uber's senior director for public policy, in a statement. ""By providing discounts and exchange opportunities for new UL certified e-bikes and certified lithium-ion batteries, the expensive price tag that too often acts as a blocker to safety should no longer have to be a concern."" Steve Kerber, vice president and executive director of UL's Fire Safety Research Institute, previously told CNN the number of lithium-ion battery-based fires is growing with enormous frequency both in the United States and internationally, particularly when it comes to e-bikes and e-scooters. That's due to an uptick in purchases of these products during the pandemic. ""People started to get overcharged for them and turned to manufacturers which happened to have lower quality control with the battery systems,"" Kerber said. ""The quality manufacturers are not having issues."" Despite the concerns, lithium-ion batteries continue to be prevalent in today's most popular gadgets, from smartphones and laptops to e-bikes and scooters. Some tech companies point to their abilities to charge faster, last longer and pack more power into a lighter package.  But Dylan Khoo, an analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research, previously told CNN that electric bikes and scooters use batteries which can be around 50 times larger than the one in a smartphone. ""So when a fire does happen, it's much more dangerous,"" Khoo said. All lithium-ion batteries use flammable materials, and incidents are likely the result of ""thermal runaway,"" a chain reaction which can lead to a fire or catastrophic explosion, according to Khoo. ""This process can be triggered by a battery overheating, being punctured, or an electrical fault like a short circuit,"" Khoo said. ""In cases where fires occur spontaneously while charging, it is likely due to manufacturing defects."" Anyone with a lithium-ion battery should follow proper charging and battery usage guidelines, such as keeping them in a cool, dry place, and not leave it charging for too long or while you're asleep. Batteries should also be routinely inspected to make sure there is no cracking, bulging or leaking, and people should always use the charger that came with the device or use one from a reputable supplier, according to researchers at the University of Michigan.

                      America's largest bank is ending pandemic-era hybrid work for its senior staff. ""Our leaders play a critical role in reinforcing our culture and running our businesses,"" JPMorgan Chase told staff in a memo. ""They have to be visible on the floor, they must meet with clients... and they should always be accessible for immediate feedback and impromptu meetings."" Wall Street giants like JPMorgan have been among the most vocal proponents of returning to a pre-pandemic office regimen. That was true even in the fall of 2020, before new Covid variants emerged and scuttled banks' back-to-office plans. But as infection rates have fallen, bosses across Corporate America have been itching to get their staffs back under one roof.  While there is still no standard way to measure the full extent of remote work, one report from Kastle Systems, which operates card-swipe security machines, said that the weekly average office occupancy rate at the end of March in the most populous U.S. cities was 49% of pre-pandemic levels.  JPMorgan said it would maintain hybrid working options for thousands of employees who are required to have three days in the office. In the memo, the bank issued a warning to staffers who are struggling to hit that minimum. ""There are a number of employees who aren't meeting their in-office attendance expectations, and that must change,"" the note reads, adding that managers would be responsible for taking ""corrective action"" if employees don't comply.  Another motivation for JPMorgan: A year ago, the bank unveiled a design for a new global headquarters in New York. The 60-story skyscraper was touted as the city's ""largest all-electric tower with net zero operational emissions."" When it opens in 2025, it'll have space for 14,000 employees and offer ample public green space along 49th Street and Park Avenue.

                      Inflation hits the mailbox: Postage stamp prices are rising, again

                      Stamp prices are set to tick up. The US Postal Service said Monday that it filed a notice with its regulators to increase prices on first-class mail stamps to 66 cents from 63 cents. If approved, the change would take effect in July, raising the cost of mailing a first-class letter by about 5.4%. The Postal Service said the hike was necessary to offset a rise in operating expenses.  Surging prices have dented business across the global economy over the past two years, pushing up workers' wages and increasing the costs of doing business. Although inflation has been cooling over the past nine months — prices were up 5% last month on an annual basis — it remains above the central bank's target of around 2%. ""These price adjustments are needed to provide the Postal Service with much needed revenue,"" the agency said in a statement. If the latest hike is approved, it would amount to a 32% increase over the past four years. Domestic postcards will also increase from 48 cents to 51 cents, and international postcards from $1.45 to $1.50. It's rare, but not unheard of, for the regulators to decline USPS requests; they did so in 2010. The Postal Regulatory Commission denied a price hike because, according to its statement at the time, USPS ""failed both to quantify the impact of the recession on its finances and to show how its rate request relates to the resulting loss of mail volume."" First-class mail is becoming a smaller part of the Postal Service's business because of online communication. The number of individual letters sent each year has fallen by about half in the past decade. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, appointed during the Trump administration, has pursued sweeping changes during his tenure to try to bolster the agency's finances. USPS expects to lose $4.5 billion in 2023.

                      The banking crisis will tilt US into recession, say Fed economists

                      The fallout from the recent banking crisis is likely to push the US economy into a mild recession later this year, according to notes from the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting, released on Wednesday.  Since November 2022, staff economists at the Federal Reserve have predicted subdued growth and a weakening economy during policy decision meetings. in March, they said the banking crisis heightened that forecast to a recession.  Taking into account ""the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments,"" Fed economists' ""projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year,"" noted minutes from the Fed's most recent two-day monetary policy meeting on March 21-22.  This is the first time in the current hiking cycle that staff economists have forecast such a recession.  ""The main takeaway from Wednesday's Federal Reserve minutes is that the central bank anticipates a mild recession in late 2023 and that the soft landing window seems to be closing quickly,"" said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management, in a note Wednesday.  Policymakers at the Fed voted unanimously last month for a smaller interest rate increase after turbulence in the banking industry set off fears of bank runs, according to the minutes. The notes, released on Wednesday afternoon, highlighted the uncertainty behind the decision, which came just days after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Fed officials raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point, the ninth-rate hike in a row. ""Some participants noted that given persistently high inflation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a [half percentage point] increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector,"" according to the minutes. Given those projections and their own economic uncertainty, policymakers judged it ""prudent to increase the target range by a smaller increment at this meeting."" Policymakers also noted that actions taken by the Fed and other government agencies to mitigate possible contagion and secure the US financial system had successfully quelled immediate fears and and calmed conditions in the banking sector. Because of that, they said, they thought it was appropriate to address strong economic data and sticky inflation rates by raising rates by a quarter point instead of pausing all together. The Fed's latest interest rate increase brought the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, the highest level since September 2007. But the banking stress, coupled with slowing inflation and a cooling labor market, could signal the imminent end of the Fed's rate-hiking campaign. The Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched inflation gauge, rose 5% in March from a year earlier, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That marks the ninth-straight month that headline inflation has slowed. While bank failures can erode confidence in the banking industry, they can make borrowing harder, which can also curb spending and ease some pressure on prices and the labor market, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference following the conclusion of the March policymaking meeting. ""Such a tightening in financial conditions would work in the same direction as rate tightening,"" Powell said, stressing that the banking industry remained sound. The meeting minutes echoed that sentiment. Recent developments in the banking sector, they said, ""were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,"" though policymakers were unsure of the extent of the economic fallout. ""Participants agreed that the extent of these effects was uncertain,"" said the notes. SVB's collapse was the second-largest bank failure in US history and underpins the worst banking crisis since the Great Recession. The bank, which had over $200 billion in total assets at the end of last year, primarily provided banking services to venture-backed technology companies. The turbulence in the technology industry meant many customers were burning through cash and taking out their money at a faster pace. In early March, SVB sought to raise capital from investors and announced that it had sold some securities at a loss and would sell $2.25 billion in new shares to plug the hole in its finances. Customers panicked, attempted to withdraw close to $100 billion from the bank, and regulators took over a few days later. Signature Bank was the other casualty of the US banking industry's turmoil last month and, later, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, which was forced to merge with its longtime rival UBS as a remedy. The Fed now has to balance taming still-high inflation, ensuring financial stability and factoring in other economic shocks, like the recent surprise decision from OPEC+ to cut global oil production. Meanwhile, congressional lawmakers such as Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren have called for investigations into the bank failures and legislating additional rules such as raising the FDIC insurance limit for deposits.

                      The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software.  Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to a tweet last week from the FBI's Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples.  ""Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,"" the agency advised in the tweet. While public charging stations are attractive to many when devices are running critically low on battery, security experts have for years raised concerns about the risk. In 2011, researchers coined the term ""juice jacking"" to describe the problem. ""Just by plugging your phone into a [compromised] power strip or charger, your device is now infected, and that compromises all your data,"" Drew Paik, formerly of security firm Authentic8, explained to CNN in 2017. The cord you use to charge your phone is also used to send data from your phone to other devices. For instance, when you plug your iPhone into your Mac with the charging cord, you can download photos from your phone to your computer.  If a port is compromised, there's no limit to what information a hacker could take, Paik previously explained to CNN. That includes your email, text messages, photos and contacts.  ""The FBI regularly provides reminders and public service announcements in conjunction with our partners,"" Vikki Migoya, public affairs officer at the FBI's Denver branch, told CNN. ""This was a general reminder for the American public to stay safe and diligent, especially while traveling."" The Federal Communications Commission also updated a blog post on Tuesday warning that a corrupted charging port can allow a malicious actor to lock a device or extract personal data and passwords.  ""In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations,"" according to the FCC blog post. ""There have even been reports of infected cables being given away as promotional gifts.""

                      Warren Buffett wants harsher penalties for top leaders of failed banks

                      Billionaire investor Warren Buffett isn't worried about the state of the US banking industry — but he would like to see much tougher consequences for top leaders of the banks that fail. In the wake of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Buffett reflected on the public's frustration after the 2008 financial crisis. ""All kinds of trouble [was] caused by the banks. But bank executives ... they all continue to live fine. They may have lost their job, but they got their pensions,"" he said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC. ""There have got to be consequences to the people who make the decisions. Penalizing the shareholders later on by billions of dollars worth of fines ... that doesn't deter the bad action."" Specifically, Buffett thinks presidents and CEOs of failed banks should lose their retirement savings and that directors should have to return five years' worth of their lucrative salaries.  He admitted neither is likely to happen. ""That will not be met by great enthusiasm from a lot of friends of mine,"" he said. ""I don't know anybody that went back to flipping burgers at McDonald's or something, after they screwed up the system in a big way in 2008 and '09."" Still, he agrees with a number of banking experts who say the problems exposed over the last month following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank are nowhere near as bad as the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett also noted that customers of SVB and Signature Bank — a New York bank that failed shortly after SVB — don't have to worry about losing their money because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has guaranteed all deposits for those two banks — even those above the normal $250,000 limit. The FDIC's move was an extraordinary one, and Buffett said it gives him confidence about the state of the industry. It will be the banks, not US taxpayers, who will have to pay if the costs of bank failures rise, he added. Berkshire's bank sell-off The lack of penalties for bank leaders is one reason Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off most of its bank stocks, including some the company held for 30 years, he said. ""I just think the system isn't quite right in terms of connecting punishment to culprits on something that is so important,"" he said. Stiffer penalties would also help bolster both investors' and bank customers' confidence in the banking system, Buffett said, noting that ""there is no penalty attached to bad behavior and it does really, really affect the system when people lose confidence in banks."" As the fall of SVB showed, that confidence can be lost ""in seconds,"" Buffett said. ""We saw a country that was not worried about banks until about Wednesday or Thursday of the week when Silicon Valley [collapsed], and all of a sudden everybody was all worried about it [the banking system] all over the country."" Yet thanks to the FDIC, Buffett said, depositors don't need to worry. In fact, he said he would bet $1 million that no US bank depositors will lose money over the next year and invited someone else to put up $1 million that there will be losses — with the winner determining which charity would get the $2 million at the end of the year. Buffett also weighed in about the blame some place on Federal Reserve for the current banking crisis. Critics have slammed the lack of bank oversight and say the Fed raised interest rates so quickly that the Treasuries held by banks lost more value than banks expected. But Buffett has only praise for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. ""I do not think I could run the Fed as well as Jay Powell has done,"" Buffett said. ""He's been terrific.""

                      Juul to pay $462 million to six states in its largest settlement ever

                      Juul Labs, the e-cigarette maker, is paying $462 million to six US states and DC in the largest multi-state settlement yet for the troubled company that has been accused of contributing to the rise of vaping among youth.  The settlement, which was co-led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Rob Bonta, will force retailers to secure Juul products behind counters and verify the age of purchasers, and Juul must cease using people under 35 years old in its marketing materials that directly or indirectly target young people.  Wednesday's announcement ""places the most stringent restrictions on Juul's marketing, sales, and distribution practices in order to protect and prevent minors from underage smoking,"" according to a release from the New York's AG office. ""Juul lit a nationwide public health crisis by putting addictive products in the hands of minors and convincing them that it's harmless. Today they are paying the price for the harm they caused,"" James said in the statement. New York is receiving nearly $113 million and will use the money to fund programs that deter underage smoking. The lawsuit accuses Juul of directly promoting its products to high school students, including in one instance where a Juul representative ""falsely told high school freshmen that its products were safer than cigarettes."" It also said the company's ad campaign reached teens across the US, who then told their friends about Juul in ""rapid numbers."" Juul said that this settlement means the company is ""nearing total resolution"" of its ""historical legal challenges and securing certainty for our future,"" which now total more than $1 billion.   ""Now we are positioned to dedicate even greater focus on our path forward to maximize the value and impact of our product technology and scientific foundation,"" a Juul spokesperson told CNN.  E-cigarette usage among New York City high school students soared from 8% in 2014, a year prior to Juul's launch, to to 23.5% in 2018, and caused to 2,500 hospitalizations for vaping-related illnesses, according to the release.  About 2.55 million middle and high school students in the US used e-cigarettes in 2022, according to researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration. Based on responses to the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey, 14.1% of high school students and 3.3% of middle school students reported using e-cigarettes within the previous 30 days. Of those, 42.3% reported using them frequently, and 27.6% of them reported daily use. Other states are also receiving substantial amounts of money from this settlement, which will be paid out over an 8-year period. California is getting $175.8 million, Illinois is getting $67.6 million, Massachusetts is getting $41.7 million, Colorado is getting $31.7 million, New Mexico is getting $17 million and District of Columbia is getting $15 million. Other lawsuits This lawsuit is the second this week that Juul has settled. West Virginia said on Monday that Juul is paying $7.9 million for similar accusations of marketing toward youth. Last December, Juul Labs announced it settled more than 5,000 cases brought by approximately 10,000 plaintiffs in the US, resolving a substantial amount of legal issues for the company. The company said the cases were variously personal injury, consumer class action, or from government entity and Native American tribe groups, but did not disclose the settlement amount. That followed a September announcement that Juul would pay $438.5 million to 34 states and territories after a two-year investigation into its marketing and sales practices -- like in West Virginia, Juul was charged with deliberately marketing its products to young people. At one point, Juul was selling some of the most popular vapes in the US, especially the flavored products which the company stopped selling in 2019. Last summer, the FDA ordered Juul products to be removed from the US market. A court temporarily blocked the FDA ban, so products are still for sale in the country.

                      The Shelby County Board of Commissioners on Wednesday voted to confirm the reappointment of Justin J. Pearson to the Tennessee House of Representatives, sending him back to fill the House District 86 seat as an interim representative.   The vote to return Pearson to his seat -- vacated last Thursday when the GOP-dominated chamber expelled the state representative after he and two other Democrats called for gun reform on the chamber floor -- came after the board voted to suspend a rule that would have required a waiting period between his nomination and confirmation.   The vote to appoint Pearson passed 7-0.   ""You cannot expel hope,"" a triumphant Pearson told cheering supporters at the boisterous meeting Wednesday. ""You can't expel our voice and you sure can't expel our fight. We look forward to continuing to fight, continuing to advocate."" Shelby County commissioners voted Wednesday on appointing Pearson to the House District 86 seat, which the 28-year-old vacated last week when he was forced out in a two-thirds majority vote by the GOP-dominated body after he and two Democratic colleagues participated in a demonstration calling for gun reform on the chamber floor.  ""Democracy will win in the end,"" Pearson told CNN after being reappointed Wednesday.  A rally in support of Pearson took place about a mile away at the National Civil Rights Museum before the Shelby County Board of Commissioners met at 1:30 p.m. local time to take up the matter of his vacant seat. ""The status quo needs changing and the status quo needs you,"" Pearson told the crowd before the meeting.  Later, Pearson raised his fist in the air as supporters cheered him before the vote at the meeting.  ""We've got a problem in Nashville and it's called a promise that they're holding onto with the status quo. Their allegiance is to the way that things are. Their allegiance is to business as usual. Their allegiance is to the National Rifle Association."" Pearson and Rep. Justin Jones, who are Black, were expelled, though Jones was reinstated as an interim member and returned to the state House victorious Monday, following a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council. Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is White and participated in the demonstration on the floor of the House, survived the vote last week and kept her seat. Tennessee law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held, and the vote to appoint Pearson had been expected to follow a similar process to Jones' earlier this week.  ""The Republican-led supermajority of the Tennessee General Assembly sought to have a political lynching of three of its members because we spoke out of turn against the status quo of the government, after the tragic deaths of six people in the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville,"" Pearson said at an Easter Sunday service at The Church of the River in Memphis.  In a statement over the weekend, Shelby County Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery said he believed Pearson's expulsion ""was conducted in a hasty manner without consideration of other corrective action methods.""  ""I am certain that the leaders in the State Capitol understand the importance of this action on behalf of the affected citizens here in Shelby County, Tennessee and that we stand ready to work in concert with them to assist with only positive outcomes going forward,"" Lowery's statement said.  'A clear message' The lawmakers' expulsions came as the long-simmering debate over guns in America boiled over in Tennessee following a mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead, including three 9-year-old children. Jones, Pearson and Johnson took to the state House floor to advocate for gun control, using a bullhorn to address their colleagues and demonstrators who had gathered at the Capitol.  Republicans accused the trio of ""knowingly and intentionally"" bringing ""disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives"" without being recognized to speak, and they filed three resolutions seeking their ousters. The vote to remove Jones and Pearson happened last Thursday -- a move the expelled representatives called undemocratic and racist.  On Monday, Jones and his supporters marched the four blocks from City Hall to the Capitol after a resounding 36-0 vote by Nashville council members, reinstating him as an interim representative for House District 52.  ""Today we are sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence,"" Jones said. ""Today we send a clear message to Speaker (of the House) Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge."" ""To anyone who has doubted the South, anyone who's doubted the power of Tennesseans to advocate for an end to gun violence, anybody who's doubted the movement to end assault weapons -- anybody who's doubted the movement, here's your answer: The movement still lives,"" Pearson said Monday as he stood on the steps of the Capitol alongside Jones. Sexton earlier indicated he would not stand in the way of the appointments should local officials choose to send Jones and Pearson back to the chamber. ""The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats,"" a spokesperson for the speaker's office told CNN on Monday. ""Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires."" Upon his return -- and in the wake of not only the mass shooting in Nashville, but another shooting Monday at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky -- Jones indicated he would continue to call for gun reform legislation. The Louisville shooting is a ""painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like Cameron Sexton and the Republican Party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all of the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,"" Pearson told CNN. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the day of the vote to reappoint Pearson. It was Wednesday.

Follow live updates The call, which came in at 8:41 a.m. Monday, was one of a number of 911 calls released to the public Wednesday detailing the panic and fear during the mass shooting, in which the gunman, 25-year-old bank employee Connor Sturgeon, used a recently purchased AR-15-style rifle to shoot his coworkers and responding officers before he was shot dead by police. The attacker livestreamed the gruesome assault, which took place about 30 minutes before the bank was set to open, authorities said.  Five people were killed, and three remained hospitalized as of Tuesday, including Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie police officer who just graduated from the police academy 10 days earlier and was shot in the head. One 911 caller tells an operator an officer was down, having fallen right after their arrival. ""I just wanted to make sure you understood that there was an officer down,"" the man tells the operator, ""There are several officers here now, but the one hasn't moved since he's been shot. ... I haven't seen a foot or anything moving.""  The release of the files came just before officials in Louisville hosted a vigil to grieve the victims and as the gunman's family released a statement outlining his mental health challenges. Police on Tuesday also released dramatic police body camera footage showing the response to the shooting. The attack was just one of more than 145 shootings reported in the US this year with at least four people shot, excluding the shooter. Bank employee told 911 she saw shooting on video According to the audio files, the first caller to 911 came from a woman who works at a different branch of Old National Bank and witnessed the shooting on video. ""How do you know you have an active shooter on site?"" the operator asked. ""I just watched it. I just watched it on a Teams meeting. We were having a board meeting,"" she said. ""I saw somebody on the floor. We heard multiple shots and people started saying 'Oh my God,' and then he came into the board room."" Another caller, speaking in a whisper, said she works at the bank and is hiding in a closet. While on the line, several gunshots can be heard in the background. ""I know who it is,"" the caller said. ""He works with us."" Later an employee in the building asked 911 for a situation report.    ""We are on the fourth floor. We are trying to get the status of what's going on,"" the caller says, ""We're tucked under a desk right now."" The 911 operator calmly tells the caller to remain in place as police officers clear the building, saying, ""As far as my understanding, the shooter has been taken into custody. As far as my understanding, the scene is safe at the moment.""  Staff members were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the gunman opened fire, manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN on Tuesday. She said the massacre ""happened very quickly."" Buchheit-Sims attended the staff meeting virtually and watched in horror as gunfire exploded on her computer screen. ""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she told CNN. ""I don't know how else to say that."" Family says gunman had depression In a statement released Wednesday, the gunman's family laid out his mental health challenges but said they never saw any warnings signs of such an attack. ""While Connor, like many of his contemporaries, had mental health challenges which we, as a family, were actively addressing, there were never any warning signs or indications he was capable of this shocking act,"" Sturgeon's family said in a statement to CNN affiliate WDRB.  The family said it has many ""unanswered questions"" and is cooperating with the investigation. ""No words can express our sorrow, anguish, and horror at the unthinkable harm our son Connor inflicted on innocent people, their families, and the entire Louisville community,"" the statement read.  ""We mourn their loss and that of our son, Connor. We pray for everyone traumatized by his senseless acts of violence and are deeply grateful for the bravery and heroism of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department."" A former high school classmate of Sturgeon's who knew him and his family well said he never saw any ""sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen."" ""This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,"" said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense. I can't believe it."" It's still unclear what provoked the shooter to go on the deadly rampage. Sturgeon legally purchased the AR-15-style rifle -- the choice weapon of many US mass shooters -- six days before the attack, police have said. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the US: no ""Red flag"" laws, no universal background checks, permitless concealed carry and no waiting period between buying a firearm and taking possession of it. Those relaxed gun laws, experts say, help explain why the state has a firearm death rate higher than the national average, according to the CDC. What the body camera footage shows On Tuesday, Louisville police released bodycam video and bystander footage showing the officers' response to the mass shooting. The public footage begins with a video from Officer Wilt, who drove up to the scene with his training officer, Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. As Wilt ran toward the gunshots that officers faced upon arrival, he was shot in the head, police said. The released version of Wilt's footage cuts off before he is shot.  Galloway's body camera footage shows him taking fire and then scrambling down some stairs to a safe position behind a planter. He tells other officers he can't see the gunman but notes the gunman is shooting through windows in the front of the bank, the video shows. At some point, Galloway was also shot. The gunfire shattered the bank's lobby glass windows, giving officers a view of his location, Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said.  As other officers arrived on scene, Galloway shot and killed the gunman from the steps in front of the bank, the video shows. ""I think I got him down! I think he's down!"" Galloway said, the video shows. He then advanced toward the building and directed others to check on his fallen colleague. ""Suspect down. Get the officer!"" The bystander footage, also released by police, was recorded across the street from the bank. The video shows Galloway taking cover with his rifle raised and pointed toward the building as he tries to locate the gunman's position. The entire situation -- from when the gunman began firing his assault weapon to when he was killed by police -- lasted for about nine minutes, according to Louisville police Lt. Col. Aaron Cromwell.  Shooting happened in one minute, official says It took the assailant one minute to complete the bloodbath before he stopped and waited for police to arrive, according to footage of the massacre described by a city official to CNN. The shooter had livestreamed the gruesome attack on Instagram. The video has since been taken down. The Instagram video begins by showing an AR-15-style weapon, followed by a worker in the bank saying good morning to the gunman, the official said. The gunman then tried to shoot her in the back but failed because the safety was on and the weapon still needed to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loaded the weapon properly and took the safety off, he shot the worker in the back, the official said.  The assailant then continued his rampage, firing at workers while they tried to outrun him, the official said. The shooter did not go to other populated floors of the bank, the official said. Once the shooter finished firing, he sat in the lobby area that looks out onto the street, apparently waiting for police, the official said. Police arrived about a minute and half later, the official said. Sturgeon had interned at the bank for three summers and been employed there full-time for about two years, his LinkedIn profile showed. The assailant had been notified that he would be fired from the bank, a law enforcement source said Monday. However, the police chief told CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday there ""was no discussion about [the shooter] being terminated, and of course he wasn't fired,"" prior to the shooting. This article has been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.

                      Memphis leaders pass measure that ends police stops for minor infractions, three months after Tyre Nichols' death

                    ","
                      The Memphis City Council on Tuesday passed an ordinance that puts an end to pretextual police stops. The ""Driving Equality Act in Honor of Tyre Nichols,"" named after the 29-year-old Black man who was beaten to death by Memphis officers during a traffic stop, was passed unanimously and will become the practice on Memphis streets. Pretext stops allow police to use minor traffic infractions or broken taillights as grounds to investigate motorists for more serious crimes. Police have defended those kinds of stops, saying they are crucial for fighting possession of illegal drugs, weapons possession, human trafficking and drunken driving.  But civil rights groups say the tactic unfairly targets Black drivers.  The measure passed in Memphis will still allow police to make traffic stops for primary violations -- like aggressive driving -- but pulling someone over for secondary violations or minor infractions -- like a loose bumper or a broken taillight -- will no longer be allowed.  The end of these kinds of stops has been on the list of police reforms that activists had called for since Nichols' death.  Nichols was brutally beaten by city officers on the night of January 7. He required hospitalization after the encounter and died on January 10. 'This is a start for getting justice' Councilwoman Michalyn Easter-Thomas, the sponsor of the ordinance, told CNN affiliate WMC the measure will allow authorities to focus their resources on where they are needed.  ""What this ordinance is not saying, is do not go to those aggressive drivers,"" Easter-Thomas told the affiliate. ""It's not saying we're not looking for counterfeit tags. It's diverting our resources to where we need the most, which is for (the Memphis Police Department) to fight crime for us and for them to be in their communities being supportive and engaging so that we can build our positive decorum between our officers and our community members."" ""We are so pleased,"" Rev. Ayanna Watkins, Executive Director of Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope told CNN by phone. ""This is a start for getting justice for Tyre and all of those unnamed who died in a similar way."" ""It's also a way of being heard,"" Watkins added. ""Our elected officials are there to hear the people and serve the people."" Residents voiced concern about 'pretext stops' A month before Nichols' death, activists and organizers gave a presentation at the city council's public safety committee hearing to highlight their concerns about violent pretextual traffic stops in Memphis they said led to the death or injury of five people since 2013, video from the committee hearing showed. Activists with Decarcerate Memphis made their presentation on December 6, almost exactly one month to the day before Nichols was brutally beaten by members of the now-disbanded SCORPION unit. There was no specific reference to the SCORPION unit during the presentation, a CNN review found. Another measure was tabled Another public safety ordinance was tabled on Tuesday over concerns about community input.  ""It practically cut and pasted policies out of the police and policy handbook,"" Watkins said about the tabled ordinance. ""It would have taken the teeth out of the previous ordinances that were passed like the data transparency ordinance."" The data transparency ordinance, part of a handful of police reforms passed after Nichols' death, allows the public to see who was pulled over, when they were stopped and for what and what the outcomes were, Watkins said. Regular reporting will require ""data regarding traffic stops, arrests, use of force, and complaints,"" according to the ordinance.  In March, the city council passed five public safety ordinances, including requiring an independent review of the department's police academy and barring the use of unmarked vehicles during traffic stops.

                      Justin J. Pearson gave fiery remarks following the vote Wednesday by the Shelby County Board of Commissioners to appoint him to represent the district in the Tennessee House of Representatives after he was expelled last week.  ""Nashville thought they could silence democracy, but they didn't know that the Shelby County Commission was filled with some courageous leaders,"" said Pearson, who will serve on an interim basis in the legislature.  He added, speaking to cheering supporters: ""You can't expel hope. You can't expel justice. You can't expel our voice. And you sure can't expel our fight. We look forward to continuing to fight. Continuing to advocate. Until justice rolls down like water. And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream. Let's get back to work.""  Hear Justin J. Pearson give remarks following his reinstatement from our affiliate WMC: The Shelby County Board of Commissioners on Wednesday voted to confirm the reappointment of Justin J. Pearson to the Tennessee House of Representatives, sending him back to fill the House District 86 seat as an interim representative.    The vote to return Pearson to his seat — vacated last Thursday when the GOP-dominated chamber expelled the state representative after he and two other Democrats called for gun reform on the chamber floor — came after the board voted to suspend a rule that would have required a waiting period between his nomination and confirmation.   Justin J. Pearson arrived at a special meeting of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners Wednesday. The crowd of spectators cheered when he walked into the room. Pearson marched with supporters from the National Civil Rights Museum at The Lorraine Motel. During the meeting, Pearson is expected to be reappointed to the Tennessee House of Representatives for the 86th district on an interim basis. He was expelled from his seat last week after protesting gun violence on the House floor without being recognized. The other state lawmaker who was ousted, Rep. Justin Jones, was reappointed in his Nashville district on Monday. Ousted Democratic lawmaker Justin J. Pearson is now marching to the Shelby County Board of Commissioners, where he is expected to be reappointed to the Tennessee House of Representatives for the 86th district on an interim basis.  Fellow lawmakers Rep. Justin Jones and Rep. Gloria Johnson joined Pearson and a large crowd.  Jones was reinstated to his position Monday after being expelled with Pearson by House Republicans after their demonstration on the floor of the legislature following the deadly Nashville school shooting. Johnson narrowly avoided expulsion.  The vote to remove the two lawmakers, who are Black, caused an uproar in the state with demonstrators coming out to support the young politicians.  “We need to welcome these young voices and not keep them down,"" Johnson said at a rally before the march.  Justin J. Pearson, one of two Democratic lawmakers expelled by the GOP-controlled Tennessee House last week, said he is going to keep fighting because the ""status quo needs changing."" Pearson, speaking to a crowd at a Memphis rally Wednesday, was joined by Rep. Justin Jones, who was recently reappointed after being expelled, and Rep. Gloria Johnson, who narrowly avoided being ousted.  The Shelby County Board of Commissioners is expected to vote later Wednesday at a special meeting in Memphis on whether Pearson will be reappointed on an interim basis. The crowd gathered at the National Civil Rights Museum at The Lorraine Motel before marching to the Shelby County meeting. The lawmakers, who call themselves the ""Tennessee Three,"" came under fire from Republican leadership after holding a gun control protest on the House floor last month without being recognized. Pearson said the protests in support of the lawmakers that followed their expulsion showed that the “movement is still alive."" ""This is the democracy that changes the status quo,"" he said. “But we’ve got news — the status quo needs changing and the status quo needs you, so today we march and we’re going to keep fighting, we’re going to keep pushing, because we believe that this is what democracy looks like.” Johnson supported Pearson, calling for new, younger and more diverse voices in the state capital. She told the Memphis crowd that Pearson is “doing an amazing job lifting your voices in Nashville.” “We need to welcome these young voices and not keep them down,"" she said. Jones said he is confident that Pearson will be reappointed at the special meeting Wednesday afternoon as he led a chant with the crowd: “Forward together, not one step back."" “So when we walk into that chamber tomorrow as representatives again, we must continue the demands that led us there in the first place,"" Jones said. ""That a week after a mass shooting hit Nashville, rather than pass common sense gun laws, they passed a resolution to expel the two youngest Black members in the general assembly."" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee says he will ask the state legislature to bring forth a measure strengthening the state’s gun laws ""to remove individuals who are a threat to themselves or our society (and) to remove them from access to weapons.” ""I’m asking the General Assembly to bring forward an order of protection law,"" the governor said at a news conference Tuesday. ""A new strong order of protection law will provide the broader population cover, safety, from those who are a danger to themselves or the population."" Lee said he would like to see the legislation passed within the current legislative session, which ends in just a few weeks.  He went on to say that he plans to also sign an executive order strengthening the state’s gun background checks by setting a 72-hour window for reporting new criminal activity. Lee says the move will ensure courts provide timely and accurate information to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations. The executive order will also require the state bureau to analyze the current process for sharing information during the gun-buying process so changes can be made if necessary, Lee said. Some context: The debate on gun reform was at the heart of Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson's expulsions last week. The two legislators, along with Rep. Gloria Johnson — who was not expelled — staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn in the wake of a recent mass school shooting in Nashville.  All three were accused by Republicans of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives."" Editor’s Note: Tennessee Rep. Justin J. Pearson is a Democrat and former community activist in Memphis. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Republicans who instigated my removal from the Tennessee House last week, along with and that of my legislative colleague Rep. Justin Jones, apparently failed to anticipate the nationwide backlash that their actions would engender. Democracy prevailed and the rule of law has won. This week, I plan to retake my seat. After a vote Wednesday by the Shelby County Commission, I hope and fully expect to once again represent the beautifully diverse jurisdiction of District 86 in Memphis in Tennessee’s Assembly — as I did until Thursday of last week, when Republicans voted to remove me and Rep. Jones. The unprecedented and partisan move by the chamber’s Republican supermajority to expel me from my duly-elected position temporarily silenced the voices of my constituents and flouted their right to be represented in the House. But it failed — as it did for Rep. Jones, when he was sent back to the House on Monday following a vote by the council of his district in Metro Nashville. This should be a chastening moment for revanchist forces in Tennessee’s legislature and across the country. Over the long haul, the undemocratic machinations employed to oust us from office are destined to fail. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. Events this week demonstrated, more than ever, that this is indeed the case. The stated reason for my expulsion was that I, Rep. Jones and another Democratic colleague, Gloria Johnson, “breached decorum” by peacefully walking side by side to the well of the House Chamber to acknowledge rampant gun violence that has victimized and traumatized grieving children and families across our state and around the nation. If decorum was breached, it was by the heavy-handed Republican supermajority in the Tennessee House, which denied us the chance to speak during regular order, cut off our microphones, later disabled our voting machines and revoked our access to the building. My colleagues and I exercised our First Amendment rights and joined chants from the floor during a recess hastily called by House Speaker Cameron Sexton in a further attempt to silence us and our constituents. We followed the directive of Article 2, Section 26 of the State Constitution to oppose policies injurious to the people who elected us. As a result, we were put on display in that very House to “stand trial” for our alleged offenses. The spectacle was a gross miscalculation by Republicans in the chamber. It turns out that most Americans care deeply about democracy. Most people care about equality and progress. And over two-thirds of Americans — including four out of 10 Republicans — support the kind of common sense gun safety laws that Rep. Jones, Rep. Johnson and I were protesting in favor of, in the wake of the senseless March 27 Covenant School massacre. And yet, calls for common sense gun reform measures fall on deaf ears in our legislature where a Republican supermajority is wildly out of step with most people’s values. Keep reading. The Tennessee House Republicans said Monday they would welcome ""any expelled member"" who is reappointed after the Nashville Metropolitan Council unanimously voted to reinstate Rep. Justin Jones.  ""Tennessee's constitution provides a pathway back from expulsion,"" they said in a statement released hours after Jones' reinstatement. ""Should any expelled member be reappointed, we will welcome them. Like everyone else, they are expected to follow the rules of the house as well as state law.""
            ""Our state endured a horrific tragedy on March 27 that will never be forgotten,"" the statement continued. ""We continue to mourn the six lives lost as we pray for healing. We remain focused on solutions that ensure every child and parent feels safe in every community across the Volunteer state.""  The expulsion of Reps. Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson from the Tennessee House was a rare move. The House has only expelled two state representatives in the last 157 years. The first expulsion, in 1980, was of a representative found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office, and the most recent came in 2016 when another member was expelled over allegations of sexual harassment. Democratic Rep. Joe Towns called the move a “nuclear option.” “You never use a sledgehammer to kill a gnat,” Towns said. “We should not go to the extreme of expelling our members for fighting for what many of the citizens want to happen, whether you agree with it or not.” The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Kathy Sinback, called the move in a statement a “targeted expulsion of two Black legislators without due process.” “It raises questions about the disparate treatment of Black representatives, while continuing the shameful legacy of disenfranchising and silencing the voices of marginalized communities and the Black lawmakers they elect,” Sinback added. Former Rep. Justin J. Pearson said he celebrated the fact that his colleague, Rep. Justin Jones, was reinstated Monday while also understanding another mass shooting had just taken place in Kentucky, not even a month after six people were gunned down in Nashville.  “It is multiple emotions — celebration and of the determination of the people who want to see justice happen with Rep. Jones being reseated and there’s also a painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like (Speaker of the House) Cameron Sexton and the Republican party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,” Pearson told CNN on Monday. Pearson and Jones were expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on Thursday after the two of them and Rep. Gloria Johnson staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. The chairman of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners has called a special meeting for Wednesday to consider reappointing Pearson to his former seat.  If reinstated, Pearson didn't directly answer if he'd break the rules of decorum again. Instead, he responded: ""Sometimes rules have to be broken for people who have been pushed to the periphery to be brought to the center of the conversation.""  “I believe that our actions were wholly justified in that even though we broke a rule of decorum, we stood up and we spoke for people who needed us to speak for them. … I believe what we did was right and it was for right,” Pearson added. The second of two Democratic lawmakers expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives could soon return to the chamber, as officials in Memphis on Wednesday weigh whether to appoint him as an interim representative. Here are key things to know about what is expected to happen today:  Today's vote: Shelby County commissioners are set to vote Wednesday on appointing Justin J. Pearson to the House District 86 seat, which the 28-year-old vacated last week when he was forced out in a two-thirds majority vote by the GOP-dominated body after he and two Democratic colleagues participated in a demonstration calling for gun reform on the chamber floor. The Shelby County Board of Commissioners will meet at 1:30 p.m. local time to take up the matter of Pearson’s vacant seat. How the process works: If Pearson's nomination passes with a simple majority, the council will need a two-thirds vote to suspend a rule that requires a cooling off period before a final confirmation vote. If that vote passes, Pearson could return to the House as soon as Thursday, when he and a certified copy of the minutes from the council meeting are expected to arrive in Nashville, where lawmakers will be in session at 9 a.m. local time.  A rally will happen nearby: A rally in support of Pearson will be unfolding about a mile away at the National Civil Rights Museum, starting at noon local time. The events that led us here: Pearson and Rep. Justin Jones, who are both Black, were expelled, though Jones was reinstated as an interim member and returned to the state House victorious Monday, following a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council. Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is White and participated in the demonstration on the floor of the House, survived the vote last week and kept her seat. Tennessee law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held, and the vote to appoint Pearson is expected to follow a similar process to Jones’ earlier this week. The lawmakers’ expulsions came as the long-simmering debate over guns in America boiled over in Tennessee following a mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead, including three 9-year-old children. Tennessee GOP governor calls for tougher gun restrictions: Meanwhile, Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday urged the state’s legislature to pass additional gun control measures. “I’m asking the General Assembly to bring forward an order of protection law. A new strong order of protection law will provide the broader population cover, safety, from those who are a danger to themselves or the population,” Lee said at a news conference, adding that he would like to pass the legislation within the current legislative session, which ends in a few weeks. The governor said specifics for the order of protection plan had yet to be determined but encouraged lawmakers from both parties to work together on the matter. CNN's Shawna Mizelle contributed reporting to this post.  ""Today was a powerful day and a testament to people power,"" reinstated Rep. Justin Jones said Monday. Jones, along with former Rep. Justin Pearson, was expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on Thursday after the two of them and fellow Democrat, Rep. Gloria Johnson, staged a demonstration on the floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. On Monday, he returned to the legislature after a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council. Tennessee law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held. Jones said being expelled and reinstated made him understand that ""we need more representatives who are willing to risk a title to be with the people, to stand with the people. We need bold leadership."" Now that he's back in office, Jones was told he can file 15 bills – as he's now technically a new member – which he said he plans to do by the end of the week. “Every one of those bills are going to have to do with common sense guns laws,"" he said. ""Every single one of those bills going to have to do with that, because that's what these young people are begging us to do."" Jones added, noting he's 27 years old: ""It’s time for a new generation of voices to step into their power here,"" describing it as a movement to transform the community and the nation with “a new vision of a multicultural democracy."" Tennessee State Rep. Gloria Johnson said racism absolutely played a factor in the removal last week of Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson.  ""If you heard the questioning of those two young men compared to my questioning, you definitely heard racially tinged questions,"" Johnson told CNN's Don Lemon on Tuesday.  Johnson staged a demonstration on the House floor with Pearson and Jones calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. Johnson, a White woman and a fellow Democrat, survived the vote in the GOP-dominated chamber while Pearson and Jones did not. Johnson said racism in the legislature is ""blatant, quite frankly,"" although her Republican colleagues have insisted race didn't play a role in the legislators' expulsions.  ""I hear racist statements, all the time,"" she said. Reps. Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson were kicked out of the legislature by their colleagues in a vote last week. A third member also up for expulsion, Rep. Gloria Johnson, survived the vote, which required two-thirds majority support in the Republican-dominated chamber. All three had been accused by Republicans of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives” after they led a gun control protest on the House floor last month without being recognized, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. In the wake of a deadly shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, which killed three 9-year-olds and three adults, Jones said he and other lawmakers were blocked from raising the issue of gun violence on the House floor, with their microphones being cut off whenever they raised the topic, according to WSMV. According to the expulsion resolutions, Jones, Pearson and Johnson “began shouting without recognition” during their protest and “proceeded to disrupt the proceedings of the House Representatives.” Video showed the trio using a bullhorn. Republican leaders in the chamber condemned the lawmakers’ actions and moved quickly to remove their committee assignments and schedule a vote for their expulsion. Jones' and Pearson's pictures and profiles had already been removed from the state’s General Assembly website, a symbol that the vacant seats needed to be filled. However, the Nashville Metropolitan Council unanimously voted Monday to reinstate Jones in the interim until an election is held. And Jones returned to his seat in the legislature hours later.

                      If you're cool, you'll donate blood. That's the message being sent in the latest American Red Cross partnership with ""Peanuts."" Everyone who donates blood by April 23 will receive a T-shirt while supplies last, featuring Snoopy as his alter ego, Joe Cool, in front of the Red Cross logo with the caption ""Be cool. Give blood.""  Though the Red Cross has previously given out T-shirts tied to other partnerships to donors, this particular shirt has gone viral on TikTok, thus becoming a hot commodity. Copies of the design are already being sold on resale websites like Etsy and eBay. The impact has been significant. TikTok users posting about their efforts to get the Snoopy shirts are also unintentionally informing viewers about the blood donation process and sparking an uptick in blood donors, too. ""POV: you donated blood to get the red cross x snoopy shirt,"" wrote user j_diddy3 in their video chronicling their experience donating blood, which has been viewed over a million times. ""The American Red Cross really popped off with this one,"" wrote user Erin Lovett, who donated blood after seeing another Tik Tok user post about the shirt.  The Red Cross began offering the shirts on April 1. In the past, the organization relied heavily on blood drives at colleges and high schools to bolster blood donation among young people -- a custom that became difficult during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Darren Irby, executive director of national brand partnerships at the American Red Cross.  As the campaign closes its second week, Irby said social media engagement has turned into action. Blood donations have risen by more than 40% compared to the week before the ""Peanuts"" partnership, he said, and there's been a jump in first-time blood donors, too. ""The Red Cross is thrilled that through this partnership we are able to introduce folks to this lifesaving act,"" he told CNN.  Last year, the Red Cross, which supplies an estimated 40% of the country's blood supply, faced the worst blood shortage in more than a decade. Because blood cannot be stored for long periods of time, having a stable blood supply is important, so it can then be used for medical procedures like surgeries, cancer treatment and transfusions after traumatic injuries. But there has also been scrutiny over rules for who can donate blood in the US. Under current guidelines, gay and bisexual men are required to abstain from sex for three months before donating blood -- a rule the American Medical Association has called discriminatory.  In January, the US Food and Drug Administration proposed a change to those guidelines, which would eliminate the three-month waiting period while focusing on more individual risk assessments. That proposal has not yet been finalized.

                      Here is some background information about affirmative action as well as a few notable court cases. Affirmative action policies focus on improving opportunities for groups of people, like women and minorities, who have been historically excluded in United States' society. The initial emphasis was on education and employment. President John F. Kennedy was the first president to use the term in an executive order.

                      Escaping police custody by swapping identities seems like a plot straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster, but police in Hong Kong are on the hunt for a suspect who did just that. A 37-year-old man who had been detained on suspicion of drug offenses is thought to have slipped out of a court room in the city on Monday after switching his wristband with a suspect in a separate case who had been granted temporary release. Hong Kong police said the escaped suspect, only identified by his surname Chan, disappeared shortly after he was denied bail by a magistrate at the West Kowloon Court. Officers believe Chan swapped his wristband with another man, surnamed Lam, who had been granted bail in an assault case, and simply walked out of court. They believe Chan offered Lam, 24, money in exchange for the wristband and have arrested Lam on a charge of misleading police. They have also arrested Chan's wife, 31, saying they suspect her of helping her husband to abscond by giving him money. The police said they are pursuing Chan on suspicion of absconding, a charge which carries a potential prison sentence of one year. Cases of absconding are rare in Hong Kong, a city of around 7 million people that is about six times the size of Washington, DC, but they are not completely unheard of. In 2018, a fugitive managed to escape police custody through loose tiles in the ceiling of a hospital bathroom, after being re-arrested following three years on the run.  Leon Li, then a Chinese passport holder, was arrested in 2015 on suspicion of possessing a fake Hong Kong identity card. He left the city after being granted bail but was rearrested three years later when he re-entered on a Dominican Republic passport.  Following his re-arrest, he convinced police to take him to hospital for abdominal pain, then disappeared through the ceiling. He was apprehended 36 hours later at an upscale hotel in the busy district of Wan Chai.

                      A Hanoi court on Wednesday sentenced a prominent Vietnamese political activist to six years in prison for conducting anti-state activities, his lawyer said, in a case that has raised international concerns over the communist country's treatment of dissidents. Nguyen Lan Thang, 48, participated in environmental and anti-China protests, voiced support for other jailed activists, and wrote blogs about Vietnam's sociopolitical issues, according to his social media accounts. The police said last year they arrested Thang on charges of ""making, storing or distributing information, materials, documents to oppose the state of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,"" without providing further details. Thang will also be placed under house arrest for two years after he serves his sentence, said his lawyer Le Van Luan after the closed-door trial session at the People's Court of Hanoi. Calls to the court went unanswered on Wednesday. Authorities have convicted at least 163 people since 2018 for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or association under ""vague or overbroad laws that criminalize protesting or criticizing the government,"" according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). ""Vietnam's authorities systematically trample on human rights by punishing brave bloggers like Nguyen Lan Thang for expressing their views about the government,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at HRW, which called for Thang's release and for charges against him to be dropped. A delegation of the European Parliament's Subcommittee of Human Rights during a visit to Hanoi last week expressed its ""great concern at the worsening human rights situation in the country."" ""The delegation called for immediate and unconditional release of all the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Vietnam, including NGO leaders, journalists and environmental activists,"" it said in a statement.

                      Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below. There have been more than 77,000 alleged war crimes registered by Ukraine, the country's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin told The Washington Post Wednesday. He said the alleged war crime incidents ""include not only murder, not only humiliation and rape, they also include the destroying of private property. They include forced deportation. They include forced detention of Ukrainians on occupied territories. They include looting on massive scale on the occupied territories and many other war crimes."" The chief prosecutor told the newspaper he has 305 alleged perpetrators ""who are notified of suspicion,"" along with 150 indictments ready and 30 convictions ""by Ukrainian courts with regard to Russian war criminals"" who committed alleged crimes on Ukrainian soil. He added that ""99-plus percent of all cases of war crimes committed against Ukrainians will be prosecuted and tried in Ukraine."" ""We are investigating war crimes in course of ongoing aggression,"" Kostin said to the Washington Post. ""We are not only investigating them, but also, we are making Russians accountable for the war crimes committed on Ukrainian soil."" According to Kostin, there are four elements contributing to the criminal accountability documented throughout the war in Ukraine: National efforts, assistance from the International Criminal Court, international coordination and the creation of a special international tribunal for the alleged ""crime of aggression.""  ""These four layers of criminal responsibility create full web of accountability on (a) criminal level for Russia and its perpetrators,"" Kostin told the Post.  Russia says its forces hit Ukrainian army reserves attempting to get into the battered city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. According to Russia's Ministry of Defense, Russian forces hit ""reserves of the enemy that tried to break into Bakhmut from the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Bohdanivka, as well as the units of the 28th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine close to Kostiantynivka."" On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials denied Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin's claim that Russian forces now control 80% of the city. Here are other headlines: Sanctions: The United Kingdom announced sanctions on a network of companies and individuals with financial links to Russian oligarch and ex-Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, as well as Alisher Usmanov. It said the move would would target those helping the pair to ""avoid the full cost"" of sanctions already imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The United States also imposed a large tranche of sanctions Wednesday on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to the war.  Beheading video responses: The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, EU spokesperson Nabila Massrali said on Wednesday. The statement is in response to two videos released on social media in the past week that appear to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. Wagner private military company leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has denied that his fighters were involved in the grisly video. Leaked documents: A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. Electronic conscription bill: A new bill allowing for the electronic delivery of military draft papers is meant to fix a chaotic process of registration and enlistment, the Kremlin said Wednesday. The bill is designed to make the process “modern, efficient and convenient for citizens,” spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Russian officials have denied suggestions that the bill lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization. Evan Gershkovich: The US continues its public push for consular access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, as the top official handling hostage negotiation committed to bringing him home from Russia. Access to Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. Military aid: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal repeated Ukraine’s requests for F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and longer-range missiles from the US directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in remarks at the top of their meeting at the Pentagon. Shmyhal also thanked the US for its continued military support during their meeting. Also, the Serbian government has denied it sold weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, after a report emerged claiming otherwise. ##Catch Up## Pentagon officials provided an unclassified briefing about the leaked classified information Wednesday afternoon for House leadership, the House Intelligence Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, according to three congressional sources familiar with the matter.   The 45-minute phone briefing was held by the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Defense and Security Ronald Moultrie, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs Rheanne Wirkkala and Under Secretary for Policy Colin Kahl.  It was the first official briefing the lawmakers received on the topic, coming a week after the Defense Department was made aware of the leaked classified documents.  Senate leadership and the relevant Senate national security committees also received a briefing from the Biden administration on the leaked classified documents, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The briefers told the House and Senate committees that the Pentagon is looking for the source of the leak and that the Biden administration is trying to ease the concerns of nervous allies, according to another source familiar with the briefings. One source declined to provide details about what was said but told CNN that members learned very little, and some left the meeting feeling like there was a lack of urgency inside the administration over the leak. All senators will receive a briefing on the leaked documents on Wednesday afternoon next week, according to a Senate Democratic aide. A classified briefing for all House members is also expected next week, possibly on Wednesday, one of the sources said.  The European Union Delegation at the United Nations said those who are committing war crimes in Ukraine must be held accountable after a video appears to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. ""The EU supports investigations on all war crimes committed in Ukraine. We will work tirelessly to ensure accountability,"" the EU said on Twitter Wednesday. Some background: A video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, which appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Russian social media accounts said the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved.  CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. A second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began.   A Russian military group fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Vladimir Putin attempted to buy weapons and equipment from an unlikely source: NATO member Turkey, according to a leaked US intelligence document that was obtained by CNN. The leaked document appears to show the lengths the Russian private military group Wagner has gone to try to further strengthen its capabilities as the war in Ukraine — in which it is playing a key role — continues on with no signs of abating. As a NATO member, Turkey is broadly considered a partner nation to the US and other nations providing direct military support to Ukraine and it has publicly expressed opposition to Russia's invasion. It is also home to a major US military base where nuclear weapons are stored and act as an obvious warning sign to deter Russian aggression against NATO members.  Evidence that Turkey has discussed selling weapons to Russian mercenary forces would likely raise serious concerns in Washington and complicate Ankara's relationship with other NATO members. Not only does the document reference intelligence about Wagner seeking to purchase weapons from Turkey, it also states that the paramilitary group planned to resume recruitment of prisoners from Russia's jails.  According to the US signals intelligence reporting cited in the document, personnel from the Wagner Group met with ""Turkish contacts"" in early February with the intent ""to purchase weapons and equipment from Turkey"" that could then be used by Wagner mercenaries who are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Wagner also planned to use the weapons and equipment from Turkey in Mali, where the group maintains a significant presence, according to the leaked document. While there is no evidence that shows that Turkey has moved forward with any arms sales to the Wagner Group, details about the February meeting — outlined in a section of the leaked document titled, ""Mali, Russia, Turkey: Vagner seeks weapons from Ankara"" — suggest US officials believe the Russian mercenary outfit has at least tested the waters.  CNN has not independently confirmed the veracity of the document, but US officials have indicated that most of the leaked tranche are authentic. A State Department spokesperson said the ""the Department of Defense and the intelligence community are actively reviewing and assessing the validity"" of the leaked documents, adding ""we are not in a position to confirm or comment on any specific information they contain."" CNN has reached out to the US National Security Council, the office of the Turkish President and Turkey's Embassy in Washington for comment on the document. Read more here. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has secured a $200 million loan from the World Bank to help rebuild the country’s energy sector. “Today we signed the agreement with World Bank VP Anna Bjerde to provide an additional $200 million to restore power system in #Ukraine,” he tweeted Wednesday, after a meeting in Washington. “We are also preparing to implement a military risk insurance project for foreign investors.”  “Grateful for the support for Ukraine’s recovery,” he added. Shmyhal said Ukraine would begin rebuilding damaged areas this year. “The funds attracted from the World Bank will be used to rebuild the power grid and heat supply systems in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Sumy and the cities of Chernihiv region,” he said, according to his office. “This winter, we have defeated Russia in the battle for light and are already preparing for the next heating season.” Access to Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was detained in Russia on suspicion of espionage, is being considered and will be worked out in due course, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. “Regarding the visit of Evan Gershkovich by representatives of the US Embassy in Moscow, we inform you that the issue is being considered and will be worked out in due time in accordance with consular practice and Russian law. The status assigned to him by the American authorities in this case does not matter,” said Zakharova in a statement published by the ministry Wednesday. Zakharova said the ""noise"" staged in the Western media around the detention of a journalist ""caught red-handed"" is ""an example of blatant hypocrisy."" ""It is kept silent that the American embassy in Moscow was notified in a timely manner about the detention of Evan Gershkovich. Our diplomats in similar cases, in violation of the bilateral consular convention, are informed either with a delay or not at all, especially in high-profile cases under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Justice and the FBI,"" she said. According to Zakharova, the calls by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials to its citizens to leave the Russian Federation are ""hypocritical,"" since it was Washington that launched ""the real hunt for Russians in the US and third countries."" “I emphasize that any attempts to put pressure on the Russian authorities and the courts, insisting on a 'special treatment' for US citizens who have broken the Russian law, are senseless and futile. It is time for Washington to learn that we will not tolerate interference in our internal affairs and will act exclusively in accordance with our national interests,"" Zakharova added. Some background: On Monday, the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich’s release. Reporting from CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States for its continued military support as he met with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Wednesday. ""Denys Shmyhal thanked the United States and the Secretary personally for their significant military support, as well as for their efforts to establish the Contact Group on Ukraine's Defense, which currently includes more than 50 countries,"" his office said in a readout of the meeting.  The pair discussed Ukraine’s further needs, with Shmyhal asking Austin to supply Ukraine with more weapons.  “Ukrainian soldiers have proven that they can master the latest equipment in a short time and use it effectively on the battlefield,” he said, according to his office. “For a quicker victory, Ukraine also needs more weapons: Air defense, heavy artillery and equipment, mortars and ammunition.” Wagner private military company founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin has called for the entire Russian society to be mobilized, saying people are ready to contribute to Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.  ""It is not only the mobilized who should be mobilized, those who go to the front, but all the society should be mobilized,” Prigozhin said in an audio posted on his Telegram channel, in reaction to Russia’s new electronic conscription bill. ""Starting from simple workers who are actually ready for this process."" “When we travel to the regions, our recruiters see that people are ready to be mobilized and understand that there is a war going on for the very existence of Russia,” he added. Unlike Prigozhin, the Russian government continues to deny it is waging a war in Ukraine, referring to the conflict as a ""special military operation."" The new bill put forward by the Kremlin, which is set to be signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, would tighten the rules for Russians drafted into the conflict to prevent them from leaving the country — as many did in droves during last year's ""partial mobilization."" The Wagner leader criticized Russian officials who fled the country with their wealth and said the whole ""system"" needs to be shaken.  ""Why don't we want to clean out this anthill that has been created over the years and which over the years has turned from a community of people who are ready to develop something in this country into a community of people who are only interested in their own well-being?"" he questioned. ""The system requires global sanitation and a reduction in the number of participants in this bureaucratic community."" Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal repeated Ukraine’s requests for F-15 and F-16 fighter jets and longer-range missiles from the US directly to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in remarks at the top of their meeting at the Pentagon. “We will win this war,” said Shmyhal in English, “but to achieve it faster and with fewer casualties, Ukraine still needs intensive military support.” Austin did not comment on the specific requests, but did commit to expanding the production of military assets in the US for Ukraine. “We will keep investing in our own defense industrial base to further ramp up production,” said Austin. Austin also thanked Ukraine for its focus on accountability for the security assistance the US has already provided. “Let me commend you for the unprecedented level of transparency that Ukraine has provided to ensure our security assistance remains in the hands of Ukraine’s defenders,” said Austin. Austin ignored a question about the effect of the leaked classified documents from the Pentagon on Ukraine. More on jets: In March, Slovakia joined fellow NATO member Poland in pledging to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The White House had said that Poland’s decision to send the fighter jets is a ""sovereign decision"" that won’t spur US President Joe Biden to send F-16 aircraft. The United States imposed a large tranche of sanctions on more than 100 people and entities around the world for their ties to Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Wednesday’s sanctions are the latest action meant to diminish Moscow’s abilities in its war in Ukraine and punish those who are supporting it, including through helping Russia to evade existing sanctions. Sanctions on Russian billionaire and associates: The latest sanctions target a wide network tied to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who is already under sanction in multiple countries, and were taken in coordination with the United Kingdom. According to the US Treasury Department, Usmanov ""is one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires"" who ""holds significant interests in the metals and mining, telecommunications, and information technology sectors.""  He is ""known to be close to multiple U.S.-designated, senior Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as Dmitry Medvedev, current Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former President and Prime Minister of Russia,"" according to a statement.   Sanctions on international companies and a bank: The US also imposed sanctions on companies based in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, which the US Treasury Department said is supporting Russia’s military industrial complex in defiance of existing sanctions.  The Treasury also sanctioned the International Investment Bank, ""a Russia-controlled financial institution"" in Budapest, as well as its Moscow-based subsidiary and several former and current executives.  ""The IIB’s presence in Budapest enables Russia to increase its intelligence presence in Europe, opens the door for the Kremlin’s malign influence activities in Central Europe and the Western Balkans, and could serve as a mechanism for corruption and illicit finance, including sanctions violations,” according to the Treasury Department.  Sanctions on organizations that target children: In addition, the US State Department is sanctioning two Russian entities ""that support Russia’s efforts to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine through the militarization and indoctrination of schoolchildren: The All Russian Children's And Youth Military Patriotic Public Movement Youth Army, and the State Budgetary Educational Institution of Additional Education of the Republic of Crimea Crimea Patriot Center,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.  According to the State Department, the so-called youth army was created by Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and is ""responsible for militarizing and propagandizing schoolchildren in occupied areas of Ukraine."" 
            The ""Crimea Patriot Center"" is ""an organization whose objective is to provide youth with a ‘military-patriotic education’ in order to prepare them for service in the Russia’s Armed Forces,"" it said.  The Serbian government has denied it sold weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, after a report emerged claiming otherwise.  ""Serbia has not and will not sell weapons to either Ukraine or Russia,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Milos Vucevic said in a statement Wednesday. ""We have rejected those allegations more than ten times, and we will do it again."" Vucevic was responding to a Reuters report that claimed a leaked Pentagon document names Serbia as having sent or is planning to send lethal aid to Ukraine.  ""Someone obviously aims to drag Serbia into that conflict, but we adhere to our policy consistently,"" Vucevic said. ""There is always the possibility that some weapons might mysteriously appear on the territory where there is a conflict, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Serbia. That is a question for the countries that do not conform to international norms or terms of business agreements,"" he added.�� More about the documents: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. The highly classified Pentagon documents have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Chiefs of Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post.  Ukrainian and Spanish defense ministers have denied claims that NATO troops are fighting against Russian armed forces in Ukraine, refuting allegations that emerged from a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents.  “It is totally false that there are NATO troops in Ukraine,” Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said Wednesday at a joint news conference in Madrid with her visiting Ukrainian counterpart.  “It’s not true that there are NATO personnel in Ukraine,” with the exception of military attachés, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said. Responding to a question about the document leak, Reznikov said it ""has a lot of data that’s not true (and) is no longer current. The beneficiary of this operation is Russia or its allies or sympathizers,"" adding that he is confident that Ukraine’s US allies will work to ""neutralize this leak and avoid this in the future.""  Ukraine has ""full confidence in our in our American allies"" in spite of the leak, he said. From Spain’s perspective, Robles said the unity of NATO and European Union allies remains strong and Russia will ""not achieve a break in that.""  Update on tanks: Robles said Spain’s first shipment of six modern battle tanks for Ukraine will leave soon via ship and should arrive in the war-torn country by the end of this month. Along with these six Leopard 2A4 tanks, Spain will also send 20 armored vehicles, she added. Spain will later send four more of the Leopard tanks ""as soon as possible,"" after they are repaired. Reznikov said Ukraine asked Spain for air defense systems, including combat jets, artillery rounds, and for training and technical advice in amphibious military operations, including undersea mine removal. The Ukrainian defense minister said he would meet with executives of Spanish arms makers on this visit. He and the Spanish defense minister were also expected to tour a military hospital in Madrid treating Ukrainian troops severely wounded in combat, including those whose limbs have been amputated.   Russian officials have denied suggestions that a bill to allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters it is meant only to ""fix the mess"" that followed September’s controversial partial mobilization order, which was beset by issues and prompted thousands of Russians to flee. But the strict new rules make it more difficult for Russian men to avoid an order should it be made, and Russians told CNN of their concerns about the plan. ""Now it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become,"" Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN.  While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to their own guidelines when calling up recruits. ""I have no illusions with regard to the assurances of authorities who insist these amendments were passed exclusively to improve the draft’s bookkeeping and have nothing to do with the second mobilization wave,"" he said. ""I don’t believe a word of this."" ""I believe the mobilization has never ended. It has begun and continues to the day,"" he added. ""You can look at this development as preparation of the state to step up mobilization. To make it possible to notify and mobilize large number of conscripts in a short period of time."" The bill passed through its third reading in the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament Tuesday, and was approved by the upper chamber, the Federation Council on Wednesday. Its final formality is to be signed into law by Russian President Vladimir Putin. CNN also spoke to Olga, a 48-year-old woman who fears her son, who is 16, will be sent to fight in the coming years, disrupting his plans for higher education. ""I feel very badly about this war. And same goes for all other wars and any deaths by force regardless of the cause,"" she said. ""I would prefer for wars to be fought only by professional military or volunteers."" “Should (the war) drag on and intensify, and if there is a real second wave of mobilization, then I think some will try to leave (Russia), of course,"" she added.

According to the ministry, Russian forces hit ""reserves of the enemy that tried to break into Bakhmut from the settlements of Chasiv Yar and Bohdanivka, as well as the units of the 28th Mechanised Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine close to Kostiantynivka."" The ministry also said Wagner private military company fighters had captured three more blocks in their attempt to seize control of the embattled city. CNN cannot independently verify these claims.  What Ukraine says: On Tuesday, Ukrainian officials denied Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin's claim that Russian forces now control 80% of the city. ""I've just been in touch with the commander of one of the brigades that are defending the city. I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut,"" Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told CNN on Tuesday. Western officials have conceded Russia had been able to make some progress in Bakhmut, but added it could be ""measured in meters."" Wagner private military company leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has denied that his fighters were involved in a grisly video that purportedly shows Ukrainian soldiers who have been beheaded. “I have watched this video. It’s bad when people’s heads are cut off, but I haven’t found anything to support that this is happening near Bakhmut and that Wagner fighters are participating in the execution,"" he said in a statement published by his company Wednesday. Prigozhin was responding to a question about a video that was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, which appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. A second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Andy Carey, Josh Pennington and Yulia Kesaieva contributed reporting to this post.  The US continues its public push for consular access to Evan Gershkovich as the top official handling hostage negotiation committed to bringing the detained Wall Street Journal reporter home from Russia.  “The Russians owe us a consular visit. We have yet to have consular access to Mr. Gershkovich,” US special envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens told “CNN This Morning.”  Asked if a prisoner swap is on the table, Carstens said that the US is committed to bringing Gershkovich and others who are wrongfully detained home and that US President Joe Biden would do “whatever it takes to get that job done” and is willing to make “hard decisions.” “The President of the United States and the Secretary are committed to bringing Evan home and Paul Whelan as well. And we're gonna find whatever it takes to get that job done. We’re not going into the specifics of the pathways of negotiation. To my mind that might decrease our chances to garner that release, but I can tell you that the President’s shown time and time again that he's committed, he's willing to make the hard decisions to find ways to bring Americans home,” he said.  Now that Gershkovich has been formally designated by the State Department as wrongfully detained, Carstens said it “by force of law obligates the United States of America to seek a wrongfully detained American’s release. And that's what we're doing right now. My office is working closely with the National Security Council at the White House to find those paths that will bring Evan home.”  More on Americans detained in Russia: Carstens said he spoke with Paul Whelan for about 15 minutes on Monday and they spoke “about Evan’s case.” “Paul’s spirits are still good. He's still remaining strong. He's still resilient. Small known fact — I mean, he sings the National Anthem every day from his prison cell, and he's ready to come home and we're going to find a way to bring him home,” he said, adding that his office does not prioritize cases and both Whelan and Gershkovich, along with the 30-40 cases currently being handled by his office are “treated equally.” Carstens noted that there have been conversations between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as well as discussions between US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy and her counterparts. “We've been pressing them for Evan’s release, we've been pressing them for consular access, and anything beyond that I'd rather not talk about. I want to maintain some of our negotiation space,” Carstens said, adding, “We’re going to find a way to bring Evan and Paul Whelan home.” The upper chamber of Russia’s parliament, the Federation Council, has voted in favor of the electronic delivery of military call-up papers, which critics say will make it more difficult for Russians to evade conscription. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Once the bill becomes law, a person will be considered notified even if they have not seen the call-up papers or email. The call-up papers will be deemed to be served once they appear on a government portal called Gosuslugi — the main online platform for state services in Russia, such as making a doctor’s appointment, requesting a passport or registering for marriage.  Previously, conscription documents in Russia had to be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer.  Those liable for military service will be banned from traveling abroad, the proposed legislation published on the government’s website said. Draft dodgers will receive a travel ban from the day when the summons is considered to have been ""handed"" to them, in accordance with the law.  People who fail to show up for a military summons without a valid reason within 20 days will face restrictions, such as being unable to register a vehicle and drive it, being unable to register an apartment, being unable to register as an individual entrepreneur or as self-employed, and be blocked from getting a loan. Paper and electronic summonses will have equal legal force, Andrey Kartapolov, head of the State Duma Committee on Defense, said to the RBC TV channel. According to Kartapolov, the introduced changes apply to all those liable for military service and not just to conscripts, he told state news agency TASS. Russia’s Defense Ministry routinely conscripts men for compulsory military service twice per year, in spring and autumn. The spring conscription this year will apply to 147,000 citizens between the ages of 18 and 27, and will take place from April 1 to July 15, according to an official document published by the government. More context: The Kremlin has consistently denied rumors of a possible second wave of mobilization in Russia. Its “partial mobilization” last year for its invasion of Ukraine resulted in a significant number of citizens fleeing Russia. Conscription involves the selection and enlistment of young men into the military, while mobilization refers to the larger-scale process of calling up reservists and other military personnel in the event of an emergency or war.   The UK has announced sanctions on a network of companies and individuals with financial links to Russian oligarch and ex-Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, as well as oligarch Alisher Usmanov. It said the move would target those helping the pair to “avoid the full cost” of sanctions already imposed in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  “We are closing the net on the Russian elite and those who try to help them hide their money for war,” UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a statement.  “There’s no place to hide. We will keep cutting them off from assets they thought were successfully hidden. Together with our international partners the UK will continue to crack down on those who are supporting the war. We won’t stop until Putin does.” Among those sanctioned are Demetris Ioannides and Christodoulos Vassiliades, whom the statement described as “two Cypriot professional enablers” of Abramovich and Usmanov. Companies which the Foreign Office said were part of Usmanov’s financial network were also sanctioned, including USM, Curzon Square and Hanley Limited, according to the statement.  Several family members of other Russian oligarchs who it said were “used as proxies to hide their assets” were also sanctioned, according to the statement.  The assets of Usmanov and Abramovich were frozen by the UK government shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  A new bill allowing for the electronic delivery of military draft papers is meant to fix a chaotic process of registration and enlistment, the Kremlin said Wednesday.  “We must be aware that we must regulate the system of military registration and conscription. According to the Constitution, conscripts must serve in the army. This is a constitutional duty of citizens. When the special military operation began, we saw that in some places we had a lot of chaos in the military registration and enlistment offices,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told press on a Wednesday conference call.  The bill is designed to “fix the mess” and make the process “modern, efficient and convenient for citizens,” he said.  Russian officials have denied suggestions that the bill lays the groundwork for a fresh wave of mobilization, after a chaotic order in September prompted scores of Russians to flee the country.  But the measure will make it harder for Russians to evade conscription. On Tuesday, the State Duma -- the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament -- voted in favor of allowing electronic delivery of military call-up papers in addition to traditional letters. The upper chamber, the Federation Council, approved the bill on Wednesday. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it officially becomes law. Putin is “aware” of the legislation and will “read the document” before signing it, Peskov added.  He also said the bill was passed through in “accordance with the procedure provided for in the State Duma,” and questions regarding the speed in which the bill passed should be addressed to Parliament. The EU has pledged to hold those responsible for war crimes in Ukraine to account, EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali said on Wednesday. “The EU reiterates its firm commitment to holding to account all perpetrators and accomplices of war crimes committed in connection with Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine,” Massrali said.  The statement is in response to two videos released on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. “If confirmed, this is yet another brutal reminder about the inhumane nature of the Russian aggression,” Maasrali said. “Killing prisoners of war is a very serious breach of the Geneva convention and demonstrates once more Russia’s complete disregard of international law, in particular, international humanitarian law.”  A video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier has sparked widespread outrage and a war crimes investigation by Ukraine's security services. Elsewhere, authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea have canceled planned Victory Day parades citing security concerns. Here are the latest headlines: Beheading video sparks war crimes investigation: The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a war crimes investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier, and President Volodymyr Zelensky called for those involved to be punished. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers,"" he said.
            Kremlin calls for video to be verified: Video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is “terrible,” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of it, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. 
            Russia speaks out on Gershkovich: Russia will not tolerate attempts by the US to “pressure” it over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday. Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The US State Department has designated him as being wrongfully detained.
            Russia cancels parades: Authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled parades and marches to celebrate Victory Day on May 9,  as well as May Day (May 1), citing security reasons. The two dates are public holidays in Russia, with May 9 marking Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. 
            Ukraine requests aid from India: Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova has requested more medicine and medical equipment from India, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. Dzhaparova also “proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies.""
            EU condemns Russia over civil society forum: The European Union strongly condemns the decision of Russian authorities to declare the activities of EU-Russia Civil Society Forum ""undesirable."" The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Tuesday had effectively shut down the Berlin-based organization which hosts intergovernmental conferences and civil society events. ##Catch Up## A Ukrainian defense ministry official has appealed for people to stop sharing video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier.  “We urge to stop the sharing of this video, as well as any similar video footage,"" said Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar.  ""Now after everyone has seen it, prosecutors and the International Court should watch it.” Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week: One purports to show the execution of a captured Ukrainian solider, and a second purports to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground. “From the first moments after the video of the execution of a Ukrainian soldier by Russian inhumans appeared, all competent Ukrainian services have been carefully studying it frame by frame in order to identify the war criminals,"" said Maliar on Telegram. “Tonight, we were doing just that together with other law enforcement agencies and special services,"" she added. Maliar also appealed to the public to refrain from guessing the identity of the soldier in the apparent execution video, saying authorities “are doing everything to identify the deceased.” The United Nations says it is “appalled by particularly gruesome videos posted on social media” -- one of which purports to show the execution of a captured Ukrainian solider, and a second which purports to show the mutilated bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground. In a short statement, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, part of the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), says the apparent executions are “not an isolated incident.” “In recent reports the Mission documented a number of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including those committed against prisoners of war. The latest incidents must also be properly investigated, and the perpetrators must be held accountable,” the statement said. On March 24, the UN said it has documented dozens of cases of summary executions of prisoners of war (POWs) carried out by both Russian and Ukrainian forces since February 2022, but admits it is far harder to get information from Russia, or territories under Russian control, than it is from Ukrainian authorities. The OHCHR said it has documented the summary execution of 15 Ukrainian POWs by Russian forces, in addition to the use of Ukrainian POWs as human shields, the death of two wounded POWs due to lack of medical care, as well as torture.  On the other side, the report says it has documented -- through open-source information, in situ visits and witness interviews -- the summary execution of at least 25 Russian POWs being held by Ukrainian forces.  Video purporting to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is “terrible,” but “first of all, we need to verify the authenticity” of it, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. “Of course, these are terrible shots. Then it may be a reason to check whether this is true or not, whether this took place and, if so, where and from which side,"" Peskov said during a regular call with journalists on Wednesday. Two videos purporting to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers have emerged on social media in the past week. Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for the perpetrators to be punished. “There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,” he said. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,” Zelensky added. Video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier is Russian propaganda and “an illegal execution by terrorists, by the occupying state,"" a Ukrainian official said Wednesday. “We are now conducting a detailed check of the content, the location, and who it is,"" Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, told national TV.  “This is another blatant fact of violation of all possible rules and norms of warfare. I am not even mentioning the Geneva Conventions and international humanitarian law,” he added. “This is a fact that the world must pay attention to -- not only with sympathy or indignation, but by working together to bring all those responsible to justice.” Yusov said the publication of the video is evidence “that such a genocidal policy, such a war crimes policy, is a state policy”. “Propaganda in Russia is centralized. There is a periodic posting of such videos of atrocities by the Russian military, we recently saw the execution of a Ukrainian soldier for the slogan ‘Glory to Ukraine,’ in general, once a month, once every few weeks, such content appears,"" he added.  “This is a deliberate state policy of the Russian Federation to cover the atrocities of its army against the Ukrainians, against Ukrainian military,” said Yusov. He said the goal of the policy is “undoubtedly an attempt to demoralize and sow panic among the Ukrainian defense and security forces, which they are failing at”. “Also, the purpose of such public atrocities, torture and executions is, in particular, to intimidate their soldiers.”    Two videos purporting to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers have emerged on social media in the past week.                                   Russia will not tolerate attempts by the US to “pressure” it over the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Wednesday, according to Russian state media outlet TASS.  Ryabkov told journalists Russia was considering allowing US diplomats consular access to Gershkovich, adding that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was in working contact with the US embassy.  “On this issue we are acting in full compliance with our laws, naturally taking into account the provisions of the consular convention and are guided by available precedent in this area,"" said Ryabkov. ""Therefore, we reject any attempts to pressure us.”  Gershkovich is facing up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The US State Department has designated him as being wrongfully detained, Next week a Moscow court will hear an appeal filed by Gershkovich's lawyers against the decision that he should be held in the notorious Lefortovo pre-detention center until May 29, according to state media outlet RIA Novosti.  Ryabkov also said that the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks could be fake and deliberately planted with the aim of misleading Russia, according to TASS. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has launched a war crimes investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier, it announced Wednesday. “Yesterday, a video was posted online of the Russian occupiers showing their beast side by brutally torturing a Ukrainian prisoner and cutting off his head,” the SBU said in a statement on Telegram. “The Security Service of Ukraine launched a pre-trial investigation into this war crime under Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine,” the SBU said. ""We will find these inhumans. If necessary, we will get them wherever they are: from under the ground or from the other side. But they will definitely be punished for their actions,"" SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk added. The video seen by CNN, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground.  It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. The video was one of two purportedly showing beheaded Ukrainian soldiers that have emerged on social media in the past week. The other may have been filmed more recently. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Russia “worse than ISIS” and said it is “absurd” that the country is currently presiding over the UN Security Council. “Russian terrorists must be kicked out of Ukraine and the UN and be held accountable for their crimes,” he said on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, tweeted: “Russian soldier is recorded enjoying cutting off head of Ukrainian war prisoner. Proving their beast nature and convincing world of RF's [Russian Federation’s] bloodthirstiness once again.” “There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said in response to a social media video that purportedly shows the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier. “We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,” he said in a video message on Wednesday. Two videos have emerged in the past week that purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. Dariia Zarivna, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement Wednesday that the videos are ""aimed at intimidation."" “It completely dehumanizes and demonstrates the essence of a terrorist country,” she said of the videos. “But it is important to understand the purpose. This is an PSYOP [psychological operation] aimed at intimidation. The target audience is not only Ukraine, but also Western societies,” she said. “It doesn't work on us, though. The Russians are afraid of this, but not us,” she added. The videos appear to be of separate events -- one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The second video was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier.  A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova has requested more medicine and medical equipment from India, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. Dzhaparova concluded a three-day visit to India on Wednesday, where she met with Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi. In a statement issued by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) following her visit, Dzhaparova also “proposed that rebuilding infrastructure in Ukraine could be an opportunity for Indian companies."" According to the MEA, she “handed over a letter from President Zelensky, addressed to Prime Minister Modi,"" but the ministry didn't provide further details about the letter. The MEA also announced that the next session of the Inter-Governmental Commission, a group focused on trade and bilateral cooperation between the two countries, will be held in India.  In contrast, the next round of Foreign Office Consultations, which focus on diplomatic ties between the two countries, will take place in Kyiv. The dates for both meetings are yet to be decided. The European Union strongly condemns the decision of Russian authorities to declare the activities of EU-Russia Civil Society Forum as ""undesirable,"" according to a statement from the European Union External Action (EEAS) on Wednesday.  The Russian Prosecutor General's Office on Tuesday had effectively shut down the Berlin-based organization which hosts intergovernmental conferences and civil society events. ""Civil society cooperation beyond borders and people-to-people contacts can only be desirable. However, under the current circumstances, we do not have any other choice than to discontinue cooperation with our partners from Russia,"" the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum said on LinkedIn as its webpage has now gone offline. This decision further intensifies the crackdown on independent civil society and media in Russia, taking place against the backdrop of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, the EEAS said in its statement. The European Union urges the Russian authorities to repeal the current legislation on the so-called “undesirable organizations” and “foreign agents”, which severely restricts the freedoms of association and opinion, the statement added. ""The European Union stands in solidarity with Russian citizens who are prevented from exercising their human rights. We will continue to support the important work of Russian civil society organizations, human rights defenders and independent media and journalists inside and outside Russia,"" it added. Authorities in Russian-annexed Crimea and the city of Sevastopol have cancelled parades and marches to celebrate Victory Day on May 9 and May Day (May 1) citing security reasons. The two dates are public holidays in Russia, with May 9 marking Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.   ""The authorities of the Republic of Crimea and the city-hero of Sevastopol made a joint decision not to hold festive demonstrations on May 1, the ‘Immortal Regiment’ marches and the military parade on May 9. This decision is due to security reasons,"" the Russian-appointed Head of Crimea Sergey Aksenov said on Telegram. ""Despite the cancellation of festive events, our veterans will not be left without attention,"" he added.  Aksenov noted that representatives of local authorities will visit veterans and congratulate them on Victory Day. The situation in Crimea: While any Ukrainian offensive to reclaim Crimea is at best distant, the Russians are taking no chances.  As CNN reported last month, Russia is going to great lengths to fortify the peninsula, which it illegally annexed in 2014.  The Ukrainian military, meanwhile, has been carrying out attacks in Crimea with two goals: harass the Russian Black Sea fleet and disrupt vital Russian supply lines. Few details emerge about Ukrainian strikes in Crimea. Only occasionally does unofficial social media video provide clues about what has been hit. And only occasionally do normally circumspect Ukrainian officials refer to any actions in Crimea. Previous reporting  from CNN's Tim Lister Two videos have emerged on social media in the past week which purport to show beheaded Ukrainian soldiers. The videos appear to be of separate events – one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker’s identification. “(The armoured vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,” the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.”  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. Shortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: “There will be an accountability for everything.” Read more here. The highly classified leaked Pentagon documents posted to social media offer a pessimistic US view of the war's progress in Ukraine.  The documents highlight flaws in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses and predict a stalemate in the war for months to come. The documents, which appear to date from February and March, detail many of Ukraine's perceived military shortfalls as Kyiv prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  Several of the classified documents warn Ukraine's medium-range air defenses to protect front-line troops will be ""completely reduced by May 23,"" suggesting Russia could soon have aerial superiority and Ukraine could lose the ability to amass ground forces in a counteroffensive.  The documents also underscore lingering problems with Russia's own military offensive, predicting that the result will be a stalemate between the two sides for the foreseeable future. Officials familiar with the situation tell CNN the documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing deck prepared for the Pentagon's senior leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.  The leaking of the documents — many of which are marked top secret — represents a major national security breach, and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security.  In addition to the assessment of the Ukraine war, the documents include intelligence gathered on allies and adversaries alike. Here are the latest headlines:  UN says nearly 8,500 civilian deaths confirmed in Ukraine since invasion: The  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine. between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration. 
            Ukraine's top national security official downplays leaked intelligence documents: Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to Oleksii Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council. ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod, of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov.
            Americans detained by Russia: Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with the parents of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal correspondent detained in Russia, Tuesday. It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist.
            Russia conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile: Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the Defense Ministry reports.  Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the Defense Ministry reports.  ""On April 11, 2023, a Strategic Missile Forces combat crew conducted a successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Kapustin Yar state central joint forces test range in the Astrakhan region,"" the statement said. The launch helped confirm the correctness of schematic and structural and technical solutions used in developing new strategic missile systems, the Defense Ministry said. The missile's test warhead hit the target at the Sary Shagan firing range (Republic of Kazakhstan) with the target accuracy, according to the statement.  “The objectives of the launch were fulfilled in full,"" the statement read.  Back in February, Russia carried out a test of an ICBM that appears to have failed around the time President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that ""such testing is routine."" Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s failure to grant consular access to wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich “puts it, once again, in violation of international commitments it’s made."" “I think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access, never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes, is going to do even more damage to Russia's standing around the world — a standing that has been in free-fall, particularly since its rei-nvasion of Ukraine last year,” Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. “I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there, lest they be arbitrarily detained,” he said. Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist. Blinken did say what measures are being taken to free Gershkovich, only saying that the US is “engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan’s release.”

                      How to avoid the next crisis? Banks may have to hold more cash

                      Regulators must learn ""important lessons"" from this year's banking turmoil, the world's top financial watchdog has said. Requiring banks to hold more cash to pay out depositors may be one of them.  Klaas Knot, chair of the Financial Stability Board, a body of global regulators and government officials, wrote in a letter released Wednesday that — unlike other recent shocks to financial markets — crises at US regional banks and Credit Suisse in March originated from ""within the financial system.""  ""So the need for financial authorities to learn lessons, and act upon them, is all the greater,"" Knot wrote.  External shocks that have roiled global markets in recent years include the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Speaking later on Wedneday, Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said regulators could now place stricter liquidity requirements on lenders.  In other words, banks could be told to hold more assets that can be easily converted into cash to pay back creditors in times of crisis.  Worldwide, bank holdings of liquid assets have more than doubled since 2011 to €12.5 trillion ($13.7 trillion), according to Pablo Hernández de Cos, chair of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the global standard-setter for banking regulation, who spoke alongside Bailey.  But that may still not be enough, given the ease with which bank runs can now gather pace. Bailey said the speed of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse begged the question as to ""what are appropriate and desired liquidity buffers that create the time needed to take action to solve the problem."" ""We can't assume that, going forwards, the current answer on the total size of liquidity protection is the correct one,"" Bailey said in a speech.  The central bank chief added that lenders were more vulnerable to runs on their deposits than in the past because technology allowed customers to access their accounts quickly, and communicate more easily.  Knot, who is also president of the Dutch central bank, indicated that regulators were also concerned about current ""prudential and resolution frameworks"" for banks, though he did not provide further details.  A resolution framework provides a blueprint for winding down a failing bank without destabilizing the financial system or exposing taxpayers to the risk of losses.  But Karin Keller-Sutter, Switzerland's finance minister, has said that following those guidelines during the crisis at Credit Suisse last month ""would probably have triggered an international financial crisis."" ""I have come to the realization in recent weeks that a globally active, systemically important bank cannot simply be wound up according to the 'too big to fail' plan,"" Keller-Sutter told Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung. ""Legally, this would be possible. In practice, however, the economic damage would be considerable."" Still 'too big to fail'? In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, regulators swooped onto banks to impose strict capital and liquidity requirements in order to reduce the likelihood that one would fail, as well as resolution measures in case a lender did fail. Under the new rules, it was hoped that no bank could be considered ""too big to fail"" and so requiring a taxpayer-funded bailout. But, during the most recent turmoil in March, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic sidestepped some post-2008 protocols.  In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said it would guarantee all deposits held within Silicon Valley Bank, including those above $250,000 per person. That breached a legal limit set in 2010.  A few days later, Swiss authorities brokered an emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by larger rival UBS.  But Knot credited the current regulation with preventing troubles in the banking sector from creating a ""broader contagion within the financial system.""  Still, he said, ""we cannot be complacent.""

                      US inflation falls to lowest level since May 2021

                    ","
                      Prices are moving in a more palatable direction for US consumers.  Annual inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, dropped in March for the ninth consecutive month. And for the first time since September 2020, grocery prices fell on a monthly basis. Prices rose 5% for the 12 months ended in March, down from 6% in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. Annual CPI plunged to its lowest rate since May 2021, helped by year-over-year comparisons to a period when food and energy prices spiked amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Still, CPI showed some cooling on a monthly basis. The index, which measures price changes over time for a basket of goods, ticked up 0.1% from February, as compared to a previous 0.4% increase.  Shelter costs, which tend to reflect lagging data, were the largest contributor of the monthly gain, offsetting sharp declines across energy categories, according to the BLS. The food at home index dropped 0.3% for the month, helped by lower prices for eggs (which fell nearly 11%) and fruits and vegetables (which declined 1.3%). The broader food category was unchanged (0%) for the first time since November 2020. Economists were expecting an annual increase of 5.2% and a monthly gain of 0.2%, according to Refinitiv. ""It's a good print, but it's not the end of the game, it's not the end of the story,"" Erik Lundh, principal economist at the Conference Board, told CNN. ""There's more to come — hopefully, knock on wood — and we're heading in the right direction."" Stripping out the often-volatile components of food and energy, core CPI grew 0.4% for the month, resulting in a 5.6% annual growth rate. In February, core CPI accelerated 0.5% month on month and 5.5% year over year. ""On the surface, price pressures are lessening. But when the box is opened, [core inflation] accelerated to the highest rate since May 2021,"" economist Sung Won Sohn, president of SS Economics and Loyola Marymount University professor, said in a statement. ""This is well over the 2% target set by the central bank."" He added: ""More hikes in the interest rate are coming."" CPI is one of the major inflation gauges that's being watched like a hawk by the Federal Reserve, which is in the throes of a yearlong campaign to battle inflation through monetary tightening and stark interest rate hikes.  Base effects in play The 1 percentage point drop in headline CPI is the largest downward swing seen in more than eight years; however, that feat was accomplished largely due to last year's inflation spike. ""Inflation really started to take off last spring and through June,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, told CNN. ""And so things are going to feel a lot better here in the next few months because of those base effects."" Because month-to-month changes can be volatile, even in spite of seasonal adjustments, year-over-year comparisons typically can help smooth out some of that jumpiness.  But times have been anything but typical for the past three years. So, for the months ahead, moving averages become all the more critical to observe, Lundh said.  While the picture is more clear for the trajectory of headline CPI, it's a little more opaque for core and ""supercore"" activity (core services, excluding housing), Zandi said.  The base effects are much less pronounced for core CPI, because the spring and summer inflation spike was driven by food, energy and goods prices. ""Core inflation is remaining more persistent,"" he said. ""I expect improvement really toward the middle and second half of the year when the cost of housing services really begins to slow."" Shelter costs, as measured in the CPI, tend to lag more than other categories as the BLS collects rent data every six months and most rents don't change too frequently. Private-sector data shows that apartment rents have fallen in recent months, suggesting an eventual cooldown in shelter prices will show up in the CPI. Stripping out housing, however, still leaves a ""supercore"" inflation measurement that has remained stubbornly high. ""Supercore correlates with wages; thus, the Fed would be looking at some relief in this metric as a sign of slower wage gains,"" Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, said in a statement. ""Today's report shows the supercore decelerated in March, but it remains a sticky component of inflation, running around +4% annualized on a three- and six-month basis.""   ""This is too fast and a sign that the labor market remains offsides,"" he added. More Fed rate hikes still on the horizon The March CPI trajectory doesn't take another rate hike off the table, Lundh said.  ""There was some encouraging news in the inflation data today, but I don't think it's sufficient to cause the Fed to pause,"" he said. ""So we're expecting to see a [quarter-point] hike in the May meeting and even potentially another hike following that.""  The Fed's fight grew more complex in March with the collapse of two regional US banks, which then caused turmoil in the financial industry. The Fed, the Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in to shore up depositors and prevent future bank runs. However, there are expectations that the turmoil could mean future credit tightening, which in turn could dampen demand and even help the Fed in its inflation-fighting goals. However, it could also create more uncertainty about a future recession. ""The CPI is backwards looking and the Fed still has to consider how much of a credit crunch to factor into the economy,"" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management, in a statement. While inflation has moderated since reaching a decades-high level last summer, the pace has been slower than anticipated as a strong labor labor market and resilient consumer spending has continued to fuel economic growth.

                      Corporate guidance statements will be front and center as earnings season kicks off, with investors trying to gauge the economy's temperature. Things could get chilly. Analysts forecast that first-quarter earnings for companies in the S&P 500 will fall 6.8% from the same period the previous year, according to FactSet. That would be the biggest earnings decline since profits plunged nearly 32% in the second quarter of 2020, after the onset of the Covid pandemic. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who's poised to weather it? Investors might be disappointed by what they find.

""In the last quarterly earnings, we saw a lot of really negative guidance from companies, and I don't foresee that being much different going forward."" Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the banking tumult last month raised concerns about the financial sector's health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy's precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading this week, after investors digested a jobs report that came in below expectations and awaited a slate of inflation data that could help decide the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision. Stocks rose Wednesday morning after the latest Consumer Price Index showed that annual headline inflation cooled in March for a ninth consecutive month. ""We're going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market's going up and earnings are going down,"" says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. Expected turbulence ahead The White House and other officials have called on regulators to implement tighter rules for banks to prevent future collapses. The Biden administration last month urged federal banking agencies to reverse the Trump administration's regulatory rollbacks. ""Greater regulation probably means lower margins or lower utilization of balance sheets for banks, which tends to be a bad thing for earnings growth,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede.  Investors have homed in on corporate guidance since last year to gauge companies' pricing power as sticky inflation drove up supply costs and weighed down balance sheets. However, they're particularly important this year, since banking-sector troubles have heightened fears of an economic downturn.  Big Tech stocks will also be in focus. These companies already tend to dominate earnings season due to their outsized weighting in the equities market — Microsoft and Apple have reached a whopping 13.4% combined weighting in the S&P 500, according to data from Strategas Securities. But tech earnings are especially key this time around, since behemoths in the sector have driven much of the equity market's gains this year after becoming a haven for investors during the first quarter. Shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed about 86% this year, Meta Platforms gained about 78% and Tesla surged roughly 52%. Still, earnings are just one factor driving markets, and inflation remains a key concern for the Fed. The central bank raised interest rates last month by a quarter point. Analysts largely expect the Fed to do the same at its May meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. But Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year — even after officials indicated last month that they likely won't — or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market's resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.  ""You very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,"" said Horneman.

                      Whole Foods closes San Francisco flagship store after one year, citing worker safety

                      An enormous Whole Foods in downtown San Francisco that opened just last year is temporarily closing. The company said concerns about worker safety forced it to shut down. Incidents of theft in San Francisco have gained national attention, though crime has generally fallen over the past six years. The nearly 65,000-square foot location at Trinity Place in the city's Mid-Market neighborhood shut its doors Monday to ""ensure the safety"" of its employees, a Whole Foods spokesperson said. Although Whole Foods did not share any additional information on the conditions that led to the store closing, the spokesperson added that it was a ""difficult decision to close the Trinity store for the time being."" Affected employees will be transferred to nearby stores. The store at 8th and Market streets will not open Tuesday, the spokesperson said. The store's website has also disappeared.  Heralded as a ""flagship store"" following its March 2022 opening, the Whole Foods was one of the largest supermarkets in downtown San Francisco. The store sold 3,700 local products and was designed with ""nods to classic San Francisco,"" according to a news release.  The San Francisco Standard, an independent news website, reported that this Whole Foods location had previously reduced operating hours last year because of theft and changed its bathrooms after employees found syringes and pipes.  San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Matt Dorsey said on Twitter that he was ""incredibly disappointed"" by the closure.  ""Our neighborhood waited a long time for this supermarket, but we're also well aware of problems they've experienced with drug-related retail theft, adjacent drug markets, and the many safety issues related to them,"" Dorsey wrote. Appearing on ""CNN This Morning"" Wednesday, Dorsey said he's ""seen a lot of issues of people acting out and shoplifting"" at the store.  ""Fingers crossed we can turn things around here and I do have some optimism, but hopefully we can get this supermarket back open,"" he said. Property crimes in San Francisco have garnered national attention because of several attention-grabbing videos of thieves in action. Though still well below 2017 levels, the city saw a 23% increase in property crimes between 2020 and 2022, with spikes in burglary and theft headlining the surge, according to San Francisco Police Department data. Meanwhile, violent crime statistics in San Francisco have remained relatively steady in recent years. Preliminary police data reports 12 homicides in San Francisco this year, an uptick of 20% compared to the same period in the previous year. In total, there were 56 homicides in San Francisco in 2022, which is the same number of homicides the city saw in 2021. In recent months, national retailers have been complaining about thefts affecting locations. Chains took action by locking up everyday products such as deodorant and toothpaste and added extra security guards. However, a Walgreens executive recently admitted that the impact of the thefts may have been overblown. A San Francisco Cotopaxi store temporarily closed in October 2022, citing theft and employee safety, reopening in mid-November. Cotopaxi CEO Davis Smith, in a LinkedIn post, said at the time that the ""large-scale theft and raiding"" put the store's employees at risk. But he also said he regretted that the store's closure became the subject of a political debate about crime in San Francisco and other cities. ""We had many jumping to our support, some who felt offended by my post, and a few who politicized our store's closure (because these are the times we live in, unfortunately),"" Smith wrote. ""To be clear, I never anticipated that our decision to close our Hayes Valley store would become entangled in political discourse."" This story has been updated from its original version to clarify that the company cited worker safety as a concern.

                      Elon Musk says he's cut about 80% of Twitter's staff

                      Elon Musk has laid off more than 6,000 people at Twitter since taking over the company, he told the BBC in a rare interview late Tuesday. Musk was quoted as saying in the interview that the social media platform now has only 1,500 employees, down from under 8,000 who were employed at the time of his acquisition. The reduction equates to roughly 80% of the company's staff. It's ""not fun at all"" and can sometimes be ""painful,"" the billionaire CEO told the British broadcaster at Twitter's head office in San Francisco.  The world's second richest man said that ""drastic action"" was needed when he came on board, because the company was facing ""a $3 billion negative cash flow situation."" That left Twitter with only ""four months to live,"" he estimated. ""This is not a caring [or] uncaring situation. It's like, if the whole ship sinks, then nobody's got a job,"" Musk said. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion last October.  After initially offering to take over the company in April 2022, he attempted to get out of the deal, citing concerns over how many bot accounts it had. He has since radically overhauled Twitter: firing top executives, slashing jobs and enacting new policies on how user accounts are verified or labeled. Since then, Twitter is now ""roughly"" breaking even and advertisers are returning to the platform, he told the BBC.  Musk also pledged to revise the label applied to the British broadcaster, from ""government-funded"" to ""publicly-funded"" after the BBC objected. The designation was added over the weekend. The BBC had protested the move, saying that it ""is, and always has been, independent.""  ""We are funded by the British public through the licence fee,"" it said at the time. Musk also weighed in on US scrutiny of TikTok, saying that while he was not a user of the Chinese-owned app, he was usually ""against banning things."" ""I mean, it would help Twitter, I suppose, if TikTok was banned, because then people would spend more time on Twitter and less on TikTok,"" he mused. ""But even though that would help Twitter, I would be generally against banning of things."" Musk also cracked jokes during the interview, saying that he was ""no longer the CEO of Twitter"" and had been replaced by his pet dog, a Shiba Inu named Floki.

                      Who says romance is dead? Couples are using ChatGPT to write their wedding vows

                      When Elyse Nguyen was nearing her wedding date in February and still hadn't started writing her vows, a friend suggested she try a new source of inspiration: ChatGPT.  The AI chatbot, which was released publicly in late November, can generate compelling written responses to user prompts and offers the promise of helping people get over writer's block, whether it be for an essay, an email, or an emotional speech. ""At first we inputted the prompt as a joke and the output was pretty cheesy with personal references to me and my husband,"" said Nguyen, a financial analyst at Qualcomm. ""But the essence of what vows should incorporate was there -- our promises to each other and structure."" She made edits, changed the prompts to add humor and details about her partner's interests, and added some personal touches. Nguyen ultimately ended up using a good portion of ChatGPT's suggestions and said her husband was on board with it.  ""It helped alleviate some stress because I had no prior experience with wedding vows nor did I know what should be included,"" Nguyen said. ""Plus, ChatGPT is a genius with alliteration, analogies and metaphors. Having something like, 'I promise to be your partner in life with the enthusiasm of a golfer's first hole in one' in my back pocket was comical."" Nearly five months after ChatGPT went viral and ignited a new AI arms race in Silicon Valley, more couples are looking to it for help with wedding planning, including writing vows and speeches, drafting religious marriage contracts, and setting up websites for the special day. Ellen Le recently created some of her wedding website through a new Writer's Block Assistant tool on online wedding planning service Joy, which was one of the first third-party platforms to incorporate ChatGPT's technology. (Last month, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, opened up access to the chatbot, paving the way for it to be integrated into numerous apps and services.) Le, a product manager at a startup, said she used the feature to draft an ""about us"" page and write directions from San Francisco to her Napa Valley wedding. The Writer's Block Assistant tool helps users write vows, best man and maid of honor speeches, thank you cards and wedding website ""about us"" pages. It also lets users highlight personal stories and select the style or tone before pulling it into a speech.  ""I started drafting my vows and when I typed in how we met, it produced this very delightful story,"" Le said. ""Some of it was inaccurate, making up certain details, but it gave me a helping hand and something to react to, rather than just spending 10 hours thinking about how to get started."" Le said her fiance, who often uses ChatGPT for work, is considering using AI to help with his vows too.  Joy co-founder and CEO Vishal Joshi, who studied artificial intelligence and electrical engineering at NIT Rourkela in India, said the company launched Writer's Block Assistant in March after it conducted an internal study that found most of its users were somewhat overwhelmed with getting started on writing vows and speeches, and wished they had help. He said the company has already seen thousands of submissions since launching the tool. ""Almost two decades ago, AI enthusiasts like myself and my research peers had only dreamt of mass market adoption we are seeing today, and we know this is just the true beginning,"" Joshi said. ""Just like smartphones, if applied well, the positive impact of AI on our lives can far outshine the negatives. We're working on responsibly innovating using AI to advance the wedding and event industry as a whole."" ChatGPT has sparked concerns in recent months about its potential to perpetuate biases, spread misinformation and upend certain livelihoods. Now, as it finds its way into marriage ceremonies, it could raise more nuanced questions about whether people risk losing something by injecting technology into what is supposed to be a deeply personal and, for many, spiritual moment in life. Michael Grinn, an anesthesiologist with practices in Miami and New York, was experimenting with ChatGPT when he asked it to produce a traditional Ketubah -- a Jewish marriage contract -- for his upcoming June wedding. Grinn and his fiance Kate Gardiner, the founder and CEO of a public relations firm, then requested it make some language changes around gender equality and intimacy. ""At the end, we both looked at each other and were like, we can't disagree with the result,"" he said. Editing took about an hour, but it still shaved hours off what otherwise could have been a lengthy process, he said. Still, Grinn plans to write his own vows. ""I want them to be less refined and something no one else helped me with."" He does, however, plan to use ChatGPT for inspiration for officiating his best man's wedding. ""It mostly comes down to time because I've been working so much,"" he said, ""and this is so efficient.""

                      Main Street investors bet on comeback for regional banks

                      Forget the banking crisis — Main Street's retail investors have barreled into embattled bank stocks. It looks like nothing tempts people to bet on an industry more than bargain prices, even if they're caused by the fear of imminent collapse.   In January and February, trading in First Republic Bank stock was outright sleepy. Retail investors averaged just about $20,000 in daily net purchases. After the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, however, that daily average exploded to $10.3 million, according to data through April 10 from VandaTrack. TD Ameritrade's Investment Movement Index, which tracks retail traders, found that its clients were net buyers of First Republic Bank in March even as the company's shares plummeted more than 88% over worries about uninsured deposits and the overall health of the banking system.  So far — and it's very early days — the optimism hasn't paid off: First Republic has been circling $15 a share for the last month, down from a range of $115 to $145 a share in the first two months of 2023.  PacWest Bancorp, meanwhile, another regional bank that sank in the immediate aftermath of the recent turmoil, saw post-SVB retail net purchases of its stock jump to an average of $2.9 million a day, up from virtually none in the first two months of the year. Again, buyers got bargains, paying $9 a share for a stock that had been trading around $30 in the previous few months. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, which tracks a range of mid-sized banks, saw overall net purchases grow to an average $3.9 million a day, up from net sales of $120,000 for January and February.  It's not just regional banks. Individual investors have been piling into big bank stocks like Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, data from VandaTrack showed. TD Ameritrade found that the buying interest amongst retail investors was strongest in the financial sector, which was down almost 10% during the period.  Retail investors sought out an opportunity to make ""big pay-outs on a return of confidence,"" in the banking industry, said Marco Iachini​, senior vice president of research at VandaTrack.  At the same time, he said, institutional investors, the so-called ""smart money,"" have been trading out of volatile regional bank stocks. Reddit, meanwhile, is full of posts with titles like ""First Republic Bank is easy money"" and ""Regional Banks are significantly undervalued after SVB failure."" The worry: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned last week in an interview with CNN that the banking crisis is far from over and that its consequences will likely be felt for years.  That could mean bad news for those who are betting they'll see big returns on regional bank stocks. This is a risky move for retail investors, said Iachini​, and a speculative play.  And while retail flows into bank stocks are still high, they have waned significantly since mid-March. ""That tells me retail capital isn't here to stay,"" said Iachini.  We're not seeing a meaningful recovery, at least yet, for regional bank stocks, he said. What we're seeing instead is a light version of what happened as individual investors fueled meme stocks in the early days of the pandemic.  Why Warren Buffett likes Japan's trading houses The Oracle of Omaha has set his eyes on Osaka.  In an interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei on Tuesday, billionaire investing wiz Warren Buffett said that he plans on adding to his investments in Japan.  In August 2020, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had purchased a stake of about 5% in Itochu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Marubeni. He increased his holdings of those five financial ""trading houses"" in November.  Investors abroad often shy away from investing in Japanese trading houses — they're large complex corporations involved in trading, investing, financing, and importing/exporting and often have business units all over the world. They also tend to be relatively secretive about their business operations.  But Buffett said Wednesday that he wasn't bothered by the complexity of investing in these multi-faceted entities.  ""We feel that these five companies are a cross section of not only Japan but of the world,"" he said. ""They are really so much similar to Berkshire. They own a lot of different things."" Buffett gave the rare interview in Tokyo where he plans to meet with all five companies this week ""to really just have a discussion around their businesses and emphasize our support."" This is Buffett's first trip to Japan since 2011. He added that he is looking into other Japanese companies to invest in. ""At the moment, we only own the five trading companies. There are always a few I'm thinking about,"" he said.  Shares of the five trading companies soared after Nikkei published the interview. Goolsbee preaches caution Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee addressed the ""new, big, hairy elephant in the room,"" on Tuesday. That would be the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and subsequent market turmoil. ""At moments of financial stress like this, the right monetary policy is really caution and watchfulness and prudence,"" said Goolsbee in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago. ""And I don't say that because I think we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation just because markets got upset."" But these financial woes shouldn't come before monetary policy, said Goolsbee, who is the newest Fed appointee. ""History has taught us that in moments of financial stress, even if they don't escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting monetary policy,"" he said. Minutes from the March Federal Reserve policy meeting are due out at 2 p.m. on Wednesday and the next policy decision will come in early May. Goolsbee said he'll be watching data closely for signs that credit supply is tightening.

                      Warren Buffett says geopolitical tensions were ""a consideration"" in the decision to sell most of Berkshire Hathaway's shares in global chip giant TSMC, which is based in Taiwan. The 92-year-old ""Oracle of Omaha"" shed light on the investment call in a Tuesday interview with Japanese news agency Nikkei. He was quoted as sayiing that TSMC was a well-managed company but that Berkshire had ""better places"" to deploy its capital. In February, Berkshire Hathaway revealed that it had sold 86% of its shares in TSMC, which were purchased for $4.1 billion just months before. The quick sale was considered unusual because the billionaire is known for making longer term bets. The size of the purchase suggested that the initial purchase was most likely made personally by Buffett himself, rather than one of his portfolio managers, Reuters reported. TSMC is considered a national treasure in Taiwan and supplies semiconductors to tech giants including Apple and Qualcomm. It mass produces the most advanced semiconductors in the world, components that are vital to the smooth running of everything from smartphones to washing machines. The company is perceived as being so valuable to the global economy, as well as to China — which claims Taiwan as its own territory despite having never controlled it — that it is sometimes even referred to as forming part of a ""silicon shield"" against a potential military invasion by Beijing.  TSMC's presence is seen as providing a strong incentive to the West to defend Taiwan against any attempt by China to take it by force. This week, tensions soared across the Taiwan Strait after China simulated ""joint precision strikes"" on the island during a series of military exercises.  Beijing launched the drills on Saturday, a day after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a 10-day visit to Central America and the United States where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Chinese officials described the drills as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Beijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island. Taiwan and China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago, in which the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei.

                      The five Louisiana law enforcement officers charged in the May 2019 violent arrest of Black motorist Ronald Greene pleaded not guilty at their arraignment on Tuesday.  The five defendants were all present in court with their respective attorneys, according to J. Michael Small, who is representing Kory York, one of the Louisiana State troopers involved in Greene's arrest.  York is facing a charge of negligent homicide. The charges for the three other troopers and one Union Parish deputy range from malfeasance in office to obstruction of justice, according to a copy of the indictment provided to CNN by Union Parish District Attorney John Belton.  Speaking to CNN before the hearing, Mona Hardin, Greene's mother, said, ""Justice delayed is not justice denied. Louisiana, right your wrongs!"" Greene, 49, died during the overnight hours of May 10, 2019, after police said he resisted arrest and struggled with officers. His family has said they were initially told Greene died in a car crash after a police chase.  Videos of the arrest -- released by the Associated Press and then by state police in May 2021 -- revealed graphic details of the violent struggle, showing officers kicking, punching and using a Taser on Greene before he died in their custody.  It took more than three years after Greene's death, which one Louisiana State Police member described as ""torture and murder,"" for the officers to be indicted.  The next court hearing will be held May 12, during which the sufficiency to clarify the details in the indictment will be heard, according to Small. The family has filed a wrongful-death civil lawsuit against the troopers involved in the incident and their superiors. The family is seeking damages for all medical and funeral expenses.  Troopers York and Dakota DeMoss were both shown in the arrest video, along with Trooper Chris Hollingsworth, who died in a car crash in September 2020, according to the Ouachita Parish Coroner's Office.  York initially received a 50-hour suspension for his role, according to state police. After serving his suspension, he returned to active duty pending the outcome of the review by federal and state authorities.  In May 2021, DeMoss was fired over an excessive force incident not involving Greene, according to a Louisiana state official with knowledge of the investigation.  Charles Racer, an attorney for DeMoss, told CNN he had ""no comment"" about the arraignment and referred all inquiries to the Louisiana State Police. CNN has reached out to the attorneys for the other officers charged.

                      The city of Akron, Ohio, is bracing for the findings of a special grand jury, which has been tasked with deciding if any of the eight police officers directly involved in the fatal shooting of Jayland Walker last summer will face criminal charges. The shooting -- in which Walker, who was Black, was shot dozens of times -- came after police said the 25-year-old fled an attempted traffic stop early one morning last June. Walker's death prompted an investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, along with protests over racial injustice and police use of force -- a few of which erupted into violence, resulting in damage to local businesses, according to Akron police.  Walker was unarmed at the time he was killed, according to police, though a gun was found in his vehicle after the shooting, and officers said Walker fired a gun from his vehicle during the car chase.  The Ohio BCI investigation has been completed and was referred to the special prosecutor, a spokesperson for the Ohio Attorney General's Office confirmed to CNN last month. The office declined to comment on any matters related to grand jury proceedings. The city and attorneys for Walker's family, however, acknowledged the grand jury review was underway in statements to CNN, with the latter criticizing the process as one that favored the police.  ""Today an Akron grand jury began its process of determining whether the officers who gunned down Jayland Walker last summer will be held criminally accountable for their actions,"" attorney Bobby DiCello said in a statement Monday.  ""As part of that process, as Ohio law allows, the officers will be invited to testify before the grand jury on their behalf. Keep in mind that if any other Akron citizen was accused of a crime, they would not necessarily be afforded that same privilege,"" he said. ""Simply put, it's a process that favors the officers.""  City officials hosted public meetings to address concerns about the grand jury proceedings and how any decision might impact the community. At one, Police Chief Stephen Mylett said he was ""anticipating that there is going to be a response from Akron and beyond.""  The city also has established a demonstration zone downtown, along with temporary barriers and fencing around court and municipal buildings -- moves a city spokesperson described as purely precautionary. Here's what we know about the shooting of Jayland Walker:  What police say happened Walker was killed in a burst of gunfire early June 27, 2022, following a vehicle pursuit and foot chase that started when officers tried to stop him for traffic and equipment violations.  Walker fled the stop and officers gave chase, according to a narrated video timeline police played at a news conference July 3, when police released parts of body camera videos from 13 officers at the scene. About 40 seconds after the start of the pursuit, the narrated video said, ""a sound consistent with a gunshot can be heard"" in body camera footage, and the officers told dispatch a gunshot had been fired from Walker's vehicle. Police also showed still images taken from traffic cameras that showed ""a flash of light"" -- purportedly a muzzle flash -- along the driver's side of the car.  ""That changes the whole nature"" of the incident, Mylett said at the time, turning a ""routine traffic stop"" into a ""public safety issue.""  After several minutes, Walker's vehicle slowed and he exited and ran, police said. Several police officers got out of their patrol cars and chased him, and officers deployed Tasers in an effort to stop him, police said, but were unsuccessful.  Moments later, police said, Walker ""stopped and quickly turned towards the pursuing officers."" Mylett told reporters officers believed Walker was reaching towards his waist and they ""felt that Mr. Walker had turned and was motioning and moving into a firing position,"" Mylett said, and officers opened fire, killing him.  Walker was handcuffed behind his back after the shooting -- a move Mylett said was in accordance with department policy. Mylett indicated at a community event in late March that adjustments would be made to the policy.  Walker had 46 wounds, medical examiner found Walker suffered 46 gunshot entrance or graze wounds, according to an autopsy by Summit County Medical Examiner Dr. Lisa Kohler, who found the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds.  Per Kohler, the wounds included: • 15 on Walker's torso, where he had internal injuries to his heart, lungs, liver, spleen, left kidney, intestines and multiple ribs. • 17 on his pelvis and upper legs, where the right major artery going to the leg and the bladder were injured and the pelvis and both femurs were broken. • One on his face, where the jaw broke. • Eight on his arms and right hand. • Five on his knees, right lower leg and right foot. Though police accused Walker of firing a gunshot out his vehicle's window, a gunshot residue test was not performed as part of the autopsy, Kohler said, explaining gunshot residue testing can detect specific particles related to the discharge of a firearm ""but the results of that testing is not conclusive as to whether the person did or did not fire a weapon.""  The FBI discontinued this testing in 2006, and Kohler said her office discontinued the collection of that sampling a decade later and no longer purchases collection kits. 8 officers placed on leave, then reinstated Eight police officers ""directly involved"" in the shooting were initially placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, according to department protocol, Mylett said.  They were reinstated by October 10, a decision Mylett attributed to ""staffing issues"" in comments to CNN affiliate WEWS, acknowledging ""there may be some community concern.""  While back at work, the officers were not in uniform or responding to service calls, the Akron Police Department said.  According to information released by the city, seven of the eight officers are White and one is Black.  ""The decision to deploy lethal force as well as the number of shots fired is consistent with use of force protocols and officers' training,"" the Fraternal Order of Police Akron Lodge 7 said in a statement last year.  What videos show The week following the shooting, police released 13 videos from officers' body cameras -- eight from the officers directly involved in the shooting and five others from others who were at the scene.  The videos were released according to a city ordinance requiring video footage documenting an active police officer's use of force to be released within seven days of the incident. Toward the end of the pursuit, some of the footage shows the silver car Walker was driving stopping before he begins to exit the driver's side. At least one officer shouts, ""Let me see your hands,"" and tells him not to move. The video shows Walker getting back into the car, which slowly moves forward. He is then seen getting out of the passenger side door and running from officers. At least one officer again yells for Walker to show his hands, one video shows. The foot chase continued for several seconds, before a series of gunshots ring out over seven seconds.  The videos end right after the gunshots were fired and do not depict police officers' efforts to provide medical care, though police say they attempted first aid after the shooting.  Walker was declared dead at the scene. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, CNN obtained in early September 24 more heavily redacted video clips showing more than four hours of the shooting and its immediate aftermath.  Each video contains several sections where the footage is blurred or blacked out, or where audio is muted. The city told CNN at the time this was done to redact officers' identifying information. In several videos, gunfire is heard for seven to eight seconds, followed by officers' attempts to determine whether Walker is armed while he lies face-up and non-responsive on the ground.  ""Can anyone see the gun?"" one officer is heard repeatedly asking, as a group of officers stand with guns still aimed at Walker. ""Where is the weapon at?"" one is heard asking in several videos.  Several officers are heard rendering first aid, shouting for light and asking for tourniquets and packing gauze.  None of the videos showed the inside of Walker's car, though some show officers approaching the vehicle after the shooting. ""It's got a firearm in it,"" one officer is heard saying. Police are seen in other footage trying to sequester police who fired at Walker while discussing collecting their body-worn cameras.

                      'None of us deserved it': Americans who survived kidnapping in Mexico share details of their captivity

                      More than a month after four Americans were attacked and kidnapped by a drug cartel in Mexico, the two survivors say they're still recovering from the trauma of the terrifying ordeal and the killings of their friends. ""They didn't deserve that. None of us deserved it. But we're alive -- we have a lot of recovering to do,"" LaTavia Washington McGee told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview Tuesday. Washington McGee, Eric Williams, Shaeed Woodard and Zindell Brown were kidnapped on March 3 as they were driving to a medical appointment in Matamoros, Mexico. Woodard and Brown were both killed. The attack came in broad daylight, with armed men ambushing the four friends not long after they crossed the US-Mexico border. Investigators believe the Americans were likely mistaken for Haitian drug smugglers, a US official familiar with the investigation previously told CNN.  The group was driving when they heard a car horn behind them. Brown looked back to see a gun and warned the others not to stop the car, Washington McGee recalled. Then, the shooting started. ""Zindell and Shaeed, they jumped up to run and they were gunned down,"" Williams said. As someone started to beat on the car window with a gun, Williams jumped out of the driver's side. ""That's when I was shot on both legs,"" Williams said. Washington McGee was forced into the bed of a pickup truck at gunpoint and the others were carried onto it -- a moment captured on video and shared by authorities after the kidnapping. An innocent Mexican bystander was killed during the encounter after being hit by a stray bullet almost a block and a half from where the Americans were taken, officials said. 'He said he loved us and he was gone' Williams and Washington McGee told CNN Brown and Woodward were both still alive when their limp bodies were dragged onto the truck bed. The four were then driven to another spot, where they were interrogated. ""That's where Shaeed said, 'I love y'all, and I'm gone.' And he died right there,"" Williams said. As Woodard lay dying in the back of the pickup truck, ""I told him I was sorry,"" Washington McGee recalled. ""He said he loved us and he was gone. It was the last thing he said,"" Williams said, through tears. 'Diablo masks' and guns Washington McGee and Williams said they were taken to several different locations over the days they spent in captivity, getting blindfolded as they were moved between locations. At one point, the group was taken to a house. Outside, they saw armed people in red, plastic ""Diablo"" masks who were ""pointing the guns to our head, telling us not to look up,"" Williams said. They were also taken to a clinic, where Williams described his leg being placed on a piece of wood and stitched up. ""No pain medicine or nothing. They just stitched it up,"" Williams said, adding that no one checked to see if a bullet was still inside. Washington McGee said she was put in a room with Brown, who was badly wounded and dying. ""He was fighting for his life and they didn't do nothing,"" she said. ""I talked to him the whole time ... I just told him sorry because I asked him to come with me."" ""He was like, 'It's okay. I'm your brother. I'm supposed to be there for you. I love you,'"" Washington McGee recalled. The kidnappers told them they would take Brown to a hospital, Washington McGee said, but ""they came back maybe an hour later and he was dead."" At one point, someone showed Washington McGee the video of their kidnapping. She saw herself being forced into the back of the truck. ""I just started crying. I'm like, I'm never going home"" she said. Then, there was hope. Washington McGee and Williams were woken up in a dark room to see a man standing over them with a light.  ""He was like, 'There's nothing that we can do to bring your two brothers back. But we're sorry. Somebody made the wrong call. They was high and drunk,'"" Washington McGee recalled the man saying. 'They were always a step ahead' At one point, Washington McGee and Williams were blindfolded and taken to a truck. Williams said his friends' bodies were then placed on top of him to keep him hidden. The Americans were driven around all night as they heard the sound of guns being cocked, Washington McGee said. ""They had police scanners and all types of stuff in their trucks. They knew what was going on. They were always a step ahead. So I was like, they're never gonna find us like this,"" McGee recalled. But eventually, they were dropped off at a wooden shack, where Washington McGee and Williams were rescued on March 7. The survivors and the bodies of their friends were brought back to the US. Washington McGee said she tried to escape twice during the ordeal, ""for my brothers to have the proper burial and for us to go back home to our family and kids."" An apology letter was later issued by the Gulf Cartel, which is believed to be responsible for the kidnappings, and the group handed over five of its members to local authorities, according to images circulating online and a version of the letter obtained by CNN from an official familiar with the ongoing investigation. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the photos and has asked Mexican and US authorities for comment. Though investigators believe the letter to be authentic, Mexican and US law enforcement officials participating in the investigation strongly doubt the sincerity of the group's apology, the official who shared the letter with CNN said. At least six people have been arrested in Mexico so far, according to Mexican officials.

                      A Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its shelves is set to consider shutting down its library system

                      A rural Texas county that was ordered by a federal judge to return banned books to its public library shelves is now considering shutting down its libraries entirely. A meeting of the Commissioners Court of Llano County on Thursday will include discussion of whether to ""continue or cease operations of the current physical Llano County library system pending further guidance from the Federal Courts,"" according to the meeting agenda.  The meeting comes after federal Judge Robert Pitman on March 30 ordered the Llano County Library System -- which includes three branches --  to return 12 children's books to its shelves that had been removed, many because of their LGBTQ and racial content. Books ordered to return to shelves included ""Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents"" by Isabel Wilkerson, ""They Called Themselves the K.K.K.: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group"" by Susan Campbell Bartoletti and ""Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen"" by Jazz Jennings. Seven residents had sued county officials in April 2022, claiming their First and 14th Amendment rights were violated when books deemed inappropriate by some people in the community and Republican lawmakers were removed from public libraries or access was restricted.  According to the lawsuit, the county commissioners kicked out the members of the library board in 2021 and replaced them with a new board that demanded review of the content of all its books. That led to several books being removed from its catalog access being cut off to an e-book service that included some of the disputed titles. The defendants argued the books were removed as part of a regular ""weeding"" process following the library's existing policies. The judge later gave the library system 24 hours to place the books back onto shelves, saying ""the First Amendment prohibits the removal of books from libraries based on either viewpoint or content discrimination."" The Commissioners Court agenda item for the upcoming meeting does not include a reason for the possible closure of the library. What it does say is that the discussion is ""regarding the continued employment and/or status of the Llano County Library System employees and the feasibility of the use of the library premises by the public."" ""It appears that the defendants would rather shut down the Library System entirely — depriving thousands of Llano county residents of access to books, learning resources, and meeting space — than make the banned books available to residents who want to read them,"" Ellen Leonida, the attorney for plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement to CNN. The Llano County commissioners and members of the Library Board have appealed the judge's ruling. They did not respond to CNN's request for comment.  The next hearing in the case is set for April 27 to consider possible sanctions against the defendants for failing to appear for depositions in the case. The case comes amid ongoing fights across the country to protect access to books in response to a banning boom that has taken shape in the US -- including in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries.   In 2022, the number of attempts to censor library books reached an unparalleled record high since the American Library Association began documenting data about book censorship over 20 years ago, the organization said in March. It cataloged 1,269 demands to censor library books in 2022 -- nearly double the number of challenges in 2021.

Louisville shooting The city of Louisville will hold a vigil today to let community members grieve the five people killed this week in a bank shooting. The vigil comes a day after police released dramatic police body camera footage of the shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say a 25-year-old employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The shooter's motive for the rampage remains unclear at this time as authorities continue to comb through evidence. However, officials are expected to release audio today of 911 calls that could reveal more key details, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. The mayor on Tuesday also pleaded for state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence in Kentucky, which has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. 2. Indiana fire About 2,000 people in eastern Indiana received evacuation orders Tuesday after a large fire at a recycling plant began emitting toxic smoke. The fire, which created a thick, black plume over industrial buildings and a neighborhood, is expected to burn for days -- and is ""definitely toxic,"" Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said. ""There is a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they're on fire, and it's concerning and we want to make for sure we give people heads-up on an evacuation,"" Jones said. A preliminary investigation determined the fire started in a nearby semi-trailer before spreading to the facility, an official said, adding the exact cause will likely remain unknown until after it has been extinguished.  3. Leaked documents The leaked classified Pentagon documents posted to social media suggest the US is pessimistic that Ukraine can quickly end the war against Russia. The documents highlight specific weaknesses in both Ukraine's weaponry and Russia's military offensive, predicting a stalemate for months to come. The documents also indicate some intelligence that defense officials are gathering about China, the country Washington has deemed the ""most serious long-term challenge to the international order."" Officials say the leaking of the documents -- many of which are marked top secret -- represents a major national security breach. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security. 4. Cyclone Ilsa A major cyclone is threatening to hit Western Australia with winds strong enough to lift camper vans and trampolines. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said Cyclone Ilsa is expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday, somewhere between the towns of Broome and Port Hedland. The storm is expected to generate wind gusts of more than 250 kph (155 mph) by Thursday evening, equivalent to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the US. Local authorities warned residents to tie down anything that could become airborne and urged tourists to move from the projected path of the storm. Many people have flocked to supermarkets to stock up on food and other supplies ahead of the dangerous conditions. 5. Banned books A rural Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its public library shelves is now considering shutting down its libraries entirely. A meeting in Llano County today will include a discussion of whether to ""continue or cease operations"" of the library system, which includes three branches. The meeting comes after a federal judge last month ordered the library system to return 12 children's books to its shelves that had been removed, many because of their LGBTQ and racial content. It also follows several ongoing fights across the country to protect access to books in response to a boom of book bans that has taken shape in the US -- including in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries.

                      A 25-year-old man in Kentucky legally purchased an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership. Six days later he used that weapon to kill five of his colleagues at a downtown bank, Louisville Metro Police said Tuesday. Kentucky has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. Gun enthusiasts have described it as ""one of the most gun-friendly states east of the Mississippi."" By contrast, gun violence prevention groups like Everytown have billed the state's laws as ""among the worst in the country.""  Kentucky is home to some of the highest firearm death rates in the country, the latest statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Experts attribute gun violence across the state to relaxed laws in obtaining firearms and the absence of any training requirements to handle a legally purchased gun. ""Universal background checks are nonexistent, so you can buy a gun from a stranger and there's no record of the sale, making it almost impossible for law enforcement to trace these weapons if they're ever used in a crime,"" CNN contributor Jennifer Mascia, founding staffer at The Trace, a nonprofit outlet focused exclusively on gun violence, said. ""Red flag"" laws, found in more than a dozen states across the US, allow courts to temporarily revoke firearm ownership by anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others. They too are nonexistent in Kentucky, Mascia pointed out. If the Louisville mass shooter's behavior ""had aroused suspicion among family members, it would have possibly resulted in him being disarmed or at least a visit from law enforcement, which could have derailed his plans,"" she said. Prior to 2019 -- when Kentucky allowed firearms to be carried without a concealed carry permit -- individuals had to prove they knew how to fire a gun. ""They actually had to pass a shooting test. So, you went to a shooting range and you had to make 11 out of 20 shots on a target in front of an instructor,"" Mascia said. The state eliminated the requirement when permitless carry was adopted, making anyone  eligible over the age of 21 able to lawfully possess a firearm to conceal their deadly weapon in public without officially demonstrating they know how to use it. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, there's no waiting period between the purchase of a firearm and its physical transfer to the buyer in Kentucky, whereas some states require a waiting period ranging anywhere from 72 hours to 14 days before the weapon is handed over. Gun deaths across Kentucky in 2021 were 25% greater than in 2018, the year before permitless carry was allowed in the state, Mascia, said, adding gun homicides during the same time period were up  75%, which she said bucks the idea advanced by gun proponents that the best solution to a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. While federal and state law prohibits convicted felons from gun possession, in Kentucky, domestic abusers on restraining orders, stalkers, fugitives, individuals convicted of hate crimes, and people found to be a danger to themselves or others all have legal access to guns, according to Everytown. In an emotionally charged press conference Tuesday, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, US Representative Morgan McGarvey and University of Louisville Health Chief Medical Officer Jason Smith called for city, state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence. ""The laws we have now are enabling violence and murder,"" the mayor said, and slammed a state law that requires law enforcement to put seized firearms up for auction to federally licensed firearms dealers holding a license appropriate for the type of firearm sold. Under Kentucky law, certain confiscated guns that are not retained for official use ""shall be sold at public auction,"" with partial proceeds going to public safety programs.  ""Think about that: that murder weapon will be back on the streets one day,"" Greenberg said. ""It's time to change this law and let us destroy illegal guns and destroy the guns that have been used to kill our friends and kill our neighbors."" ""We have to take action now. We need short term action to end this gun violence epidemic now, so fewer people die on our streets and in our banks in our schools,"" the mayor added. ""I don't care about finger pointing. I don't care about blame. I don't care about politics. I'm only interested in working together with our state legislators to take meaningful action to save lives to prevent more tragic injuries, and more death.""

                      The Louisville Metro Police Department has released dramatic bodycam video of officers responding to the Monday bank shooting where five people were killed and an officer fatally shot the gunman.  The bodycam video shows the tense moments between police officers and the shooter, Connor Sturgeon. It begins with video from Officer Nickolas Wilt who drives up to the scene with his training officer, identified as Cory ""CJ"" Galloway. Wilt, police say, was shot in the head as he ran toward the gunshots police were facing as they arrived. He is listed in critical condition. Wilt's camera shows him following Galloway up the outside steps to the bank, his service pistol in his two hands. The video cuts off before he is shot. Bodycam footage from Galloway, who was also shot, shows him taking fire, then retreating to a safe position behind a planter as officers talk about how they can't see the gunman and that he is shooting through windows in the front of the bank. ""Shooter has an angle on that officer!"" one officer can be heard saying. ""We got to get up there!"" he adds. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said the gunman broke out glass from the lobby windows and when he fired, officers -- who could finally pinpoint his location -- shot back.  As he looks into the bank lobby, Galloway's camera audio sounds out with several shots. ""Suspect down, get the officer!!"" one officer yells as he moves up the stairs and into the bank to investigate further. Humphrey lauded the actions of the officers. ""Officer Wilt was a brand new officer, he had no experience. He was going based on two things: his training and his character. And you will see that he never hesitates -- even after getting shot at,"" Humphrey said at a news conference where nine minutes of video was released. When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Humphrey told reporters. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is ""100% certainty"" that those swift actions saved lives. ""The actions that they took to follow up after being shot at themselves, to be compassionate and provide medical treatment, absolutely saved lives that day,"" Humphrey said Officers took Wilt to the hospital in a patrol vehicle, officials said.  Shooter recently purchased his rifle The shooter legally bought an AR-15-style rifle at a local gun dealership six days before he used it to kill five of his colleagues, the interim Louisville Metro Police chief said Tuesday. Currently, ""Kentucky imposes no waiting period between the time of purchase and the physical transfer of a firearm,"" according to the Giffords Law Center. By comparison, some states have waiting periods of 7 to 10 days. It's still not clear what provoked Sturgeon, a 25-year-old employee,  to go on a deadly rampage at Old National Bank and livestream the gruesome attack on Instagram. Sturgeon had interned at the bank for three summers and been employed there full-time for about two years, his LinkedIn profile showed. A law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that the assailant had been notified that he was going to be fired from the bank. But Louisville's mayor and police chief have since said otherwise, with interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel telling CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday that that there ""was no discussion about this individual being terminated"" before the massacre. Now, investigators are combing through the footage and other evidence to try to understand what led to the massacre that also left several wounded -- including a police officer who was shot in the head.  Officials executed a search warrant at Sturgeon's home, but Gwinn-Villaroel declined to say what was found.  The carnage marked the 146th mass shooting this year with four or more victims, not including a gunman, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  And the AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago that's reignited a fierce political fight over gun control.  What the livestream video shows It took just one minute for a gunman to complete his deadly rampage before he stopped and waited for police to arrive, according to footage of the massacre described by a city official to CNN.  The video begins by showing an AR-15-style weapon, followed by a worker in the bank saying good morning to the gunman, the official said. ""You need to get out of here,"" the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the livestream, which has been taken down by Instagram's parent company Meta. The gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can't because the safety is on and the weapon still needs to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.  The assailant then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they tried to outrun him, the official said. The shooter does not go to other populated floors of the bank, the official said. Once the shooter is done firing, he sits down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street, apparently waiting for police, the official said. The killer waits about a minute and a half before police arrive --  a swift response praised by local leaders -- and a gunfight ensues, the official said. The gunman was struck and killed. The entire incident -- from when the gunman started shooting to when he was killed -- lasted about nine minutes, Louisville Police Lt. Col. Aaron Cromwell said.  After the first bullets flew, ""There's a few minutes after that before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that when we respond to the scene,"" Cromwell said Tuesday. ""And then about three minutes after we respond, the subject is neutralized."" At one point, a Louisville police dispatcher alerted officers: ""25-year-old White male, Connor Sturgeon 6 4'. He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" according to Broadcastify audio. The timing of the dispatch wasn't immediately clear. A manager 'witnessed people being murdered' during a meeting The massacre started around 8:30 a.m., about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Staff members were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the gunman opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims told CNN. She said the massacre ""happened very quickly."" Buchheit-Sims attended the staff meeting virtually and watched in horror as gunfire exploded on her computer screen. ""I witnessed people being murdered,"" she told CNN. ""I don't know how else to say that."" Four victims died shortly after the shooting: Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, police said. A fifth victim, Deana Eckert, 57, died later Monday.  Of the nine patients hospitalized shortly after the shooting, four have been discharged and one has died. One still in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, a University of Louisville Hospital spokesperson said Tuesday.  'I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense' Before Monday's massacre, the gunman had not had ""any prior engagement"" with police, the interim chief said.   Sturgeon graduated in December 2020 from the University of Alabama, where he earned his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance, according to a university spokesperson.   After three consecutive summers interning at Old National Bank, he was hired as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.   One of Sturgeon's former high school classmates who knew the shooter and his family well said the horrific news Monday came as a ""total shock.""  ""I can't believe it,"" said the former classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense."" Victim was an 'incredible friend' and mentor One of the slain victims, bank senior vice president Tommy Elliott, was remembered by local and state leaders as a close mentor and beloved community leader.  ""Tommy was a great man. He cared about finding good people and putting them in positions to do great things. He embraced me when I was very young and interested in politics,"" said Yates, the state senator. ""He was about lifting people up, building them up.""   Elliott was also close friends with the governor and Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, who said he spent Monday morning at the hospital with Elliott's wife.  ""It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,"" Greenberg said. ""It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well."" Beshear remembered Elliott as an ""incredible friend"" and called the other slain victims ""amazing people"" who will be mourned by their loved ones.  The city is setting up a family assistance center in collaboration with the American Red Cross to provide support for those impacted, the mayor said.  ""To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,"" Greenberg said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled Tommy Elliott's last name. It has also been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.

                      The Louisville Metro Police Department released several minutes of officer body camera footage showing the tense moments between police officers and the gunman outside the Monday bank shooting. Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey walked through several clips of the incident Tuesday evening. Police said it took about three minutes for the nearest responding officers to arrive. Here's what to know: Officer Cory ""CJ"" Galloway: The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive, Humphrey said. He said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" Footage from Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds. Galloway was Wilt's training officer, according to Humphrey.
            Officer Nickolas Wilt: The newly sworn-in officer was shown in body camera footage going back into the line of fire to protect other people, Humphrey said. He said since he was new, he was acting based on ""his training and his character"" and that he ""never hesitates."" Wilt was shot in the head and is still in critical condition at the hospital, officials said. 
            What happened next: While police attempted to rescue Wilt after he was shot, Galloway's body camera shows the suspect shooting at them ""trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. This is when Galloway kills the shooter, the deputy chief said. Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound.
            Bystander video: Another video showed a recording taken by someone in a building across the street. You can see an officer outside the bank.
            Before police arrived: In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live-streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. ##Catch Up## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he is already talking with state lawmakers from both parties about gun reform, one day after a mass shooting at a bank killed five people in his city. Greenberg, who knew one person that was killed, told CNN the victims ""should not be dead,"" as in the case of other people killed by gun violence. While there is a spirit of coming together, he said, “I'm also hopeful we are taking action.” “We have had enough gun violence in Louisville. We have had enough gun violence in our country and it’s time to take action,” he said, pledging to work with other elected officials and community leaders.  Greenberg wants either statewide action in Kentucky or a change to state laws that would allow him to pass reforms in just his city. While he has had preliminary conversations with lawmakers at the state capital on both sides of the aisle, he said more meetings are expected to happen in the coming days to “talk about what we can do together” “This is not about finger-pointing. This isn’t about blame. This isn’t about politics. This is about life and death. And so right now I’m optimistic and hopeful that we can come together to make progress,” Greenberg said. Police released several minutes of officer body camera video Tuesday evening. And Greenberg said two things stood out to him about the footage — first is the bravery of the officers who ran into the building, and the second was the tragedy of watching the events unfold. “Our city is heartbroken” for those killed, the mayor said when asked how the community is reacting. Juliana Farmer, one of the five people killed in a Louisville bank on Monday, is being remembered by her family as someone who loved life. “Her siblings, they lost a sister. Her children lost a mother. Their children lost a grandmother,” Farmer's aunt, Vicki Brooks-Scott told CNN affiliate WAVE. “I lost a niece.”  Farmer, an employee at the bank, had only recently moved to Louisville from Henderson, Brooks-Scott said. “This was her third week on the job,"" she said.  “She loved life. She was a beautiful young lady,” Brooks-Scott said. “All I can say is that heaven has gained a beautiful angel.” Farmer, 45, leaves behind three children and four grandchildren, Brooks-Scott said. A fifth grandchild is expected to arrive in September, she added. “I’m hoping that this baby will be born on September 20th because that was her birthday,” she said. ##Victims## Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. LMPD Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey detailed the tense moments when police attempted to rescue Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head as police rushed to the scene of the shooting early Monday. “As they go up the stairs and attempt to rescue Officer Wilt, the suspect fires at them, trying to kill them in their process of trying to save Officer Wilt,” Humphrey said, describing bodycam video footage released Tuesday from Officer Cory ""C.J."" Galloway. Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, is in critical condition at a local hospital. He graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago. The gunfire broke the bank windows, allowing Galloway to find a vantage point to see where the gunman was located, Humphrey said. “Once he is able to see the threat, he then engages the threat, shoots and kills the suspect."" Galloway suffered a minor gunshot wound. When the shooting was over, officers and teams from other agencies reentered the bank with supplies and started providing medical treatment right away, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said. After talking to medical staff, Humphrey said it is ""100% certainty"" that those swift actions saved lives. “The actions that they took to follow up after being shot at themselves, to be compassionate and provide medical treatment, absolutely saved lives that day,"" Humphrey said. He said EMS need to ride in the back of the ambulance with the patients, but they were short-staffed, so police officers offered to drive so the EMS workers could treat a victim on the way to the hospital. ""That's what we do,"" he said. ""We improvise and we make sure that we do everything we can to keep people safe and take care of them."" The gunman in Monday's shooting appeared to be waiting for police officers to arrive at Old National Bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey.  At a Tuesday news conference, Humphrey said the shooter went to the bank's front lobby ""after assaulting the victims in the office area."" ""He could see out where no one could see in,"" Humphrey said.  Editor's note: This post contains graphic descriptions of violence. Body camera footage shows the tense moments between police officers and the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, outside the Monday bank shooting in Louisville.  Footage from Officer C. Galloway's body camera shows police talking about how they can’t see the shooter and that he is shooting through windows in the bank. “Shooter has an angle on that officer!” one officer can be heard saying. “We got to get up there!” he adds.  “Suspect down, get the officer!” one officer yells as he moves up the stairs and into the bank to investigate further. Officer Nickolas Wilt, 26, who ran toward the gunfire, was shot in the head during the incident, police previously announced.  He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting, police said. He is in critical condition at the hospital, officials tell CNN.  Body camera footage shows that Officer Nickolas Wilt went back into the line of fire to protect people, Louisville Metro Police Department Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey said during a news conference Tuesday.  Humphrey emphasized the role and mission of police is to protect lives and constitutional rights and that's what officers did during the deadly shooting at a Louisville bank Monday.   Humphrey commended Wilt's bravery. Wilt was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the bank.  ""Officer Wilt was a brand new officer, he had no experience. He was going based on two things: his training and his character. And you will see that he never hesitates — even after getting shot at — this young man went back in to the line of fire in order to protect others, and you're going to see that and how he made his decisions and how they ultimately protected other people's lives,"" Humphrey said.  ##Victims## Several minutes of police body camera video from the deadly bank shooting in Lousiville, Kentucky, shows the bravery of the responding officers, the department's Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwynn-Villaroel said. ""These officers unflinchingly answered the call to protect and their duty to serve. They confronted acts of violence head-on and neutralized the threat,"" she said at a news conference ahead of a presentation of the video. The chief said moving forward, it is time for healing and compassion, but added that officers will remain ""prepared to face and conquer"" future threats. Police previously said officers arrived at the bank three minutes after being notified of the shooting. Three officers were injured, and one had to have brain surgery, officials said. Louisville officials are releasing bodycam footage of Monday's deadly bank shooting and will show it at a news briefing happening now.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, the six to seven minutes of bodycam footage will show multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting.  In addition to the surveillance footage, CNN reported that the shooter, identified as a 25-year-old bank employee, live streamed the attack on Instagram. The video has been taken down. A city official described the footage to CNN, saying the shooter fired his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived. Earlier Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Louisville mayor told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of the shooting on Tuesday.  Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head when police confronted the gunman at the Louisville bank on Monday, is a volunteer firefighter and is active with the LaGrange Fire and Rescue Department, according to the department's chief Jim Sitzler.  He has volunteered with the department since 2016,  “He also worked for Oldham county dispatch as a dispatch and EMS,"" Sitzler told CNN, who described him as an asset to the department.  Sitzler said public service is in Wilt’s DNA.  The rookie police officer is still in critical condition after undergoing surgery, Sitzler said.  ""They have him sedated. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It’s just a wait and see,"" Sitzler said. ""Hopefully, he will recover enough where he can go to rehab."" ##Victims## Body camera footage from officers responding to the Louisville bank shooting is expected to be released Tuesday evening, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. A video package will be played and discussed at a 5 p.m. ET news conference, the mayor said.  According to the Louisville Metro Police Department, six to seven minutes of bodycam footage showing multiple angles of officers responding to the shooting will be released.  Greenberg said the video “will focus on the interactions between the shooter and police"" and that it will be “respectful” in terms of sensitivity toward victims. The video will then be uploaded to a YouTube page for distribution. 911 calls related to the incident are not expected to be released Tuesday, the police department's public information officer, Matthew Sanders told CNN.  Body camera footage showing the confrontation between police and the gunman who killed five people at a Louisville bank is expected to be released Tuesday evening.   Meantime, police are uncovering new details about the shooter. The department's chief said that the gun used in the attack was purchased less than a week ago. Here's what to know to get up to speed: Timeline: The entire incident lasted about 9 minutes, Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said. The shooting began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, according to a manager at the bank. The shooter fired his weapon for about a minute and then appeared to wait a minute and a half before police arrived, according to a city official. When officers got there, they shot and killed the gunman, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department.
            The weapon: The shooter used an AR-15-style rifle in the attack, which was purchased six days ago, police said. He bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Police also said they executed a search warrant on his house and recovered some other items. Gwinn-Villaroel would not specify what they were.
            Video of the shooting: The responding officer's body camera footage is expected to be released Tuesday evening, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Police also said the shooter live-streamed the incident on Instagram. Meta, the parent company of the platform, said that video was taken down. A city official said investigators are in possession of the video.
            Dispatcher audio: A Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. ""He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" the dispatcher said, according to Broadcastify audio.
            Victims: The five victims were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; James Tutt, 64, and Deana Eckert, 57. 
            Hospital response: Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer, said his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. He credited the Red Cross and blood donations with saving lives. On Tuesday, four patients were still at the University of Louisville Hospital, a spokesperson said. The rookie officer who was shot in the head remains sedated in the intensive care unit, Smith said.
            Calls for action: Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, and he made a plea for the state and federal governments to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city. Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political. Smith said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow ""weary.""
            Vigil planned: A local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of the shooting and unite as a community, the mayor said. ##Catch Up## A majority of adults or their family members in the United States have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Over half of US adults, 54%, have either personally or had a family member who has been impacted by such an incident, such as witnessing a shooting, being threatened by a gun, or been injured or killed by a gun. Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found. The new report came less than a day after a shooter killed five people in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured. About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily. Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot. Read more about the survey.  Louisville Metro Police Department Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell provided a few more specifics about the timeline of the fatal shooting at a bank Monday that left five dead.  During a briefing on Tuesday, Crowell said that the shooter was ""neutralized"" approximately three minutes after police responded.  ""It's about a nine-minute span from the time he begins his assault,"" Cromwell said. ""And then there's a few minutes after that, before we get the first call on it. Three minutes after that, when we respond to the scene. And then about three minutes after, we respond, the subject is neutralized.""  Crowell reiterated that the gun purchased by the shooter in the fatal bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle.  Louisville Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said it was a ""targeted"" incident, as the shooter — who was an employee of the bank — knew the victims. Police said they don’t know whether armed guards were present in the building. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg added that the shooting took place on the first floor of the bank building, and there were other people in the building at the time who were later cleared from the scene by police.  Authorities said a third officer was injured as a result of the incident, but not from a gunshot wound. CNN's Michelle Krupa contributed to this report.   The Louisville Metro Police Department has opened two separate investigations following Monday's shooting at Old National Bank — one under the purview of homicide and another under the scope of its Public Integrity Unit, a police official said. ""Because of the complexity of the scene, we had made the determination yesterday to segment the internal shooting — where between the shooter and the employees, a homicide investigation — and then the Public Integrity Unit will be the external shooting incident, which was between the suspect and the officers,"" Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said at a news conference Tuesday. ""So there's two separate investigations going. Local Metro Police will be handling the Public Integrity Unit and the homicide investigation."" How the events unfolded: The shooting began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, bank manager Rebecca Buchheit-Sims said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. The officer is sedated in the intensive care unit, Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, said at Tuesday's news conference. CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report. Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said having to treat so many victims of gun violence, day in and day out, has made him grow ""weary."" Smith said that his hospital ""barely had to adjust our operating room schedule"" on Monday because that's ""how frequent we are having to deal with gun violence in our community."" ""I'll tell you personally, I'm weary. I've been in Louisville for 15 years, all of it at University Hospital for 15 years, I've cared for victims of violence and gunshot wounds. And people say, 'I'm tired,' but I'll be honest, it's more than tired. I'm weary.""  He continued: ""There's only so many times you can walk into a room. And tell someone they're not coming home tomorrow. And it just breaks your heart. When you hear someone screaming, 'Mommy' or 'Daddy.' It just becomes too hard day in and day out to be able to do that."" Watch here: Rep. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat from Kentucky, called for Republicans to pass gun reform policies saying that the issue is not political.  ""We need policies in place that will keep this from happening again so that thoughts and prayers do not have to be offered to get another community ripped apart by the savage violence coming from guns,"" McGarvey said in a Tuesday briefing.  ""I had somebody tell me the other day. Don't make this political.  Fine. Don't make this political. People's lives aren't political. Public safety isn't political. Put those policies in place that put people first. People over guns, kids over guns, public safety over guns. Because that is what we need to address this problem,"" McGarvey added.  McGarvey discussed crisis aversion legislation that he has introduced to temporarily remove fire arms from those who are going through a crisis. He called on his colleagues to support those efforts in bipartisan way, including pushing for universal background checks.  ""We can do this. We can come together at the federal level, working with each other to solve this problem, which is impacting all of us in a uniquely American way,"" he said.  He then called out the Republicans for working harder on identify politics than on gun reform.  McGarvey said things like getting ""weapons of war off our streets"" and ""helping people who are in crisis"" are not a ""political issue,"" but ""it becomes one when Kentucky Republicans would rather ban books and pronouns and then make Kentucky a sanctuary state for weapons."" ""We are hurting. And no matter what policy we passed, no, it will not bring back these people,"" he added.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said that 40 people have now been killed by guns this year in his city, giving an impassioned plea for state and federal government to take action on gun violence or to cede that power to the city.  ""That level of gun violence is beyond horrific,"" he said in a Tuesday briefing.  ""We have to take action now. We need short-term action to end this gun violence epidemic now so fewer people die on our streets, and in our banks, and in our schools and in our churches. And for that, we need help. We need help from our friends in Frankfurt and help from our friends in Washington, DC.,"" the mayor said.   ""This isn't about partisan politics. This is about life and death. This is about preventing tragedies. You may think this will never happen to you, never happen to any of your friends or loved ones. I used to think that. The sad truth is that now no one in our city, no one in our state, no one in our country has that luxury anymore,"" he continued. As a Democratic candidate for mayor, Greenberg was the target of a shooting at his campaign headquarters. ""Last year, I survived a workplace shooting. And now yesterday, I've lost a very close friend in another workplace shooting,"" the mayor said.  Greenberg said that the state law should be changed to address Louisville's response to gun violence.  ""Let us, the people of Louisville, make our own choices about how we reduce gun violence in our city,"" he said.  The man who opened fire at a Louisville bank, killing five people, purchased the weapon he used in the attack six days ago, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said the shooter bought the weapon legally from a local dealership on April 4. ""We have executed a search warrant on his residence, and we have recovered items and we cannot get into specific details on what we recover[ed] at this time, because again the investigation is ongoing,"" she added Lt. Col. Aaron Crowell said the shooter used an AR-15 rifle in the shooting.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said a local vigil will be held Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET at the Muhammad Ali Center to honor the victims of Monday's bank shooting and unite as a community.  ""This vigil will be to acknowledge the wounds, physical and emotional, that gun violence leaves behind. It will be an interfaith opportunity for our entire community, to come together, to grieve, to heal, to begin to move forward,"" Greenberg said.    The Louisville Metro Police Department will release body-worn camera footage of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank on Tuesday afternoon, Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel announced. ""We also would like to share that later on this afternoon, we will be releasing body-worn camera footage of the incident. And so that information at the time will be released to you and the location. So everyone will be privy to that information,"" she said at a news conference Tuesday morning. Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for UofL Health, said that his hospital used 170 units of blood on Monday to treat victims from the bank shooting. Smith thanked the American Red Cross and their organization's efforts in getting the hospital additional blood needed for treatment.  He said the blood needed ""far outstrips"" the hospital's capacity and credited the Red Cross's efforts with helping to save lives. Louisville officials are holding a briefing now on Monday's fatal workplace shooting and the latest on the investigation.  The release about the briefing said officials will “provide updates on the aftermath of Monday’s shooting and announce a planned vigil.” Here's who we expect to speak at the briefing: Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg

            Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer of UofL Health An additional patient was discharged from UofL Hospital on Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. Out of the nine patients originally hospitalized:  Four have been discharged
            Four remain in the hospital
            One has died One of the four patients in the hospital is in critical condition, and the other three are in stable and fair condition, according to the hospital spokesperson. CNN reported Monday that a fifth victim had died later in the day. CNN also reported that a rookie Louisville police officer – who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago –  underwent brain surgery after being shot in the head, police said Monday.  The interim police chief told CNN Tuesday morning that the officer was still in critical condition, but stable. Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at UofL Health, later added at a news conference that the officer is sedated in the intensive care unit. James “Jim” Tutt, one of the victims of Monday's Old National Bank shooting, was a “huge fan and supporter” of the downtown Louisville area and actively helped to promote it, Rebecca Fleischaker, the executive director of the Downtown Development Corporation, told CNN.  Tutt was on the board of the Downtown Development Corporation since 2018 and recently served as treasurer, according to Fleischaker.  The nonprofit organization works on improving the Louisville downtown area by promoting redevelopment, vitality, economic growth, and a safe environment, according to their website. “Jim was very helpful to me as I started my role with Louisville Downtown Partnership last year and had an 'open-door policy' with taking any call or question,” Fleischaker said. “Jim will be deeply missed.” Tutt, who was 64 and a native of Frankfort, Kentucky, worked as the commercial real estate (CRE) market executive at Old National Bank in downtown Louisville since 2015, his LinkedIn shows. “The Louisville Downtown Partnership staff send our love and heartfelt condolences to his wife and family as well as his Old National family, for enduring what should be the unthinkable,” Fleischaker said. ##Victims## Body camera footage of the police response to the Louisville shooting will be released within the next 24 to 48 hours, according to Kevin Trager, spokesperson at the mayor’s office. He also said the footage will not be released at the upcoming 11:30 a.m. ET briefing with officials   The Louisville Metro Police Department is planning a meeting Tuesday to go over what videos might be released related to Monday's shooting at Old National Bank. The department will also discuss the process of showing the videos to the families so they can view them first before they are released to news organizations, according to a law enforcement source. Police intend to release the videos before this evening, and there could be an evening news conference, the source said. Five patients are still being treated at University of Louisville Hospital on Tuesday, with one patient upgraded from critical to fair condition, a hospital spokesperson told CNN. One of the five patients is still in critical condition, and the other four are in stable and fair condition.  Nine patients in total, including three Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers, were treated at the hospital following Monday’s shooting, the spokesperson said. Three of those patients have been discharged. Five of the nine patients sustained gunshot wounds, and one of the patients died Monday night. LMPD identified the patient who died as 57-year-old Deana Eckert. Investigators combing through Instagram video of the shooting saw firsthand the horror that unfolded Monday, watching the shooter fire his AR-15-style weapon inside the bank for about a minute and then appearing to wait a minute and a half before police arrive, according to a city official.  It’s unclear why the gunman stopped shooting.  The video shows that his attack on bank workers lasted about a minute, the official told CNN. The live stream begins with the clearly visible AR-15-style weapon before a worker inside the bank says good morning to the gunman, according to the official. “You need to get out of here,” the shooter is heard saying to the woman on the live stream, which was eventually taken down by Instagram’s parent company Meta.  According to that official, the gunman then tries to shoot her in the back but can’t because the safety is on and the weapon still needed to be loaded, the official said. Once the shooter loads the weapon properly and takes the safety off, he shoots the worker in the back, the official said. Her condition is not known.  The shooter then continues his rampage, firing at workers while they try to outrun the gunman, the official said.  The shooter does not go to other floors of the bank where workers were already present, the official said.  Once the shooter was done firing, he sat down in the lobby area that looks out onto East Main Street and appears to wait for police, the official said. The gunman waited roughly a minute and a half before police arrived and engaged the shooter in the gun battle, according to the official.    Authorities ""will make every effort"" to release body camera and surveillance footage of the bank shooting ""as soon as possible,"" Louisville Metro Police spokesperson Aaron Ellis said. “We are still in the infancy of this investigation,” he added. A spokesperson for the Louisville mayor also told CNN the office hopes to release the 911 call audio of Monday's shooting at Old National Bank later Tuesday.  The mayor has seen the surveillance footage, the spokesperson said.  “It’s clear the initial responding officers immediately engaged the shooter,” the spokesperson said, adding the officers undoubtedly saved lives and noting there were other people in the building. Separately, a Louisville Metro Police dispatcher said in an audio that the gunman, identified as Connor Sturgeon, had left a voicemail saying he was going to kill everyone at the bank. ""He's texted a friend, called a friend, left a voicemail saying he's gonna kill everyone at the bank. Feeling suicidal,"" the dispatcher said in the audio, according to Broadcastify audio. Editor’s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (or 800-273-8255) to connect with a trained counselor or visit the NSPL site. CNN's Michelle Watson contributed reporting to this post.  Old National Bank CEO Jim Ryan and other members of the bank’s leadership team are in Louisville Tuesday to provide support to individuals affected by Monday's mass shooting, according to a statement from the bank, which adds that they will continue to be there in the days ahead. “There are no words to adequately describe the sadness and devastation that our Old National family is experiencing as we grieve the tragic loss of our team members and pray for the recovery of all those who were injured,” Ryan wrote in a Monday statement to CNN. ""Obviously, this is an incredibly difficult situation, and our entire focus is on making sure that everyone affected has the support and assistance they need,"" the CEO’s statement reads. “On behalf of everyone at Old National, I also want to acknowledge and thank Louisville law enforcement, the medical community and state and local officials for their incredible response to this tragedy. And finally, we ask you to please continue to pray for all those affected.” The shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, began around 8:30 a.m. ET, police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public. Bank staff were holding their morning meeting in a conference room when the shooter opened fire, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, the bank manager, said. One bank employee frantically called her husband as she sheltered inside a locked vault, the husband, Caleb Goodlett told CNN affiiliate WLKY. By the time he called 911, police were already aware of the shooting, he said. “Just a very traumatic phone call to get,” Goodlett told the affiliate, adding that he has since seen his wife and she is OK. The gunman, who was still firing when police arrived, was killed in a shootout with officers, police officials said.  Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old rookie officer, ran toward the gunfire and was shot in the head, interim Louisville Metro Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. He had graduated from the police academy just 10 days before the shooting. Wilt underwent brain surgery and was in critical but stable condition as of Monday afternoon, the chief said. The gun used in the shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The semi-automatic rifle is the most popular sporting rifle in the US, and 30% of gun owners reported having owned an AR-15 or similar-style rifle, according to the 2021 National Firearms Survey. The AR-15 and its offshoots have been the weapon of choice in many of the most horrific mass shootings in recent memory, including the Covenant school shooting in Nashville just two weeks ago. The bank sits on the fringe of Louisville’s developing downtown business district, state Sen. Gerald Neal, who represents the district where the shooting happened, told CNN.  CNN’s John Miller, Laura Ly, Artemis Moshtaghian, Celina Tebor, Caroll Alvarado, Kristina Sgueglia, Sara Smart and Eric Levenson contributed to this report. ##Catch Up## Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg praised his community after a bank shooting Monday that left five people dead. In a CNN interview alongside Louisville Metro Police Department Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, Greenberg — who said he himself is a survivor of gun violence in the workplace — encouraged those impacted by the shooting to ""take time with loved ones."" The mayor said his friend Tommy Elliott, who was killed in the shooting, was a ""great friend"" and ""the definition of loyalty."" Elliott was also a friend to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and others around the city, he said.  He recounted having not known whether another friend had survived yesterday's attack. The mayor said when he saw his friend in the hospital, he was overwhelmed. ""We both survived,"" the mayor said he told his friend, encouraging him to see a therapist and talk to professionals. While the mayor said he doesn’t personally know the others who died, from the stories he has heard, ""they are wonderful as well."" ""We must work together to end this plague of gun violence in this country. Enough,"" he said. In an interview with CNN, Louisville's interim police chief offered few further details about the developing investigation into the fatal workplace shooting at a downtown bank in the Kentucky city, revealing that the gunman recently purchased the weapon used in the shooting without providing any more information. Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel confirmed that police searched the suspect's home Monday, adding she hopes the items that were recovered will help shed light on the motive. She did not say whether any other search warrants were executed. Asked about a note the shooter wrote indicating he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank, the interim chief said the investigation was in preliminary stages. “We will actually reveal that information, but I want to make sure that I don’t misspeak,” she continued, adding that the victims' families and the public deserve accuracy, promising more details to come.  She said that Officer Nickolas Wilt, who was shot in the head while responding to the shooting, was in critical but stable condition and “looking better.” Wilt graduated from the police academy less than two weeks ago. She asked for prayers for him and the families of others who lost their lives to “senseless” violence. Meta, the parent company of Instagram, confirmed that they took down a live-stream video of the Louisville bank shooting. ""We are in touch with law enforcement and quickly removed the live stream,"" a Meta spokesperson said.  Meta declined to comment if the video was taken down on its own or at the request of law enforcement.  Sources previously told CNN that the shooting was live streamed on Instagram and has been take down but not immediately after the shooting.   Police are in possession of the video, according to the source. The mass shooting at the Old National Bank on East Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky, began just after 8:30 a.m. — about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public, police said. It happened during a morning employee meeting, with some appearing in person and others virtually, Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN. She watched from her computer as her coworkers were gunned down. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that,” Buchheit-Sims said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.  “Just kind of a monotone personality,” she said of Sturgeon. “His temperament is pretty low key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed.” President Joe Biden spoke over the phone with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Monday evening about the bank shooting yesterday in Louisville, the White House said. He had earlier condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. At least five people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and he wrote a note that indicated that he was going to carry out a shooting at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.
            Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
            Investigation: Police did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about him. The gunman live streamed the attack on Instagram, police said. The video was subsequently taken down.
            Victims: Four of the victims who died Monday were identified as Joshua Barrick, 40; Juliana Farmer, 45; Tommy Elliott, 63; and James Tutt, 64, the chief said. Later that evening, police said a fifth victim – 57-year-old Deana Eckert – also died. Several victims remain hospitalized, including a police officer in critical condition after a shootout with the gunman.
            Reaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and state Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov. Andy Beshear said one of the victims, Tommy Elliot, was ""one of my closest friends"" and that the community will also mourn and miss all of the other victims. ##Catch Up##

                      Zelensky slams 'beasts' who purportedly beheaded Ukrainian soldiers after video emerges

                      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday condemned as ""beasts"" those who purportedly beheaded Ukrainian soldiers shown in two videos that emerged on social media in the past week. The videos appear to be of separate events -- one of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other, from the amount of foliage seen on the ground, looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video, which was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8, was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker's identification. ""(The armored vehicle) got f**ked by a mine,"" the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, ""They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.""  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war's fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video's location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the attack began. Zelensky vowed those behind the purported atrocities would be held accountable. ""There is something that no one in the world can ignore: how easily these beasts kill,"" he said in a video message. ""We are not going to forget anything. Neither are we going to forgive the murderers. There will be legal responsibility for everything. The defeat of terror is necessary,"" he said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday the video was ""terrible"" but ""first of all, we need to verify the authenticity"" of the footage.   In his regular call with journalist, Peskov said: ""Of course, these are terrible shots. Then it may be a reason to check whether this is true or not, whether this took place and, if so, where and from which side."" On Monday, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Wagner was ""reportedly continuing to commit war crimes by beheading Ukrainian servicemen in Bakhmut,"" referencing a photo shared on pro-Russian social media sites showing what appeared to be a severed head, which they claimed belonged to a Ukrainian soldier, mounted on a spike. The ISW has reported similar incidents in Popasna, in the Luhansk region, where Wagner troops were also operating earlier in the war. Some pro-Russian social media accounts have suggested Ukrainian forces were responsible for the beheadings in an effort to conceal identification. This echoes a similar claim made by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in January after his fighters apparently found bodies with severed hands and heads near Bakhmut. Dariia Zarivna, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Wednesday the videos are part of a psychological operation ""aimed at intimidation."" ""It completely dehumanizes and demonstrates the essence of a terrorist country,"" she said of the videos. ""But it is important to understand the purpose. This is an PSYOP [psychological operation] aimed at intimidation. The target audience is not only Ukraine, but also Western societies,"" she reasoned. ""It doesn't work on us, though. The Russians are afraid of this, but not us,"" she added.

                      Russians fear a second wave of mobilization, as Putin prepares to make it harder to avoid a military call-up

                      When Vladimir Putin tried to mobilize hundreds of thousands of citizens to fight in his invasion of Ukraine last September, chaos, fear and anger reverberated through Russia. For many, those feelings returned on Wednesday after the Russian parliament approved a law that made the country's conscription program more efficient, more modern -- and harder to evade. ""We have been expecting the second mobilization wave for a long time now, and this is the beginning,"" Irina, a 51-year-old psychologist whose son is of mobilization age, told CNN from Moscow. ""These amendments have already had their effect on me, by contributing to a feeling of uncertainty and anxiety."" The new bill -- passed by lawmakers on Wednesday, and awaiting only Putin's signature before it becomes law -- is, according to the Kremlin, an unremarkable streamlining of Russia's biannual conscription process. It would allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers, in addition to traditional letters, and bans those liable for military service from traveling abroad. It also includes tough penalties for those who ignore a summons -- barring them from getting a loan, moving into a new apartment, registering as self-employed and driving a vehicle. But CNN spoke to a number of Russians who dismiss the Kremlin's reassurances, and say the move lays the groundwork for another attempt to force Russians onto the battlefields in Ukraine. ""This is the second wave,"" Irina said. ""Of course, they have to feed this war with fresh meat all the time. ""During the first wave they used police raids to round up conscripts. People didn't like that. So now they are trying to concoct something different,"" she said. ""This may well be an attempt to avoid the full-scale manhunt they employed before, which caused so much panic,"" added Artem, 25, who dodged the September mobilization despite receiving a call-up. ""I am not at all convinced these measures will help to avoid a rampant mobilization like in autumn last year."" But he is certain of one thing: if another attempt at mass mobilization arrives, he will not comply. ""My relatives, not fit for army service, can drive my car if they take away my license,"" he said. ""I don't own any real estate. And the traveling ban has more of a psychological effect on me than practical -- or I would have left long ago."" He is confident his friends and family would take a similar approach. ""It will prompt them to take more measures to dodge. Some will leave, others -- move to their country homes, still others -- forge their documents,"" he said. ""Everyone will have to find some ways around this somehow. ""None of the people I know -- my friends and aquaintances will go to conscription centers,"" concurred Irina. ""They will employ anything to avoid getting there,"" she said. ""It's better to be sent to prison than be killed."" 'I don't believe a word' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that the new bill is meant only to ""fix the mess"" that followed September's controversial partial mobilization order. It was a rare admission of failure that reflected how damaging that initial effort was. The order was beset by issues, and prompted thousands of Russians to flee to the border. Asked during a regular call with reporters if the Kremlin is concerned that the impending new law would trigger another wave of mass exodus of Russians, Peskov said: ""Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with mobilization, it has to do with military registration."" ""I don't believe a word of this,"" Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN. While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to their own guidelines when calling up recruits. ""Now it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become,"" he said.  Currently, conscription documents in Russia must be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer. The new bill makes an electronic summons -- uploaded to a government portal called Gosuslugi -- equal to the traditional method, and does not take into account whether it has been read. Russia's Defense Ministry routinely conscripts men for compulsory military service twice a year, in spring and autumn. The spring conscription this year will apply to 147,000 citizens aged between 18 and 27 and will take place from April 1 to July 15, according to an official document published by the government. Officials say the changes are related to this process, which was ongoing in Russia before it invaded Ukraine last year. But the memories of September are felt intensely among young men and families around the country. ""I have no trust in today's authorities in Russia. I fear for my son even more than about my own life,"" said Alexey, whose son falls within the official age range for conscription. Is another exodus possible? The prospect of leaving Russia has been a realistic one for many who oppose the war, and who have avoided or fear a call-up.  ""Should (the war) drag on and intensify, and if there is a real second wave of mobilization, then I think some will try to leave (Russia), of course,"" said Olga, a 48-year-old woman who fears her son, who is 16, will be sent to fight in the coming years, disrupting his plans for higher education. ""I feel very badly about this war. And same goes for all other wars and any deaths by force regardless of the cause,"" she said. ""I would prefer for wars to be fought only by professional military or volunteers. But fleeing is a difficult proposition. Artem told CNN he is exploring the possibility, but sees few options and fears being unable to find work abroad. ""I do not rule out leaving Russia but I don't see how, if they impose the ban on draft dodgers traveling abroad,"" added Irina. ""I don't see a solution here."" ""And even if it were possible, finding work and accommodation abroad is not so simple. Many of those who had left in autumn last year had returned,"" she said. ""But, of course, I would feel much better had my son been living in another country. My daughter had left two years ago and I worry about her much less than I would, had she been here."" Though the Kremlin has been quick to downplay the significance of the move, its provisions and timing are convenient for a military bogged down in stalemate in its ground campaign in eastern Ukraine, after months of grinding combat which has bled their manpower and weaponry. Western officials last week told CNN they believe Russia has a problem generating ""trained military manpower.""  ""[Russia has] acknowledged that they needed 400,000 more troops and that's not just for the conflict [in Ukraine], but also to fulfill new formations which are going to be put on the new border with NATO and Finland,"" the officials said in a briefing on Wednesday, answering a question from CNN. ""How they generate that is unclear at the moment,"" the officials added, noting that a new wave of call-ups would pose risks for Moscow. ""Whether the population can sustain another round of mobilization and whether the Kremlin actually wants to test the population's resilience to that it is unclear at the moment, but the fact they haven't done would indicate to us that they have some concerns about that."" The war appears to remain generally popular in Russia -- a sentiment reinforced by relentless propaganda on state-controlled media outlets -- but analysts have noted that September's mobilization order was a turning point for many Russians, bringing the realities of conflict home to families across the country. For those who oppose the conflict, it only hardened their opposition. ""Is it the second wave? (It) seems very much so,"" Artem said. ""But any wave of mobilization is intended to supply the front with more meat."" Summing up his feelings, and referring to Putin by his first and middle names, he added: ""Try and recall all of the most eloquent obscenities you know ... that would be my view on the war, the draft and everything to do with Vladimir Vladimirovich's system of governing.""

                      Jailed Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny has been experiencing severe stomach issues in prison, and members of his team fear that he may have been poisoned again. Navalny lost eight kilograms over the past 15 days in his isolated prison cell, his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. ""The lawyer says that an ambulance was called for Alexey Navalny on the night of Friday to Saturday because of an acute stomach pain. No one is treating him and they are not even telling him the diagnosis,"" Yarmysh said. ""We do not rule out that all this time in prison he could have been poisoned with something to make his health deteriorate slowly but steadily,"" she added. Navalny's lawyer Vadim Kobzev said said that his team will request toxicological and radiological tests.  ""This may sound like nonsense and paranoia to someone else, but not to Navalny after Novichok,"" Kobzev tweeted on Tuesday. Novichok is the nerve agent which was used to poison Navalny in 2020, according to the German government, an act he and Western officials blame on the Kremlin. After recovering, just a few months later he returned to Russia where he was soon detained.    Navalny faces additional challenges in the prison, including threats from fellow inmates, according to Yarmysh and Kobzev, who appealed to the public to help fight for his release. CNN has reached out to Russia's federal penitentiary service (FSIN) for comment. Navalny is the best-known opposition politician in Russia. Even while behind bars, his Instagram and Twitter accounts keep up his attacks on Russian President Vladimir Putin as he passes notes for his team to post online. Investigative journalist Christo Grozev, who worked on CNN's ""Navalny"" documentary, said he believes Putin has ""motivation"" to poison Navalny. ""I cannot exclude that there is the motivation for that. We know that Navalny was definitely poisoned with Novichok by none other than the state of Russia. We know that he went back to Russia against the wishes of Putin,"" Grozev told CNN's Erica Hill on Tuesday. ""And, of course, now from within jail, Navalny continues to essentially ridicule Putin in the war effort by being a very vocal opponent of the war. So of course there is the motivation,"" he said.

                      On the grounds of the Al-Aqsa complex, one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism, a delicate balance that governs this holy site is under strain.     Only Muslims are allowed to pray on the sacred grounds known to them as Al Haram Al Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as Temple Mount under a status quo arrangement originally reached more than a century ago. Non-Muslim visitors are allowed visits at certain times and only to certain areas of the complex.      But many in the Muslim world fear the right to be the sole worshipers at the holy site is slowly being eroded by a growing far-right Jewish movement.    The complex lies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state and which most of the international community considers to be occupied territory. Israel captured it from Jordan in a 1967 war and considers both East and West Jerusalem as its united, ""eternal capital.""    It is the complex where Israeli police conducted violent raids twice in less than 24-hours last week. Videos shared on social media showed Israeli police beating screaming Muslim worshipers with batons. Police said they stormed the mosque itself after ""hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators barricaded themselves"" inside, throwing fireworks and stones at them.    The violence prompted rocket fire from southern Lebanon and Gaza that Israel blamed on Palestinian militants. Israel retaliated with airstrikes.   Two Muslim-born CNN journalists were given permission to report from the compound by the Jordanian custodians of the site.   The compound was relatively calm when CNN visited Tuesday. At the gates of Al-Aqsa mosque, the main mosque in the compound, a group of women recited the Quran ahead of afternoon prayers. It has been a tumultuous Ramadan and Tuesday brought more tensions.    ""I feel pain. True pain deep inside,"" Um Kamal Al-Kurdi, a Palestinian resident of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem told CNN on Tuesday morning. ""This is a house of God. It is for worship. Not for occupation or provocation. Even as we pray, we are provoked and monitored by the Israelis.""       As al-Kurdi spoke, a group of mostly Jewish visitors walked past, escorted by heavily armed Israeli police. One officer filmed the group of women as they began reciting the Quran louder and louder. A raised voice in recitation was their only form of protest in this brief but tense moment.      By Tuesday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced it would prohibit non-Muslims from entering the holy site for the rest of Ramadan. The decision isn't unprecedented, but his far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said in a statement that it was ""a serious mistake that will not bring peace, but may only escalate the situation.""     The compound consists of large open courtyards as well as the Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock.  The mosque and dome are built on top of the site where Jews believe their first and second temples stood, and is known as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism. The Western Wall is believed to be part of the second temple complex, and sits below the courtyard. It is the site that Jew face in prayer.     Most leading Rabbis say Jews should not step foot on the site. But a growing movement of Jewish extremists has been campaigning to be allowed to perform prayers on the grounds, a call that could upend the status quo arrangement that governs the management of the site. CNN witnessed at least two Jewish worshippers praying without being stopped or removed by police.      Ben Gvir is a vocal advocate of Jewish prayer at the site. Once considered the fringe of Israeli politics, having been previously convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism, his visit to the compound earlier this year drew international condemnation.    Jordan's Hashemite monarchy is the custodian of the complex, based on an agreement that dates back to 1924, and it manages the site under an Islamic trust called the Waqf. But Jordan's role is becoming increasingly symbolic, experts say, because it is Israel that controls the security checks at entry points and therefore access to the sacred grounds. Tourists can enter during visiting hours on their own, but religious Jews are often escorted by heavily armed guards.      Sheikh Azzam Khatib, the director general of the Waqf, sees these increasing visits of Jewish groups under Israeli police escort as a provocation to Palestinians and the wider Muslim word.      ""I see these visits as a raid on our holy site,"" he said. ""Israel should keep its hands off the mosque and the compound because this is a violation (of the sanctity of the site) ... and can lead to events that cannot be contained.""     The status quo itself is an unwieldly subject, fraught with debate. It is not a traditional treaty signed by the various parties during some ceremony, instead built on historical precedents dating back to the Ottoman Empire, amended and agreed upon by various bodies from the British, to the United Nations and beyond. That status quo is slowly being chipped away, says Sheikh Rani Abusibr, an Imam of nearly twenty-years at Al-Aqsa.      ""History is always written by the powerful,"" Abusibr said. ""Of course, it is expected that if there is no force to stand-up against this encroachment then our rights can easily be lost.""     Some Jewish extremist calls go beyond the demand for prayer. Far-right fringe movements want to see a third Jewish temple built at the site. On the day of CNN's visit, small groups of Jewish radicals taunted Muslims by singing ""The Temple will be built"" at the gates of the compound.      Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that he is committed to maintaining the status quo, but under his government, the most far-right in Israeli history, extremist voices are growing louder and stronger.      For the wider Arab world, al-Aqsa is seen as the last enclave of Muslim control in the heart of East Jerusalem. CNN spoke to Muslim worshippers at the site who only gave their first names citing security concerns.   ""Al-Aqsa is ours. No matter what anyone says. Al-Aqsa is ours even it was raided by a million people,"" Mohammed, a worshipper at the site, told CNN. ""It is an ideology that we carry in our minds.""      Some Palestinian worshippers must go to great lengths to reach the mosques at the complex, particularly visitors from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who generally need to obtain travel documents from Israeli authorities and can undergo lengthy waits at checkpoints and multiple security checks.      Without the status quo arrangement being enforced, there are fears that an already tumultuous region could spiral out of control. Any perceived shift in the norms can -- and has -- set-off cycles of deadly violence. But these periodic flare-ups have always fallen back on the simple understanding that has maintained some semblance of order in one of the most contentious corners of the world.      ""Of course, I don't feel safe. Everything can change in an instant, so I am always scared,"" said Noor, a worshipper inside the Dome of the Rock, the golden-domed shrine that is seen in the holy city's skyline. ""But I am here because I have faith in God.""

                      A boom in wind and solar has pushed the amount of electricity produced by renewable energy to record levels last year, according to a new analysis. The use of coal, oil and gas to produce electricity is expected to fall in 2023, according to the report, published Wednesday by energy think tank Ember. This would mark the first year to see a decline in the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity, outside of a global recession or pandemic.  Levels of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuel electricity generation may have already peaked, the report found. The findings show the world has reached the ""beginning of the end of the fossil age,"" the lead author of the research, Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, said in a statement. ""We are entering the clean power era,"" she added.  Ember analyzed data from 78 countries representing 93% of global demand for electricity, for the fourth edition of its annual Global Electricity Review. Nearly 40% of global electricity is now powered by renewables and nuclear energy, marking a new record high, according to the report.  Wind and solar made up 12% of global energy generation in 2022, up from 10% the previous year. Solar energy was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2022 for the 18th year in a row, rising by 24% compared to the previous year. Wind generation increased by 17%. Ember forecasts that in 2023, clean energy will be able to meet the total growth in electricity demand. Fossil fuels do still dominate, however. Coal power remained the single largest source of electricity across the globe, accounting for 36% of global electricity production in 2022. This is because overall demand for electricity rose, and not all of it was met from renewable sources, according to Wiatros-Motyka.  But Ember forecasts that 2022 will come to mark a ""peak"" in levels of planet-heating pollution from electricity generation, and the final year of fossil power growth.  The report predicts a small drop in fossil fuel generation of 0.3%, in 2023, with larger falls in subsequent years as wind and solar energy takes off.  ""The stage is set for wind and solar to achieve a meteoric rise to the top,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.  ""A new era of falling fossil emissions means the coal power phase down will happen, and the end of gas power growth is now within sight. Change is coming fast. However, it all depends on the actions taken now by governments, businesses and citizens to put the world on a pathway to clean power by 2040.""

                      The banking crisis could help the Federal Reserve's fight to bring down inflation, but the central bank needs to be ""cautious"" in its actions moving forward, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said Tuesday.  Goolsbee, the newest Fed appointee, spoke before the Economic Club of Chicago and addressed the ""new, big, hairy elephant in the room"" that was the recent failure of two regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and subsequent market turmoil. ""At moments of financial stress like this, the right monetary policy is really caution and watchfulness and prudence,"" he said. ""And I don't say that because I think we should stop prioritizing the fight against inflation just because markets got upset."" But instead of financial issues trumping monetary policy concerns, financial conditions should certainly be included in monetary policy discussions, Goolsbee said.  ""History has taught us that in moments of financial stress, even if they don't escalate into a crisis, they often mean tighter credit conditions and have a material impact on the real economy in a way that the Fed absolutely needs to take into account when setting monetary policy,"" he said.  Currently, he added, there's not conflict between monetary policy and potentially tightening credit conditions. They would work in tandem to cool inflation, he said.  Still, Goolsbee added, the Fed needs to be ""on watch"" for the possibility of tighter credit conditions. ""If the response to these banking problems leads the financial industry to tighten on its own, that monetary policy has to do less,"" he said. ""It's not clear yet, exactly how much less."" He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the recent turmoil equates to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three quarters of a point. ""Given how much uncertainty abounds when these financial headwinds are going, I think we need to be cautious,"" he said. ""We should gather further data and we should be extra careful about raising rates too aggressively until we see how much work the headwinds are going for us in getting inflation down."" Goolsbee said the foremost pieces of data he'll be looking for in advance of the Fed's next meeting in early May will be about how much credit tightening is occurring.

                      Leon Levine, who built Family Dollar into a discount retail giant catering to America's lower-income and middle-class shoppers, has died at 85. The Leon Levine Foundation, the philanthropic organization Levine later founded, confirmed in an online statement he died on April 5. No cause was listed. Levine, a college dropout, was one of several retail founders who ushered in a boom of stores selling low-cost goods. Discount stores have thrived in recent decades as the income gap in the United States has widened. Three dollar store chains — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar — are now the fastest-growing US retailers. Levine opened the first Family Dollar store in 1959 at age 22 in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his cousin. The store sold clothing, cleaning supplies and essentials for under $2. Family Dollar grew around the rural South and by 1969 had 50 stores. The company went public in 1970, the same year as Walmart. Levine found a niche appealing to lower-income customers in mostly rural areas. He would look for new store locations by driving around and checking supermarket parking lots. Fresh oil spots on the pavement meant the locals drove older cars and didn't have much money for repairs, the Charlotte Observer reported in 2004. Levine's Family Dollar bucked a trend in retail at the time toward building large stores in the fast-growing suburbs. Instead, the company opted for locations the size of convenience stores close to shoppers' homes. During the 1970s and 1980s, as department stores like Sears opened in malls and Walmart was beginning to build large superstores, Family Dollar built small stores in neighborhood strip malls.  Stores were typically 6,000 to 8,000 square feet and were easy for quick visits. ""We're just the opposite of a Wal-Mart,"" Family Dollar president George Mahoney told the Associated Press in 1993. ""Our customers don't want the hassle of shopping in a huge store, or they lack the funds to shop there."" By 1993, Family Dollar had 2,000 stores. A decade later, when Levine retired from Family Dollar, the company had around 4,500 stores. (Today, there are more than 8,000 Family Dollar stores. Dollar Tree bought the chain in 2015 for nearly $9 billion.) After he retired from Family Dollar, Levine became one the largest philanthropists in the South, donating hundreds of millions of dollars to universities, hospitals and Jewish organizations.

                      Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, step aside. Resale clothing shoppers are bypassing previously-owned luxury brands at discounted prices in favor of scoring secondhand mid-tier brands for less. More affordable brands, such as Madewell, Zara, Urban Outfitters, Free People, Anthropologie, Abercrombie & Fitch and Levi's are now the most popular brands with the best resale value, according to a new joint annual industry report from ThredUp, the world's largest online thrift and consignment platform, and research and analytics firm GlobalData. Re-worn clothing is a fast-growing market overall that's expected to reach $70 billion in sales by 2027, from sales of $44 billion in 2023, the report said. As many as 75% of consumers have shopped, or are open to shopping, for secondhand clothing -- and demand has only grown during the pandemic.  Among value-and-sustainability focused Gen Zers, the affinity for purchasing clothing that isn't new is particularly strong, with 83% of younger shoppers having shopped or open to buying secondhand clothing, according to the report.  James Reinhart, CEO of ThredUp, said difficult macro-economic factors, including persistent inflation in consumer goods, has helped drive more momentum in the marketplace. At the same time, he said inflation has also pushed up prices even for secondhand goods. ""Prices are up broadly just as they are everywhere else in retail,"" he said. In this environment, he said secondhand shoppers are hyper-focused on value, especially when buying clothes, and mid-tier brands are sitting in this sweetspot. Among those brands, the report showed 30% of the top 20 offer their own resale programs.  Neil Saunders, a managing director with GlobalData, said traditional retailers are responding to demand by entering the resale segment and are really the ones driving the market forward. ""We expect increased adoption in retail as secondhand becomes more of a lifestyle for consumers,"" he said. The reports said many as 88 brands launched their own dedicated resale programs last year, a 244% increase from 2021. ThredUp competitor Poshmark said mid-tier brands like Nike, Free People, Zara and J. Crew were some of the most sought-after labels in March on its platform. ""In an often luxury-filled environment, there used to be somewhat of a stigma surrounding wearing mid-tier brands, but it's now more of a flex to say your low-rise cargo pants are from J. Crew than it is to say you're wearing a Prada backpack,"" said Chloe Baffert, merchandising and curation expert at Poshmark She said affordable, mass market brands are revamping their styles and are effectively leveraging social media to show how they're staying more in tune with the latest trends.  ""It's a bragging right [for consumers] to say you're on trend and within budget,"" she said.

                      US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she believes the American economy remains strong and its banking system is resilient despite some recent turmoil among regional financial institutions.  ""I've not really seen evidence at this stage suggesting a contraction in credit, although that is a possibility,"" Yellen said at a press conference Tuesday ahead of the spring World Bank meetings. ""I believe our banking system remains strong and resilient; it has solid capital and liquidity."" She added that the ""US economy is obviously performing exceptionally well,"" noting solid job creation, moderating inflation and robust consumer spending.  ""So I'm not anticipating a downturn in the economy, although of course that remains a risk,"" she said.  The global economy remains in a better place than many have expected, she said.  ""[During the G20 meeting in February], I said that the global economy was in a better place than many predicted last fall,"" Yellen said. ""That basic picture has remained largely unchanged."" Her assessment of the global outlook appears to be rosier than that of the International Monetary Fund, which downgraded its forecast on Tuesday, citing financial market volatility. The IMF now expects economic growth to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. Its estimate in January had been for 2.9% growth this year. Last month, jitters grew in the financial sector after the collapse of two US regional banks, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and global banking giant Credit Suisse teetered on the brink of collapse before merging with rival UBS.  ""Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled,"" the organization said in its latest report. The US Treasury, in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, intervened after the regional bank failures to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs.  Yellen at the time said the ""decisive and forceful actions"" taken helped stabilize the situation and added that the ""US banking system remains sound."" Still, the emergence of stress in financial markets comes at a precarious time for central banks, according to the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report released Tuesday.  The turmoil ""complicates the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving to be more persistent than anticipated,"" according to the report. ""If financial strains intensify significantly and threaten the health of the financial system amid high inflation, trade-offs between inflation and financial stability objectives may emerge."" In the United States, the Fed is in the throes of a yearlong effort to cool down the highest inflation seen in four decades.  Inflation has moderated in recent months; however, the banking turmoil, along with broader global and domestic macroeconomic factors — including Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the lack of an agreement on the US debt limit — heighten uncertainty about future economic stability.  In January, Treasury undertook ""extraordinary measures"" that allow the US government to continue paying its bills. However, those efforts serve as a stopgap, and a default could come as early as this summer, economists and the government has estimated. Yellen has repeatedly pressed for congressional action to address the borrowing cap. In her comments Tuesday, Yellen also pledged continued economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia's invasion. ""If the war continues, we'll have to continue to work with our partners to provide the support that Ukraine needs, and we're committed to doing that,"" she said. —CNN's Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.

                      At the start of the year, economists and corporate leaders expressed optimism that global economic growth might not slow down as much as they had feared. Positive developments included China's reopening, signs of resilience in Europe and falling energy prices. But a crisis in the banking sector that emerged last month has changed the calculus. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecasts for the global economy Tuesday, noting ""the recent increase in financial market volatility."" The IMF now expects economic growth to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. Its estimate in January had been for 2.9% growth this year. ""Uncertainty is high, and the balance of risks has shifted firmly to the downside so long as the financial sector remains unsettled,"" the organization said in its latest report. Fears about the economic outlook have increased following the failures in March of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, two regional US lenders, and the loss of confidence in the much-larger Credit Suisse, which was sold to rival UBS in a government-backed rescue deal. Already, the global economy was grappling with the consequences of high and persistent inflation, the rapid rise in interest rates to fight it, elevated debt levels and Russia's war in Ukraine. Now, concerns about the health of the banking industry join the list. ""These forces are now overlaid by, and interacting with, new financial stability concerns,"" the IMF said, noting that policymakers trying to tame inflation while averting a ""hard landing,"" or a painful recession, ""may face difficult trade-offs."" Global inflation, which the IMF said was proving ""much stickier than anticipated,"" is expected to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7% this year and to 4.9% in 2024. Changing forecasts Investors are looking for additional pockets of vulnerability in the financial sector. Meanwhile, lenders may turn more conservative to preserve cash they may need to deal with an unpredictable environment. That would make it harder for businesses and households to access loans, weighing on economic output over time. ""Financial conditions have tightened, which is likely to entail lower lending and activity if they persist,"" said the IMF, which hosts its spring meeting alongside the World Bank this week. If another shock to the world's financial system results in a ""sharp"" deterioration in financial conditions, global growth could slow to 1% this year, the IMF warned. That would mean ""near-stagnant income per capita."" The group put the probably of this happening at about 15%. The IMF acknowledged forecasting was difficult in this climate. The ""fog around the world economic outlook has thickened,"" it said. And it warned that weak growth would likely persist for years. Looking ahead to 2028, global growth is estimated at 3%, the lowest medium-term forecast since 1990.  The IMF said this sluggishness was attributable in part to scarring from the pandemic, aging workforces and geopolitical fragmentation, pointing to Britain's decision to leave the European Union, economic tensions between the United States and China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Interest rates in advanced economies are likely to revert to their pre-pandemic levels once the current spell of high inflation has passed, the IMF also said.     The body's forecast for global growth this year is now closer to that of the World Bank. David Malpass, the outgoing World Bank president, told reporters Monday that the group now saw a 2% expansion in output in 2023, up from 1.7% predicted in January, Reuters has reported. Not 2008, but... In a separate report published Tuesday, the IMF said that while the rapid increase in interest rates was straining banks and other financial firms, there were fundamental differences from the 2008 global financial crisis.  Banks now have much more capital to be able to withstand shocks. They also have curbed risky lending due to stricter regulations.  Instead, the IMF pointed to similarities between the latest banking turmoil and the US savings and loan crisis in the 1980s, when trouble at smaller institutions hurt confidence in the broader financial system. So far, investors are ""pricing a fairly optimistic scenario,"" the IMF noted in a blog based on the report, adding that access to credit was actually greater now than it had been in October.  ""While market participants see recession probabilities as high, they also expect the depth of the recession to be modest,"" the IMF said. Yet those expectations could be quickly upended. If inflation rises further, for example, investors could judge that interest rates will stay higher for longer, the group wrote in the blog.  ""Stresses could then reemerge in the financial system,"" it noted. That bolsters the need for decisive action by policymakers, the IMF said. It called for gaps in supervision and regulation to ""be addressed at once,"" citing the need in many countries for stronger plans to wind down failed banks and for improvements to deposit insurance programs. — Olesya Dmitracova contributed to this report.

                      A 26-year-old rookie Louisville police officer -- who graduated from the police academy just 11 days ago -- was hospitalized after being shot in the head while responding to a mass shooting Monday at a downtown bank that left five people dead and others injured, police said. Louisville Metro Police Department Officer Nickolas Wilt underwent brain surgery after being struck during a shootout in the bank that left the gunman dead, Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department, said Monday afternoon during a news conference. The officer was still in critical condition Tuesday afternoon.  ""They have him sedated. We are keeping our fingers crossed. It's just a wait and see,"" LaGrange Fire Chief Jim Sitzler told CNN. Wilt is a volunteer firefighter with the department, Sitzler said.  Wilt was new to the police department, having graduated from the police academy on March 31, according to the fire chief.  ""I just swore him in, and his family was there to witness his journey to become a police officer,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said.  Public service is in Wilt's DNA, Sitzler said.  ""He is an asset to the department,"" where he has volunteered since 2016, the fire chief said. ""He is young and ambitious."" ""Hopefully, he will recover enough where he can go to rehab,"" Sitzler said. ""One of our majors talked to his brother Zach ... (Nick) is going to have a long road ahead of him but he's young.""  Col. Deborah Berry, who worked with Wilt at the Oldham County EMS, said she wasn't surprised when Wilt decided to become a police officer.  ""It makes me so proud that he exemplifies what a true hero is,"" Berry said. Wilt had beem an emergency medical technician for several years in addition to being a firefighter, and ""he never, never turned away from any type of act that a lot of folks would run from,"" she told CNN's Erica Hill.  Wilt told Berry and others at the EMS that being a police officer was his dream, she said.  Wilt was led by a field training officer into the fatal workplace shooting, a law enforcement source describes.   The shooting at Old National Bank broke out just after 8:30 a.m. police said, about 30 minutes before the bank opens to the public.  Officers responded within three minutes of being dispatched and found the gunman was still firing inside the bank, authorities said. The shooter was identified by authorities as Connor Sturgeon, a 25-year-old employee.  Another officer was also injured in the attack and was hospitalized after being hit in the elbow, the chief said.  The five victims, all between the ages of 40 and 64, have been identified as Joshua Barrick, Deana Eckert, Tommy Elliott, Juliana Farmer and James Tutt. The victims included a close friend of Gov. Andy Beshear.  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg visited Wilt at the University of Louisville Hospital, telling CNN Wilt ""made it through surgery and he's in serious condition at the hospital right now but he is in great hands."" Greenberg had handed Wilt his graduation diploma from the police academy, he said. ""I paid a visit to his academy class that was there at the hospital offering to support him, offering the support to he and his family today,"" the mayor said. Wilts' father died recently of natural causes while he was in the police academy, the source says. And his brother is currently in the police academy.

                      What we know about the Daniel Perry case and what happens next after Texas' governor says he wants to pardon him

                      As the Texas pardons board weighs a request from the governor for an expedited review of the conviction of an Army sergeant who fatally shot a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally, an attorney for the victim's family is calling for the full legal process to play out first, including sentencing and an appeal. Daniel Perry, 35, was convicted Friday of murder in the fatal shooting of Garrett Foster, 28, at the rally in Austin in 2020, which followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Both men are White. The jury found Perry not guilty on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and a deadly conduct charge is still pending with the county attorney's office. ""I am working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a tweet Saturday. ""Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney."" Abbott said he asked the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite his requested review of Perry's conviction, noting Texas law doesn't allow him to approve a pardon without a recommendation from the board. ""I look forward to approving the Board's pardon recommendation as soon as it hits my desk,"" Abbott said in a statement. Perry's attorneys filed a motion Tuesday asking for a new trial, arguing that the defense team was not allowed to introduce evidence they believe showed Foster repeatedly instigated confrontations and harassed other drivers on the streets before the night of the deadly shooting. Travis County District Attorney José Garza's office responded to Tuesday's motion by saying it has ""full confidence in the guilty verdict."" ""These motions are standard motions filed by the defense following a guilty verdict,"" a statement from Garza's office reads. ""We applaud the defense team for making use of the procedural safeguards that are available to defendants in our criminal justice system. However, we continue to stand by the jury's unanimous decision to convict Daniel Perry for the murder of Garrett Foster."" Garza earlier called Abbott's intervention in the case ""deeply troubling."" ""Make no mistake, without intervention from the Governor, the defendant's conviction would be reviewed by both state and federal courts who will examine the record to ensure that no legal errors were made at this level and that the evidence supported the conviction,"" Garza said.  On Tuesday, Garza wrote to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles asking to meet with them to present evidence considered by jurors in the case, he said in a statement. He also asked the board to meet with Foster's family and consider the public safety implications of their decision before making a final recommendation.  ""For as long the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has existed, it has been a cautious steward of the power of clemency in our State,"" Garza said. ""We look forward to working with the Board to present all evidence necessary for its consideration.""  A civil attorney representing Foster's family also criticized Abbott's move for a pardon before the sentencing and appeals process, saying it ""turns the rule of law on its head."" Jurors in the case heard from 40 witnesses and deliberated for 15 hours, attorney Quentin Brogdon said in a statement, noting state and federal courts have the power to overturn the conviction if they find it was ""contrary to the rule of law."" ""Nobody, including the Governor of the State of Texas, should shut down that process, and any attempt to do so threatens the rule of law for all of us,"" Brogdon said. A judge is expected to set a sentencing hearing for Perry.  What happened in Austin  On the night of July 25, 2020, Perry, an active duty sergeant at nearby Fort Hood, was working as a rideshare driver to make extra money, his attorney Clint Broden previously said. He carried a handgun in his car for protection, Broden said. Perry dropped a passenger off near the rally, which he did not know was taking place, Broden added. Several people then began beating on Perry's car and a man carrying an assault-style rifle approached the car and motioned with the rifle for Perry to lower his window, according to Broden. ""Foster, the individual with the assault rifle, began to raise the AK-47 toward Sgt. Perry. It was only then that Sgt. Perry, who carried a handgun in his car for his own protection, fired on Foster because he believed his life to be in jeopardy,"" Broden has said. The prosecution argued Perry initiated the encounter by running a red light to turn into the crowd gathered for the police brutality protest and had previously posted on social media about shooting protesters, according to CNN affiliate KEYE. Then-Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said officers responded to a 911 call in which the caller stated they had just shot someone who approached their car window and pointed a rifle at them. One witness to the shooting, James Sasinowski, told CNN at the time that the driver of the car initiated the encounter by accelerating toward the protesters.  ""This was intentional. It was aggressive and he accelerated into a crowd of protesters,"" Sasinowski said. ""He could have waited for us to pass or he could have gone slowly. We would have allowed him to go through.""  How the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles makes its recommendation The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles confirmed Monday it had received a request from Abbott for an expedited pardon review for Perry. ""The board will be commencing that investigation immediately"" and will report to the governor with recommendations after the investigation is completed, Rachel Alderete, a spokesperson for the board, told CNN. CNN has asked for more information on how long the investigation could take and whether the appeal process needs to play out before the board can make a recommendation.  According to its website, the board uses ""research-based Parole Guidelines to assess offender's likelihood for a successful parole against the risk to society,"" when weighing parole decisions and also ""recommends clemency matters, including pardons, to the Governor."" Board members are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. Currently, there are seven members, all of whom were either appointed or reappointed to the board during Abbott's time in office. The governor has the power to pardon any crime after conviction, except treason or impeachment -- but only if a majority of board members approve the recommendation, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Abbott granted two pardons in 2022, eight in 2021 and seven in 2020, based on the parole board's recommendations, according to the Texas Tribune, all for lower-level offenses like theft, providing alcohol to a minor, assault by contact, burglary of a vehicle, credit card abuse and illegally carrying a firearm. In 2021, the board, citing procedural errors, withdrew George Floyd's Clemency recommendation after it previously voted unanimously to recommend a full posthumous pardon of Floyd for a 2004 drug conviction, according to hearing minutes provided by the board to CNN.  What Texas' 'stand your ground' law says Abbott's statement on his pardon request references Texas' ""stand your ground"" law, which he says is one of the strongest in the country. Stand your ground laws allow people to respond to threats with potentially lethal force without fear of criminal prosecution in a place where they have a right to be. Not all states have such a law and those that do, word -- and even enforce -- them differently. Thirty states have enacted stand your ground laws, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Texas law says a person can use force as a means of self-defense if they reasonably believe the force is immediately necessary to protect them against another's use or attempted use of force.  Supporters of the laws, including the National Rifle Association, say they give people the right to protect themselves, no matter where they are. Critics say the laws encourage violence and allow for legal racial bias.

                      Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other major cities could face huge water cuts in feds' proposed plan to save the Colorado River

                      The Biden administration on Tuesday released a highly anticipated analysis of the Colorado River crisis that paints a dire picture of what that river system's collapse would portend for the West's major cities, farmers and Native tribes.  In the draft analysis, the US Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation offers two different scenarios for how to slash water usage should the levels in Lakes Mead and Powell continue to plummet, with the immediate goal of keeping enough Colorado River flowing through the Glen Canyon and Hoover dams to supply hydroelectric power to hundreds of thousands of customers.  But the implications of the analysis go far beyond hydropower.   The Colorado River provides water and electricity to more than 40 million people in seven states: Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and California. Decades of overuse, combined with years of drought worsened by the climate crisis, have spurred a sharp drop in water levels in recent years at Lakes Mead and Powell, the nation's largest reservoirs that power Hoover and Glen Canyon and provide water for drinking and agriculture to millions.  In both of the federal government's scenarios, states, farms and tribes could be forced to cut nearly 2.1 million more acre-feet of their Colorado River usage in 2024, on top of existing water-conservation agreements struck in past years.  That is an enormous amount of water, roughly 684 billion gallons and nearly equivalent to what the entire state of Arizona was expected to use from the Colorado River this year.  The Interior Department is expected to make a final decision on the cuts -- and how and when they would be implemented -- later this summer.  After an epic winter full of record-breaking snow and flooding rainfall in the West, state water officials have said the pressure is easing to find an immediate solution to the Colorado River's woes. But Deputy Interior Sec. Tommy Beaudreau told CNN that the department didn't consider this year's historic winter in its analysis. 
            
            ""While it's encouraging, it's great, the long-term trend here has been continued drought and water shortages,"" Beaudreau said. ""But there's a chance even with a good water year that it just kind of pushes the curve out a few months and we have to continue our planning process accordingly.""  What the cuts would mean for cities, farmers and tribes As pressure mounts for the federal government to come up with a fair deal for water users, Camille Calimlim Touton, the Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner, said Tuesday in a news conference that the Colorado River ""is one community comprised of 40 million people and landscapes that need us to get this right."" Touton and other officials spoke Tuesday in front of Lake Mead's dramatic bathtub ring, showing how much the water levels there have fallen. And while the extent of the water cuts is the same in the two main scenarios, the difference lies in who would bear the brunt of the cuts.  In one, major Western cities -- including Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Phoenix -- would take the vast majority of the water cuts if Lake Mead levels were to plummet further, because these cities have a lower priority claim to the water, compared to farmers and Native tribes.   And it would be a major blow to those cities; 90% of Las Vegas' water supply comes from the river, while Phoenix's water supply is about 40% Colorado River water, for example.  ""For purposes of the analysis, we show what the effect would be,"" Beaudreau told CNN, adding he hopes the stark figures help spur an agreement among seven basin states.  The other scenario examines what would happen if the water cuts are spread equally among cities, farmers and tribes alike -- an option that some high-priority water users have warned could result in a prolonged, high-stakes court battle between states and the federal government.  There is also a third scenario the feds offered: Do nothing. But that is not an option states or the federal government are seriously considering as the Colorado River continues to decline.  Beaudreau called the no-action option the ""most severe"" for the river basin, but said it was important to include to emphasize why more cuts are so critical should water levels plummet further.  The federal government is trying to paint a picture that shows what a future with less water would actually look like, Beaudreau said, in hopes that sparring states can come together with a short-term agreement on cuts.   ""There has been a lot of negotiation and conversation among the states and with the Interior Department, but a lot of it's been conceptual and abstract,"" Beaudreau told CNN. ""Putting things down on paper to give direction I think will meaningfully move the conversation.""  Arizona's top water official Tom Buschatzke said the federal plan ""presents multiple paths forward, but those paths have dire consequences."" ""In some cases, it may spur opposition or even litigation,"" Buschatzke said at Tuesday's news conference. ""Instead, let us accelerate our discussions in the basin for a collaborative consensus-based outcome.""
             California's lead negotiator in the Colorado River talks, JB Hamby, echoed that sentiment, and said Arizona, California and the other states are looking to ""develop a true, seven-state consensus in the coming months -- ideally in the next 45-day period."" The two main scenarios may also not be what is finalized later this summer, as states continue to negotiate among themselves. And a third, less-severe option could ultimately emerge based on how water levels in Lakes Mead and Powell respond to this winter's rain and snow, as well as water cuts that are already being implemented across farms and cities in the Southwest, Beaudreau said.  Administration officials are incentivizing water cuts across agriculture in exchange for federal dollars. Last week, Beaudreau and other administration officials announced the first deal it signed in a series of short-term agreements to fallow water-intensive farmland and keep more water in Lake Mead. More fallowing agreements, some of which are still being negotiated, could be coming in the next few weeks.   The result of those programs could change the landscape enough by late summer that the feds could ramp down the extent of the water cuts in their final decision.  ""It all depends on how much the shortages are,"" he said. ""If there's conservation in the system that keeps water in Lake Mead, and we have to make minimal shortage reductions on top of [existing drought guidelines], that is an accomplishment in and of itself.""  A combination of those fallowing agreements and the good winter rain and snow are expected to raise elevations in Mead and Powell in the short term, which could stave off bigger cuts. State negotiators have told CNN they hope the good winter helps take some of the immediate pressure off and gives them more time to come to an agreement on water cuts.   
            Beaudreau said that while he hopes the seven states can strike a short-term deal, he doesn't yet know whether than can be achieved. If not, he reiterated Interior is prepared to act and implement cuts itself to keep the system from crashing.   ""I think this is a step towards facilitating what I hope is some consensus coming out of the basin, but it also shows at the end of the day, the [Interior] Secretary will do what's necessary and responsible to keep the system operating,"" Beaudreau said.

                      A 25-year-old bank employee in Louisville, Kentucky, wrote a note to loved ones before heading to his job Monday morning and opening fire -- killing five people and injuring eight others, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. The gunman, identified as Connor Sturgeon, started his attack around 8:30 a.m. at Old National Bank in downtown, authorities said. He opened fire as some employees met for a morning meeting before the bank was open to the public. Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN she watched the meeting virtually and witnessed her coworkers being slain.  Buchheit-Sims described Sturgeon as ""extremely intelligent"" and others who knew him told CNN they were shocked to see the violence, which launched a massive police response in the heart of one of America's most populated cities. But prior writings by the gunman indicate he struggled to fit in before he joined the team at Old National Bank.  Sturgeon had worked at the bank for more than a year, according to his LinkedIn profile. He livestreamed his attack on Instagram, a video that has since been removed from the platform.  A law enforcement source told CNN on Monday that the assailant had been notified that he was going to be fired from the bank. But Louisville's mayor and police chief have since said otherwise, with Louisville Metro Interim Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel telling CNN's Abby Phillip on Wednesday that that there ""was no discussion about this individual being terminated"" before the massacre. Gwinn-Villaroel said he did not have ""any prior engagement"" with police.   A search warrant was executed at Sturgeon's home Monday, Gwinn-Villaroel said in an interview with CNN Tuesday morning, noting she hopes items that were recovered will help shed light on a motive.  She did not say whether any other warrants had been executed as part of the investigation. The five victims, all between the ages of 40 and 64, were identified as Joshua Barrick, Juliana Farmer, Tommy Elliott, Deana Eckert and James Tutt, police said. Gov. Andy Beshear said Elliott, a senior vice president at the bank, was one of his closest friends.  Eight others were injured, including Nickolas Wilt, a 26-year-old police officer who graduated from the police academy just 10 days ago. Wilt was shot in the head during a confrontation with Sturgeon on Monday morning and was taken to the hospital where he underwent brain surgery, said Gwinn-Villaroel.  Shooter wrote a note before attack Sturgeon wrote a note to his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to open fire in the bank, the law enforcement source said.  It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source. Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining full time in June 2021.  Gunman was live streaming during rampage The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has since been taken down. Police are in possession of the video, according to the law enforcement source. Earlier on Monday, Gwinn-Villaroel said police were ""hopeful"" they could get the footage from the livestream taken offline.   ""I will say this, that the suspect was live streaming. And unfortunately, that's tragic. To know that that incident was out there and captured,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said.  Buchheit-Sims, a manager at the bank, told CNN Sturgeon had a ""monotone personality. His temperament is pretty low key. I've never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed.""  Buchheit-Sims said she didn't know anything about the shooter having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as ""extremely intelligent.""  Shooter didn't show red flags, classmate says  Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said.  Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and he was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports.  A former high school classmate of Sturgeon's who knew him and his family well said he never saw any ""sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.""  ""This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,"" said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. ""I can't even say how much this doesn't make sense. I can't believe it.""  Gunman wrote about difficulty fitting in In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school.  ""My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,"" the essay read. ""As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.""  The author wrote that in college, he had ""begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,"" and that he hoped to ""be more self-aware and start becoming a 'better' person.""  The gunman's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men's basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son's high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile.   A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon's alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said his son Connor inspired him to step down from the team.  ""Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,"" the article said.  This article has been updated with new information from authorities about the gunman's employment status.

                      ChatGPT can write sermons. Religious leaders don't know how to feel about it

                      The future of artificial intelligence promises technology with a human touch. But is it human enough to deliver a convincing spiritual message? Pastors and rabbis have recently discovered that ChatGPT, an AI language learning model that can spit out passable prose with just a few prompts, is not that bad at creating sermons -- a cornerstone of worship services across many religions.  Historically, these orations are based on generations of knowledge, keen textual analysis and scholarship, combined with the unique charisma and experiences of each worship leader. Sermon writing is considered an art. A divine calling, even.  Seeing a computer approximate similar works in mere seconds has led faith leaders to wrestle with an intriguing problem: Can AI replicate a truly human, spiritual message? And if it can, is the computer just that good, or does the human message need some work?  What an AI sermon sounds like In December 2022, Rabbi Joshua Franklin gave an unusual message during a service at the Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, New York.  ""I'm going to plagiarize a sermon,"" he told his congregation. ""And you have to guess who wrote it."" Franklin then delved into an illumination on the Parashat Vayigash, a portion of the Torah that tells the story of a reconciliation between brothers.  ""This is a powerful lesson for all of us, as it shows the importance of being willing to draw near to others even when it's difficult, in order to build intimacy and connection,"" he went on.  At the end of the roughly two minute sermon, Franklin revealed the real author to murmurs and scattered applause: ChatGPT.  ""You're clapping,"" he said. ""But I'm terrified!"" While Franklin added that he gave the language learning model a very specific prompt, and could see details in the work that wouldn't pass muster with a seasoned scholar, the experiment was received with equal parts awe and trepidation. Could the work of a faith leader -- so intimately tied to the human experience -- eventually be eclipsed by a computer?  How AI language modeling works  Popular entertainment does little to quell our human fears of an AI-generated future, one where computers achieve consciousness, ethics, souls, and ultimately humanity. In reality, artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT are just convincing mimics.  When CNN asked how it works, ChatGPT supplied the following response:  ""ChatGPT works using a deep learning algorithm called a transformer neural network. It was trained on a massive corpus of text data from the internet, books, and other sources. During training, the model learned to identify patterns in the data and use them to generate text that resembles human language."" ""The way ChatGPT creates an original response is by using a technique called language modeling,"" it continued. ""Language modeling is a task where the model is trained to predict the probability of the next word in a sentence given the previous words.""  Ultimately, the response may sound human -- maybe even human enough to satisfy a crowd expecting religious enlightenment.  Some experts say it's still evident there's something missing.  ""It lacks a soul -- I don't know how else to say it,"" Hershael York, a pastor and theology professor in Kentucky told the Associated Press.  However, because ChatGPT is ""trained on,"" or essentially fed, innumerable pieces of text, it can do some of the work of a scholar, referencing any sacred text it's trained on in a matter of seconds.  When asked what kinds of texts it would refer to for a Christian sermon, ChatGPT was at first hesitant, stating that as an AI language model, it did not ""hold personal beliefs or religious affiliations."" With a slightly altered inquiry, it provided the following:  ""When a language model like ChatGPT is asked to create a Christian sermon, it would typically rely on its training data and knowledge of Christian theology and practice. This includes a broad range of Christian texts, such as the Bible, commentaries, theological works, and books of sermons by other preachers."" ""To create a Christian sermon, the language model would typically be given a specific topic or theme to focus on,"" it continued. ""It would then search through its vast database of knowledge to find relevant information and examples related to that topic. This might involve identifying relevant Bible passages, theological concepts, and historical or cultural contexts that are related to the topic."" How a human sermon comes together  Sermon writing is a core skill for most worship leaders. Effective sermonists follow in the footsteps of celebrated faith leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Ozjasz Thon. ""The sermon has become the climactic element in a lot of denominations' services. A sermon is not simply teaching. It sets a precedent for understanding scripture correctly. And there's also this moment of exhortation, of asking what it says about our own lives,"" says Stu Strachan, an ordained Presbyterian pastor and founder of The Pastor's Workshop, a resource for Christian sermons and teachings.  ""There's also more value added to a sermon as culture becomes more secular. If churches want to grow, they have to connect their teachings to modern life and modern problems,"" he adds. In fact, sermons are so important that there is a thriving industry to provide tools to worship leaders to make the craft a little less taxing.  ""The reality is, unless you're a pastor you have no idea what it's like to be a pastor,"" Strachan tells CNN. ""It sounds obnoxious, but it's true, and it calls upon every aspect of who you are as a person. You are always on call, and more and more roles are foisted upon pastors. They're not just studying God's word, praying, visiting the congregation, they're expected to be CEO, CFO types who cast vision, manage staff, create strategic partnerships. There is a lot of burnout."" However, some methods of lessening the burdens can stretch the ethics of the position. Sermon ghostwriters aren't uncommon, and things can get dicey when a preacher doesn't disclose where they got their brilliant ideas.  ""I think some traditions value originality more than others. That being said, if you get a ghost writer, I think most pastors would heavily frown on it,"" Strachan says. ""However, from a practical money perspective, that's not something a lot of pastors can do. The average church congregation in the US is around 100 people, and the funds simply aren't there to pay someone to do that work for you."" Where AIs -- and humans --  fall short ChatGPT is free for the public to use, so it's easy to experiment with its possibilities -- and its limitations. Basic inputs like ""Write a sermon about X topic"" return basic results with very little detail or insight. The model returns more sophisticated results when the requests include detailed themes, specific text markers and the addition of common narrative devices like personal anecdotes, cultural references and quotations.  In other words, the quality of ChatGPT's output is only as good as the prompts it receives. Even then, it has some critical shortcomings: ChatGPT and other language learning models sometimes return inaccurate, incomplete or biased information; a weakness that is stated clearly on ChatGPT's interface.  Ken Sundet Jones, a professor of theology and philosophy at Grand View University in Des Moines, Iowa, summarized the other shortcomings he's seen in an article for the Christian nonprofit 1517.  ""Even if Pastor A.I. ChatGPT were able to move beyond the sermon as a dispensation of information, it would still miss the homiletical boat because it could only operate in the realm of a hypothetical audience,"" he writes. ""There's no particularity to what it produces and, thus, no 'for you' -ness to it."" Jones argues that the fact an AI is not human, and is not burdened at its very essence by the weight of life and death, means it cannot predict nor create something to soothe the human soul.  However, spiritual nourishment is the result of preaching at its best. Surely, like any other rhetorical art, sermon writing can be a lazy, inauthentic, and impersonal pursuit even when it's also done by a human.  A Twitter user illustrated this to amusing effect when she asked ChatGPT for a devotional loaded up with Christian-ish buzzwords like ""daddy God,"" ""covet your prayers,"" ""hedge of protection,"" and ""instruments of God."" The result was chaotic salad of platitudes and vague advice.  ""I know AI is dangerous because this reads like something I absolutely would've heard from a Christian influencer this week,"" someone jokingly replied. Exercises like these have led some faith experts through another line of logic: AI sermons lack an essential humanity. If they can produce something that can pass for someone's actual message, perhaps it, too, lacks an essential humanity.  ""Creativity requires independence, insight and imagination, all abilities that ChatGPT lacks,"" writes Chaim Steinmetz of the Jewish Journal.  ""But ChatGPT is not alone in pushing platitudes and humbug; many humans do so as well. If we find that our own opinions sound a lot like ChatGPT, that is not a flaw in it. Rather, it is the product of our own failings. Like a parrot, ChatGPT forces us to hear what we actually sound like."" Regardless of what it can create, there is one more element of strong religious rhetoric that artificial intelligence knows it will always lack: an actual human to deliver the message.  ""It's worth noting that while a language model like ChatGPT can provide an approximation of a sermon, it cannot replicate the full experience of a live sermon delivered by a human preacher,"" ChatGPT said during a conversation about how it produces sermons. ""The human element of preaching, including voice inflection, emotional expression, and audience interaction, is an important part of the preaching experience that a language model cannot replicate.""

                      Reinstated Tennessee lawmaker Justin Jones says he'll continue to call for gun reform
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/11/us/tennessee-democrat-representatives-expelled-tuesday/index.html,"
                      Apr 11, 2023
                    ","
                      After being sworn back into the Tennessee House of Representatives, a lawmaker who was expelled just days ago over a gun control demonstration on the chamber floor said he'll continue to call for gun reform. ""The first thing I do when I walk into this building as a representative is to continue that call for commonsense gun legislation,"" Democrat Justin Jones said as he stood on the steps of the Capitol after his reinstatement Monday. Jones and another Black Democrat, Justin J. Pearson, were forced out of the Republican-controlled legislature last week, after a protest on the chamber floor spurred by the mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead.  A third Democrat who had joined them in protest, Rep. Gloria Johnson, avoided expulsion. She is White. The Nashville Metropolitan Council voted 36-0 Monday to reappoint Jones to the House of Representatives, making him once again the representative of House District 52 -- but this time in the interim. State law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held.  ""Today we are sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence,"" Jones said to a cheering crowd Monday after marching back to the Capitol. Now technically a new member, Jones said he can file 15 bills. He'll be working on gun reform legislation as soon as he returns Tuesday, he told CNN on Monday evening. Each of those bills would have to do with gun reform, he said, because ""that's what these young people are begging us to do."" Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, announced Tuesday he would ask the General Assembly to strengthen the state's gun laws this session, with legislation instituting an ""order of protection law,"" which would allow officials to strip access to weapons from ""individuals who are a threat to themselves or our society.""  Regarding Jones' reinstatement, the Tennessee House Republicans released a statement on Monday, saying, ""Tennessee's constitution provides a pathway back from expulsion. Should any expelled member be reappointed, we will welcome them. Like everyone else, they are expected to follow the rules of the House as well as state law."" Jones' return ""just felt right,"" Johnson told ""CNN This Morning"" Tuesday, underscoring the need for ""young, passionate voices"" like Jones' and Pearson's who are willing to fight for their constituents.  ""It was so good to have him back in the body,"" she said, ""overwhelmingly supported by not only his district but every district in Davidson County."" Meanwhile, Pearson's still vacant District 86 seat is set to be addressed Wednesday during a Shelby County Board of Commissioners meeting in Memphis, announced Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery, who said Pearson's expulsion was ""conducted in a hasty manner without consideration of other corrective action methods."" ""To anyone who has doubted the South, anyone who's doubted the power of Tennesseans to advocate for an end to gun violence, anybody who's doubted the movement to end assault weapons -- anybody who's doubted the movement, here's your answer: The movement still lives,"" said Pearson as he stood on the steps of the Capitol alongside Jones on Monday. Pearson told CNN's John Berman that while Monday brought celebration of Jones' reinstatement, it was also another tragic day marked by a mass shooting in Louisville, Kentucky -- less than a month after the school shooting in Tennessee that prompted the lawmakers' protest. The shooting in Louisville points to a ""sobering reality that we are in that we are not doing enough to prevent gun violence,"" Pearson added. ""It's also a painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like (Speaker of the House) Cameron Sexton and the Republican party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all of the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,"" Pearson told CNN.  What happens next? Since there are more than 12 months until the next general election in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats, according to the Tennessee Constitution. No date has been set for a special election, but state law says the governor should schedule them within 55 to 60 days. It appears both Jones and Pearson qualify to run for their seats again in the special election. In the meantime, ""the legislative body of the replaced legislator's county of residence at the time of his or her election may elect an interim successor,"" the state Constitution says. Sexton, the Speaker of the House, indicated earlier Monday that he would not stand in the way of the appointments if the local governing bodies choose to send Jones and Pearson back to the chamber. ""The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats,"" a spokesperson for the speaker's office told CNN on Monday. ""Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires."" On Monday, Jones called for Sexton's resignation.  ""He is an enemy of democracy, and he doesn't deserve to be in that office of a speaker of the House any longer,"" Jones told CNN.  Johnson agreed, accusing Sexton of limiting debate on the House floor until last week, when the nation's eyes turned to watch the proceedings against Jones, Johnson and Pearson.  ""Before the hearings, we had more healthy debate on bills than I think we've ever had in three or four years on the House floor,"" she told CNN on Tuesday, ""because people were watching.""  CNN has reached out to Sexton for comment. In expelling Jones and Pearson last week, Republicans held a party-line vote to oust them, accusing them of ""knowingly and intentionally"" bringing ""disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives"" without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. While the state Constitution says members can be expelled for disorderly behavior with a two-thirds majority vote, they cannot be expelled ""a second time for the same offense.""  Expulsions were 'unconstitutional,' attorneys say Attorneys for the ousted representatives -- among them former US Attorney General Eric Holder -- sent a letter to Sexton Monday, calling their removals ""unconstitutional.""  ""Their partisan expulsion was extraordinary, illegal and without any historical or legal precedent,"" the attorneys said. Holder and attorney Scott J. Crosby -- who are representing Jones and Pearson, respectively -- urged the House to not ""compound its errors by taking any further retributive actions."" ""Any partisan retributive action, such as the discriminatory treatment of elected officials, or threats or actions to withhold funding for government programs, would constitute further unconstitutional action that would require redress,"" the letter says. The Congressional Black Caucus released a statement Monday after Jones was reinstated to his seat. ""While this is what the residents of Nashville deserve, we must recognize that Rep. Jones was reappointed to his position not because the Republican majority did the right thing, but because Rep. Jones' constituents in Nashville, joined by supporters from all over our country, peacefully voiced their concerns about the prevalence of gun violence in our communities and the ongoing assault by Republicans on our democracy,"" the statement read.

                      The mother of a 6-year-old who shot his first-grade teacher in Newport News, Virginia, in January has been indicted on charges of felony child neglect, and one count of recklessly leaving a firearm to endanger a child, a news release from the office of the Commonwealth's Attorney said Monday. The child will not be criminally charged, Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney Howard Gwynn said last month. Deja Taylor's son shot his teacher Abigail Zwerner, 25, on January 6 at Richneck Elementary School, leaving her in the hospital with gunshot wounds to her hand and chest, investigators said. The gun was purchased by Taylor and was kept on the top shelf of her bedroom closet, secured by a trigger lock, an attorney representing the family told CNN in January. The child brought the gun to school in his backpack, police said. The indictment comes after a ""thorough investigation"" from the police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's office, according to the news release. James Ellenson, one of the attorneys for the family, said in a statement Tuesday that Taylor, 26, ""has cooperated from the first day of the incident,"" and intends to turn herself in by the end of the week. ""As always, first and foremost is the continued health and wellbeing of all persons involved in the incident at Richneck Elementary School, to include both the teacher and Deja's son,"" the statement said.   The boy has an ""acute disability"" and was under a care plan which required a parent to attend school with him, though he was unaccompanied on the day of the shooting, the family has said in a statement. ""We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,"" the statement read. A lawsuit brought this month by Zwerner alleges school administrators and the school board were aware of the student's ""history of random violence"" and did not act proactively amid concerns over a firearm in the boy's possession the day of the shooting. Ellenson said last week the allegations in the lawsuit against the child and the family ""should be taken with a large grain of salt."" ""We of course continue to pray for Ms. Zwerner's complete recovery,"" Ellenson said without commenting further on the lawsuit.  In the lawsuit, which seeks $40 million in compensatory damages, an attorney for Zwerner alleges school staff and administrators at Richneck Elementary School were aware the child was violent at home and his parents refused to place him in special education classrooms. According to the court document, during the first half of the school year, the 6-year-old was required to be accompanied by a parent during the school day ""because of his violent tendencies."" But that day, school administrators ""allowed him to remain unaccompanied without a one-on-one companion during the school day,"" the complaint says. The suit also alleges the school's then-assistant principal ignored concerns and warning signs flagged by several teachers and staff members, including that the 6-year-old may have had a firearm in his possession in the hours leading up to the January 6 shooting. A guidance counselor and administrator at the elementary school said assistant principal Ebony Parker also ""forbade"" teachers from searching the 6-year-old for a firearm, saying his ""mother would be arriving soon to pick him up,"" the complaint says. Diane Toscano, an attorney for Zwerner, said Monday the lawsuit makes it clear ""we believe the school division violated state law."" ""There were failures in accountability at multiple levels that led to Abby being shot and almost killed. Today's announcement addresses but one of those failures,"" Toscano said in an email. ""It has been three months of investigation and still so many unanswered questions remain."" The fallout from the incident was swift, drawing harsh criticism from parents and leading the school board to vote to oust Superintendent George Parker III. Ebony Parker resigned two weeks after the shooting and the principal, Briana Foster Newton, was reassigned to another school, though the district did not say where. CNN requested comment from Parker about the lawsuit but has not heard back. The circuit court has also asked to impanel a special grand jury to continue the investigation, according to the Commonwealth's Attorney's news release. ""The Special Grand Jury will investigate to determine whether additional charges against additional persons are justified by the facts and the law,"" Gwynn said in the release. ""If the Special Grand Jury determines that additional persons are criminally responsible under the law, it can return additional indictments."" In her first interview since the shooting, Zwerner told NBC in March she can't forget the look on the child's face as he aimed the gun at her. ""I remember him pointing the gun at me, I remember the look on his face,"" Zwerner said. ""I remember the gun going off."" Asked about her recovery, Zwerner said, ""I've been doing OK. It's been challenging."" ""Some days are not-so-good days where I can't get up out of bed,"" she told NBC. ""Some days are better than others where I'm able to get out of bed and make it to my appointments. But from going through what I've gone through, I try to stay positive.""

                      Japan on Tuesday announced plans to develop and build an array of advanced long-range missiles as it bolsters its defenses amid increasing tensions with neighboring China. The Japanese Defense Ministry said it had signed contracts with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) to develop and mass produce the weapons under a plan extending to 2027.  The deals, worth more than $2.8 billion, follow Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's announcement in December that he planned to boost defense spending and enable Japan to possess ""counterstrike capabilities,"" the ability to directly attack another country's territory in the event of an emergency and under specific circumstances.  In taking the new defense initiatives, Japan is bending the interpretation of its post-World War II constitution, which put constraints on its Self-Defense Forces in that they can only be used for what their name implies, defending the Japanese homeland. Under the deals, MHI will begin mass production this year on two types of already developed missiles -- ground-launched Type 12 guided missiles designed to target ships at sea and hypersonic glide missiles designed for island defense, the ministry said. Deployment of those weapons is scheduled for 2026 and 2027, it said. The Defense Ministry news release did not say how many of each missile would be acquired. Meanwhile, MHI will this year begin development of advanced versions of the Type 12 that can also be launched by aircraft and ships. Defense industry news site Janes reported that the updgraded Type 12 will have a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), five times the reach of the current version. At the same time, MHI will begin development of submarine-launched missiles that could be fired by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force's fleet of conventionally powered boats. In December, Kishida instructed his defense and finance ministers to secure funds to increase Japan's defense budget to 2% of current GDP in 2027. Along with the development of Japan's own missiles, Kishida said in February the country planned to buy as many as 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the United States. Tomahawks can hit targets as far as 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) away. Japan's military buildup comes amid increasing tensions with China, which has been growing its naval and air forces in areas near Japan while claiming the Senkaku Islands, an uninhabited Japanese-controlled chain in the East China Sea, as its sovereign territory. Meanwhile, China has been upping its military pressure on Taiwan, the self-ruled island whose security Japanese leaders have said is vital to that of Japan. Just this week, Japan scrambled fighter jets as a Chinese aircraft carrier group came within 230 kilometers (143 miles) of the southern Japanese island of Miyako while it simulated strikes on Taiwan. Chinese military exercises around Taiwan last August including the launching of ballistic missiles, some of which landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.

                      Persistent inflation remains the Federal Reserve's No. 1 concern, even as the banking sector remains on edge after two big bank failures last month. This week's Consumer Price Index, due to be announced Wednesday at 8:30 am ET, could determine whether the central bank raises rates again in May. That means it will also weigh on markets, especially now that Wall Street's focus has shifted from the financial system to the economy.  ""Inflation is no less relevant than it has been for the past two years,"" wrote Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. ""The Consumer Price Index remains the most-watched monthly economic report.""  So what are they expecting? What's happening: Core inflation levels have eased for five months in a row on an annual basis, according to CPI readings, but they still remain near historic highs at 6% -- well above the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%.  Last month's reading showed an increase in prices between January and February, which doesn't ""inspire confidence that 2% is just around the corner,"" said McBride.  For March, economists forecast a 0.4% monthly increase in the CPI, which matches the September - February average and would keep those year-over-year averages high.  So what will it take to make the Fed, and investors, happy?  ""To feel good about where inflation is headed, we need to see more than just moderation in the rate of both headline and core inflation,"" said McBride. ""We also need to see moderation in price pressures across a wide range of categories that are staples of the household budget: shelter, food, electricity, motor vehicle insurance, apparel, and household furnishings and operations."" But ""resiliently elevated prices have the potential to spark yet another Fed rate hike in May,"" said Greg Bassuk, CEO at AXS Investments. That's notwithstanding the slowing economy ""that has been weighed down even more heavily by the banking system debacle,"" he added.  What it means for markets: Between inflation data and the start to the first-quarter corporate earnings season (three of the largest US banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup report this Friday), this week is set up for heightened stock volatility, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management.  ""Persistent inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty over the pace of earnings growth in 2023 remain headwinds to advancing equity prices. Each will be in focus this week,"" he said.  Retail investors are buying bank stocks  TD Ameritrade released its March Investor Movement Index on Monday, which tracks what retail investors are up to.  The report found that retail traders continued to be net buyers of equities in March. That means Main Street traders, not large financial institutions, are purchasing the majority of new stock in the US. The increasing power of the retail investor -- fueled by stimulus cash, easier access to trading platforms and more market education amongst other things, has been an ongoing trend since the beginning of the pandemic. Lately, large companies have begun to change their investor relations strategies to become more retail investor friendly. Now even the 'smart money' traders are using Reddit for stock tips. So where are they investing? The strongest buying interest is in the Financial sector, found TD Ameritrade. That comes despite macroeconomic catalysts in March like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the emergency sale of Credit Suisse.  ""March was full of surprises, but the overall impact among TD Ameritrade retail clients when it came to exposure to the markets was neutral,"" said Lorraine Gavican-Kerr, managing director at TD Ameritrade. ""For the second month in a row, our clients were net buyers of equities, seemingly eying an opportunity to buy into the Financial sector's lows and to sell off the highs in Information Technology."" The five most popular stocks to purchase, according to TD Ameritrade were Tesla, Rivian, Ford Motors, Amazon, and the embattled First Republic Bank.  Retail investors, meanwhile, were net sellers of Meta, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devises, Intel and Apple.  NY Fed says short-term inflation expectations have increased Inflation expectations have increased at the short-term and medium-term horizons, according to The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's March Survey of Consumer Expectations, released on Monday.  Inflation expectations for the year ahead have increased by half a percentage point to 4.7%, the survey found. That marks the first increase since October 2022.  The survey, which questions about 1,300 household heads in the US each month, also found that respondents were more pessimistic about the outlook for the US labor market than they were in previous months. Unemployment expectations — or the probability that the US unemployment rate will be higher one year from now — increased by 1.3 percentage points to 40.7%, the New York Fed found.  The recent banking crisis and looming credit crunch also appears to be worrying households in the United States. The Fed reported that ""perceptions of credit access compared to a year ago deteriorated in March."" The share of households that said it's harder to obtain credit than one year ago reached an all time high.

                      Some customers are complaining the new olive oil-infused Starbucks drink is making them run to the bathroom

                      Starbucks is betting big on olive oil infused coffee, hoping customers will be enticed by the anomaly and the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil.  ""It is one of the biggest launches we've had in decades,"" Brady Brewer, Starbucks' chief marketing officer, told CNN. Former CEO Howard Schultz added in an interview with Poppy Harlow that it will ""transform the coffee industry,"" and be ""a very profitable new addition to the company."" But what the company may not have taken into account: Some customers say it's making them have to run to the bathroom.  ""Half the team tried it yesterday and a few ended up... needing to use the restroom, if ya know what I mean,"" a barista on the Starbucks Reddit page posted. CNN has reached out to the Redditor for comment.  It might be the sheen from the oil. Or it could be the aftertaste. Social media was swift with condemning the drink -- and the after effects. ""That oleato drink from starbs makin my stomach speak,"" one user tweeted.  Those with sensitive stomachs are already wary.  ""IBD patient here. I wouldn't touch these drinks with a ten-foot pole,"" one Redditor said.  The new platform, Oleato, rolled out in Italy in February. Each beverage -- an oat milk latte, ice shaken espresso with oat milk and a golden foam cold brew -- are made with a spoonful of oil, adding 120 calories to a drink. Select Starbucks stores in Seattle and Los Angeles and Reserves in Chicago, Seattle and New York are now serving the platform of beverages.  CNN has reached out to Starbucks for comment.  Science behind the pain Olive oil is a staple in Mediterranean culture and some drink bits of olive oil in the region daily.  But the Starbucks drink has a potentially fragile combination: caffeine, which is a stimulant, and olive oil, which is a relaxant.  A 16-ounce drink has as much as 34 grams of fat, which is more than what many find in a meal, registered dietitian nutritionist Erin Palinski-Wade said. And olive oil can help soften the stool, making it easier to go the bathroom. ""If you combined high fat in a meal or in a beverage along with coffee, which already stimulates the bowels,"" Palinski-Wade said, ""that combination can cause cramping. It can cause increased mobility in the colon and therefore have that laxative effect."" Some customers said the speed at which they had to use the restroom after having the drink caught them off guard. But high fat meals take longer to digest than liquid olive oil, which will hit the digestive track faster, Palinski-Wade said. And most people in the US are drinking coffee on the go and aren't pairing the drink with any carbohydrates and fibers to negate the impact.  The benefits of olive oil are widely circulated, linked to lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease to lowering blood pressure (though the positive health outcomes could be because the Mediterranean diet replaces unhealthy fats like butter with olive oil, The New York Times reported.) ""(The drink) is not going to make somebody physically ill from the standpoint of having a negative impact on health,"" Palinski-Wade said. ""But more of that uncomfortable feeling of having to go in the bathroom or potentially cramping."" In the Mediterranean, taking a spoonful of olive oil a day is part of a daily routine. Former CEO Howard Schultz picked up this habit himself from olive oil producer Tommaso Asaro while in Sicily, Italy. ""When we got together and started doing this ritual I said to [Asaro], I know you think I'm going to be crazy, but have you ever thought of infusing a tablespoon of olive oil with Starbucks coffee?"" Schultz told CNN's Poppy Harlow. ""He thought it was a little strange."" Asaro is the chairman of United Olive Oil, through which Starbucks is sourcing its olive oil.  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly categorized olive oil.

                      The distinctive gas grills in Chipotle restaurants might be a thing of the past. On Tuesday, the fast casual Mexican chain unveiled an all-electric restaurant design that is completely powered by renewable energy, such as solar and wind. That means the gas grills that have become the focal point for walk-in customers are being replaced by electric systems, which are intended to help the chain achieve its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.  Noticeable changes in this new store format include rooftop solar panels, electric vehicle charging stations and biodegradable flatware and bowls. Other changes include cactus-leather chairs and artwork made from recycled rice husks. Chipotle will tweak the design based on feedback from customers and employees, the company said.  So far, two of these new locations have opened in Gloucester, Virginia and Jacksonville, Florida, with a third opening this summer in Castle Rock, Colorado. The goal is to have 100 new locations operating entirely on electricity next year, which is a small percentage of the long-sought goal of operating 7,000 locations across North America over the next several years.  The chain currently owns and operates 3,200 restaurants in the United States. Sustainability has long been a focus for Chipotle, which, along with other fast food chains, has been criticized for not being environmentally friendly. The chain is also increasing the amount of produce bought locally to cut down on fuel used during the transportation process, and is developing more vegan and vegetarian menu items. Chipotle is constantly tweaking its store designs. It's currently experimenting with designs that are smaller than its typical footprint and focuses on digital ordering so it can build new locations in urban areas where real estate is pricier.

                      Former senior executives of Twitter have sued the company in an attempt to recover more than $1 million in legal expenses incurred by responding to shareholder lawsuits, federal investigations and a congressional hearing, according to a complaint filed Monday in Delaware Chancery Court.  The lawsuit by former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, former chief legal officer Vijaya Gadde and former chief financial officer Ned Segal alleges that Twitter has failed to reimburse them for lawyers' fees in accordance with prior agreements with the company. Elon Musk fired the executives immediately after completing his acquisition of the company.   Twitter, which cut much of its public relations team last year, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The complaint was first reported by The New York Times.  According to exhibits filed with the complaint, Gadde alone spent more than $1 million preparing for her testimony in February before the House Oversight Committee, when the panel held a hearing focused on allegations that Twitter censored conservative speech. The complaint also describes legal fees linked to probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, though without disclosing many specifics of the investigations. The references to federal investigations underscore the continuing legal risk for Twitter under Musk, who is simultaneously struggling to shore up company finances while pushing a skeleton crew to make significant changes to the product. The SEC has previously probed Musk's investment in and deal to buy Twitter, including his apparent delay in disclosing his large ownership stake in the social media company. And last month, the Federal Trade Commission acknowledged a wide-ranging investigation into Twitter's privacy practices. The Justice Department has not previously confirmed any investigation into the company. The lawsuit outlines some details about the DOJ and SEC probes. It claims that Agrawal and Segal first began receiving requests from US officials around July of last year. Agrawal continued to field requests through the fall and after he stepped down from Twitter, according to the complaint. And late last year, it said, the Justice Department contacted Agrawal and Segal's attorneys about multiple investigations into Twitter.  Letters to Twitter seeking reimbursement for the legal expenses were ignored for months, according to the complaint. In March, the company allegedly responded by acknowledging the requests for reimbursement, but took no action to pay. As of Monday, the executives still have not recovered the fees, the complaint said.

                      Cineworld's stock plummeted 36% Tuesday afternoon to an all-time low after the company said it had filed a plan to reorganize its business and shareholders would not recover any of their funds.  The embattled owner of Regal Cinemas said it had submitted a final version of the plan to a US bankruptcy court in Texas. It first announced details of the proposal on April 3. The company said already back in February that it expected shareholders to be wiped out entirely by the bankruptcy process, even if it sold some of its businesses. ""The proposed restructuring does not provide for any recovery for holders of Cineworld's existing equity interests,"" the company confirmed in a statement Tuesday.  Under the plan, Cineworld's lenders will cut its debt by $4.5 billion in exchange for equity in the reorganized company. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, described the market reaction to Cineworld's announcement Tuesday as ""severe."" Confirmation of the plan had ""extinguished any remaining hope from shareholders that this route could be avoided,"" she told CNN.  Like many of its competitors, the world's second-biggest movie theater operator was hit hard by the pandemic, reporting a combined loss of $3.3 billion over 2020 and 2021. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States in September.  Cineworld shares have lost 98% of their value since the company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. They were last trading at 1.1 pence (1.4 cents).   The stock closed 33% lower on April 3 after the company announced its reorganization plan and said it would halt all efforts to sell its US, UK and Irish businesses.  Tuesday's stock declines came as ""remaining equity holders rushed to sell their shares in an attempt to recoup something,"" Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, an online trading platform, told CNN. Cineworld reiterated that it hoped the restructuring plan — which the court and some of the company's creditors have yet to approve — would help it emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the first half of this year. In the meantime, Cineworld said, its movie theaters will continue to operate ""as usual without interruption.""

Tony Danker is leaving the Confederation of British Industry with immediate effect, the group said in a statement Tuesday. Three other employees have been suspended ""pending further investigation into a number of ongoing allegations.""  ""We apologize to the victims of this organizational failure, including those impacted by the revulsion we have all felt at hearing their stories,"" the CBI said. ""We wish to thank all those who have had the courage to speak out, through internal or external channels, and encourage them to keep doing so.""  Danker, who stepped aside in early March while the investigation took place, had previously apologized ""profusely,"" saying that any ""offense"" he caused was unintentional. On Tuesday, he reiterated his apology on Twitter and said he was ""shocked"" to hear of his dismissal ""instead of being invited to put my position forward as was originally confirmed.""   The CBI did not specify what wrongdoing it had found but stressed that Danker was ""not the subject of any of the more recent allegations"" of misconduct at the organization.  Danker will be replaced by Rain Newton-Smith, the former chief economist of the CBI. The CBI, which was founded in 1965, represents about 190,000 UK businesses.

                      Alibaba showed off its answer to the ChatGPT craze on Tuesday, demonstrating new software that it plans to eventually roll out across all its platforms. The Chinese tech giant unveiled Tongyi Qianwen, a large language model that will be embedded in its Tmall Genie smart speakers and workplace messaging platform DingTalk. It was trained on vast troves of data in order to generate compelling responses to users' prompts. The technology will initially be integrated into those two products and eventually added to all Alibaba applications, from e-commerce to mapping services, according to the company. Group CEO Daniel Zhang, who also oversees Alibaba's cloud division, presented the new AI-powered service at a conference in Beijing, where the company demonstrated how it will allow users to transcribe meeting notes, craft business pitches and tell children's stories. The company has opened up Tongyi Qianwen — which roughly translates as ""seeking truth by asking a thousand questions"" — to enterprise customers for testing before making it available to more users. ""We are at a technological watershed moment, driven by generative AI and cloud computing,"" Zhang said. Generative AI refers to the technology that underpins platforms like ChatGPT. The service has exploded in popularity in recent months, and Chinese tech companies have been racing to release their own versions, prompting some critics to predict that the trend will add fuel to an existing US-China rivalry in emerging technologies. Customized models Alibaba, which has a large cloud computing business, will also allow clients of that division to use the new technology to build their own customized large language models, the firm said in a statement. The debut comes after that of Baidu, which launched its own ChatGPT-style service last month. During a similar presentation, Baidu showed how its chatbot, called ERNIE, could generate a company newsletter, come up with a corporate slogan and solve a math riddle. On Monday, SenseTime, one of China's most prominent AI companies, launched a suite of new services, including a chatbot called SenseChat. China will be setting rules to govern the operation of such services. In draft guidelines issued Tuesday to solicit public feedback, the country's cyberspace regulator said generative AI services would be required to undergo security reviews before they can operate. Service providers will also be required to verify users' real identities. In addition, they must provide information about the scale and type of data they use, their basic algorithms and other technical information. Alibaba's shares in Hong Kong ticked up 1.6% following its demonstration.  The company announced last month that it planned to split its business into six units. Most of those units, including its cloud services business that oversees AI projects, will be authorized to raise capital and pursue public listings. — Juliana Liu contributed to this report.

                      The Dalai Lama has apologized after a video emerged showing the spiritual leader kissing a child on the lips and then asking him to ""suck my tongue"" at an event in northern India. In a statement Monday, the office for the Dalai Lama said he ""wishes to apologize to the boy and his family, as well as his many friends across the world, for the hurt his words may have caused,"" adding he ""regrets"" the incident.  ""His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras,"" the statement said.  His apology comes after a video of the exchange, which took place during an event in the hillside city of Dharamshala in February, went viral on social media with many users criticizing the Dalai Lama's actions. In the video, the young boy can be seen approaching the Nobel Peace Prize winner before asking, ""Can I hug you?""  The 87-year-old spiritual leader then invites the boy on stage and points to his cheek and says, ""first here,"" prompting the boy to give him a hug and a kiss.  The Dalai Lama then points to his lips, and says: ""then I think finally here also."" He then pulls the boy's chin and kisses him on the mouth. ""And suck my tongue,"" he says after a few seconds, poking his tongue out.  The identity of the boy is not known. He was at an event with the M3M Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Indian real estate company M3M Group, based in Dharamshala, where the Dalai Lama lives in permanent exile. CNN has reached out to the M3M Foundation for comment.  In response to the incident, prominent Delhi-based child rights group, Haq: Center for Child Rights, told CNN in a statement it condemns ""all form of child abuse."" It added: ""Some news refers to Tibetan culture about showing tongue, but this video is certainly not about any cultural expression and even if it is, such cultural expressions are not acceptable."" Some of the Dalai Lama's supporters have decried the criticism, however, arguing the leader's actions have been misinterpreted under a Western lens.  ""Expression of emotions and manners today has been melted together and become vividly westernized,"" Namdol Lhagyari, a Tibetan activist in exile, wrote on Twitter. ""Bringing in narrative of other cultures, customs and social influence on gender and sexuality to interpret Tibetan way of expression is heinous.""  Sticking out one's tongue is a sign of respect or agreement and was often used as a greeting in traditional Tibetan culture, according to the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the world's best-known living Buddhist figure.  The principal spiritual leader of the ""Yellow Hat"" school of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama is revered by millions as the reincarnation of his 13 predecessors.  The spiritual leader has been based in India since 1959, following an unsuccessful Tibetan uprising against Chinese occupation. He later established a government-in-exile in the northern Indian city of Dharamshala, leading thousands of Tibetans who followed him there. February's incident isn't the first time the octogenarian has sparked controversy in recent years.  He apologized after a 2019 interview with the BBC, during which he said if a female Dalai Lama should succeed him, she ""should be more attractive.""  The previous year, he suggested Europe should be kept for Europeans, when speaking about the rising level of African refugees entering the continent.  ""The whole Europe (will) eventually become Muslim country? Impossible. Or African country? Also impossible,"" he said, adding that it's better to ""keep Europe for Europeans.""

                      Shelter-in-place order lifted for neighborhoods near a burning fishing vessel in Washington

                      A shelter-in-place order has been lifted for neighborhoods near a burning fishing vessel in the Hylebos Waterway in Tacoma, Washington, officials said.  The vessel -- which was still burning Monday and believed to be carrying 55,000 gallons of diesel and 19,000 pounds of freon -- caught fire early Saturday morning while moored in the waterway, the US Coast Guard said in a news release. The shelter-in-place order was issued after a ""significant explosion"" took place and fire conditions worsened, officials said.  By Monday, smoke conditions had improved. The US Environmental Protection Agency was still monitoring air quality, the Coast Guard said.  Crews were still trying to ""cool the haul, as the fire burns itself out"" with high-powered streams of water, the Tacoma Fire Department said Monday. ""While it appears that most of the flammable material onboard has burned, it is likely that smoke will continue to be visible throughout the day,"" the department said.  The explosion was linked to a heated compressed gas cylinder on the vessel, Port of Tacoma officials said Sunday night, citing fire officials. ""We were very fortunate that the fire was quickly spotted and reported and the crew onboard was able to safely evacuate,"" US Coast Guard Lt. Stephen Nolan told CNN affiliate KING-TV Sunday. By Sunday, the fire had spread throughout the vessel and was about 100 feet from the ship's freon tanks, according to the Coast Guard. Freon is a trademark name typically used to refer to several different refrigerants, including chlorofluorocarbons, according to the EPA. As the fire continues to burn, the heat from the flames can build pressure in the freon tanks, which have built-in heat-activated pressure relief valves designed to release pressure from the tanks in an emergency, according to the Coast Guard. ""While freon can be toxic if inhaled in large quantities or in a confined space, the release of freon into the atmosphere is not expected to pose any health and safety risks to the public,"" the Coast Guard said. Still, the Tacoma Fire Department asked residents of the Northeast Tacoma, Browns Point and Dash Point neighborhoods to ""remain indoors and limit exposures to smoke."" ""Residents concerned about smoky conditions can provide additional protections by keeping doors closed and shutting outside air vents. Residents may also want to avoid any strenuous activity or exercise outdoors,"" the mayor tweeted. The EPA has been monitoring the air in the surrounding areas, and first responders have deployed floating barriers around the vessel to contain any spills, according to the Coast Guard's news release.  The Coast Guard has also closed the Hylebos Waterway for all commercial and recreational vessel traffic.  As of Sunday night, no injuries had been reported and there were no signs of maritime pollution, the Coast Guard said. As crews continue to battle the fire with cooling spray, it remains unclear what ignited the blaze. Authorities said the cause of the fire remains under investigation.

                      Our live coverage of the Louisville bank shooting has moved here.  The death toll in the Louisville bank shooting has risen to five, the Louisville Metro Police Department said late Monday. President Joe Biden spoke by phone to Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear Monday evening about the shooting at a Louisville bank that left four people dead, the White House said. In a statement earlier Monday, Biden called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. He said Congress needs to act on things like requiring safe storage of guns and background checks. A survivor of workplace gun violence himself, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said he lost a very close friend, Thomas Elliot, in the Old National Bank shooting.  Greenberg said he was with Elliot's wife at the hospital earlier Monday morning. Elliot, a senior vice president at the bank, was also a close friend of Gov. Andy Beshear.   “It is painful, painful for all of the families I know,” he said speaking with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “It just hits home in a unique way when you know one of the victims so well.” The mayor said he also visited Louisville Metro Police Officer Nickolas Wilt at the University of Louisville hospital saying he “made it through surgery and he's in serious condition at the hospital right now, but he is in great hands.”  Greenberg said he handed Wilt his graduation diploma from the police academy just a week and a half ago.  “I paid a visit to his academy class that was there at the hospital offering to support him, offering the support to he and his family today.” Rebecca Buchheit-Sims, a manager with Old National Bank, told CNN she virtually witnessed the shooting Monday through her computer during a Microsoft Teams meeting.  “Shortly after the meeting started, the gunman, which is an employee, started shooting up the conference room,” Buchheit-Sims said. “I witnessed people being murdered. I don’t know how else to say that.”  “I’m just as much in shock and disbelief and was in disbelief as I watched it unravel,” she said of the incident, which she said “happened very quickly.”  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work with the gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.  She described Sturgeon as someone with “just kind of a monotone personality.""  “His temperament is pretty low-key. I’ve never seen the kid get angry or upset about anything in public. He was pretty much just relaxed,"" she said.  Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t know anything about Sturgeon having any grievances or previously making any threats. She recalled him as “extremely intelligent.”    At least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fire at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday morning. Here's what we know so far: Shooter: Police identified the gunman as Connor Sturgeon, 25, who was an employee at the bank. (At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age Monday afternoon.) Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be fired, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation, and wrote a note that indicated that he was going to shoot at the bank. He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department. 
            Response: Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.
            Investigation: Police did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are ""hopeful"" that they can get the footage taken offline.
            Victims: The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according to updated information from the police department. Nine people were taken to the hospital, said Dr. Jason Smith, the chief medical officer at the University of Louisville Health. Three people have since been discharged, he said. Three others are in critical condition, including a recently graduated police officer who was shot in the head and had to have brain surgery, Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also injured.
            Reaction: President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting and called on Congress to act on gun reform. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville in Congress, and State Sen. Karen Berg, who also represents parts of the city, also called for action to address gun violence. Gov. Andy Beshear said one of the victims, Tommy Elliot, was ""one of my closest friends"" and that the community will also mourn and miss all of the other victims. ##Catch Up## The city of Louisville will set up a family assistance center, in cooperation with the Red Cross, to help those affected by Monday’s bank shooting “deal with the trauma of this moment,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said Monday afternoon.  “To the survivors and the families, our entire city is here to wrap our arms around you,” Greenberg said, adding that he is a survivor of a workplace shooting himself. “I’m a survivor of a workplace shooting. To the people who survived, whether you were physically hurt or not, I know that you’re hurting too. We are here for you as well,” Greenberg said.  In a statement Monday, Greenberg called the shooting at Old National Bank “another horrific tragedy” and asked for prayers for the “recovery of those who are receiving medical care, the families of those who lost a loved one, and those who are scared and heartbroken by what has happened this morning.” “Our deepest gratitude to the heroic efforts of first responders, who arrived within minutes of being called, and who risked their lives to save others. We will continue to provide updates throughout the day,” Greenberg said. CNN’s Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Monday repeatedly called on Congress to take actions to address gun violence, refusing to explicitly say whether President Joe Biden has exhausted all legal efforts to further combat the issue through executive action.  When asked during the White House press briefing if the president is at the end of his ability to do more on gun violence prevention, Jean-Pierre said, “So, there [are] actions that we have taken. The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”  The comments came hours after four people were killed in a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.  Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.  Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”  She said Biden has ""done a historic amount of work recently"" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year. Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.  She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all. We were just being mindful to the incoming information that was currently coming in from Louisville.”  Louisville shooter Connor Sturgeon was notified that he was going to be terminated from Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.  Sturgeon wrote a note for his parents and a friend indicating that he was going to shoot at the bank, the source said.  It is not clear whether that note was on paper or emailed, or whether it was seen before the incident or after, according to the source.  The shooting was live-streamed on Instagram and has been taken down. Police are in possession of the video, according to the source. Connor Sturgeon, the 25-year-old identified by police as the gunman in Monday's mass shooting in Louisville, had worked for more than a year at the bank where he allegedly shot 13 people, killing at least four. At a news conference earlier Monday, police had described the shooter as a 23-year-old male. They amended his age to 25 later in the day.)  Sturgeon wrote on his LinkedIn profile that he interned at Old National Bank in Louisville for three consecutive summers between 2018 and 2020 before joining as a Commercial Development Professional in June 2021. He became a Syndications Associate and Portfolio Banker at the bank in April 2022, according to the profile. Sturgeon graduated from the University of Alabama in December 2020, according to a spokesperson for the university. He participated in an accelerated master's program, and earned both his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in finance at the same time, the spokesperson, Shane Dorrill, said. Earlier, Sturgeon played basketball and ran track for his high school in a Louisville suburb, and was named a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship in 2015, according to local news reports. A former high school classmate of Sturgeon’s who knew him and his family well said he never saw any “sort of red flag or signal that this could ever happen.” “This is a total shock. He was a really good kid who came from a really good family,” said the classmate, who asked not to be identified and has not spoken with Sturgeon in recent years. “I can’t even say how much this doesn’t make sense. I can’t believe it.” In a 2018 college essay posted to the website CourseHero, a user identified as a University of Alabama student named Connor Sturgeon wrote that he had had trouble fitting in at school. “My self-esteem has long been a problem for me,” the essay read. “As a late bloomer in middle and high school, I struggled to a certain extent to fit in, and this has given me a somewhat negative self-image that persists today. Making friends has never been especially easy, so I have more experience than most in operating alone.” The author wrote that in college, he had “begun to mature socially and am beginning to see improvement in this area,” and that he hoped to “be more self-aware and start becoming a ‘better’ person.” Sturgeon's father, Todd Sturgeon, was head coach of the men’s basketball team at the University of Indianapolis for 10 years and later coached basketball and taught US history at his son’s high school, according to news reports and his LinkedIn profile. A 2007 story published by Todd Sturgeon’s alma mater, DePauw University, quoted an Indianapolis Star article about his retirement from the University of Indianapolis that year, in which he said that watching his son Connor had inspired him to step down from the team. “Todd Sturgeon said he was watching his son, Connor, at a basketball camp recently when he had a realization: Maybe he'd rather have more time to spend with his own sons than other people's,” the article said. All state flags throughout Kentucky have been ordered to fly at half-staff until Friday evening to honor the victims of the Louisville bank shooting, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday.   “We are one commonwealth — united with the city, united with these families,” Beshear said at a news conference. Police said at least four people were killed and nine others were taken to the hospital. Three of them remain in critical condition, the hospital said. The Louisville Police Department did not have ""any prior engagement"" with the man who is accused of killing at least four people at a bank Monday morning. Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department, said they are still working to learn more about the gunman. The shooter was killed by police shortly after he opened fire, police said. The gunman was shot and killed by police officers who were responding to the scene, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the Louisville Metro Police Department. She said police got a call that there was a shooting at 8:35 a.m. ET and arrived at the bank three minutes later. Gwinn-Villaroel said officers ""responded in a timely, quick fashion, and we stopped the threat so that no additional loss of life could be taken."" Police previously said the gunman was dead, but did not confirm if he was shot by police or a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter was live streaming the attack on a Kentucky bank Monday morning, the interim chief of the Louisville police department said during a press conference. ""I will say this, that the suspect was live streaming. And unfortunately, that's tragic. To know that that incident was out there and captured,"" LMPD interim chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. Gwinn-Villaroel said that police are ""hopeful"" that they can get the footage taken offline. She didn't specify on what platform the suspect was live-streaming the shooting. Police released the names Monday of the four people who died following a mass shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank. Here are the victims: Tommy Elliott, 63
            Jim Tutt, 64
            Josh Barrick, 40
            Juliana Farmer, 45  The post has been updated with the latest information from the police department on the victims' ages. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said that one of those killed in the mass shooting Monday morning in Louisville was ""one of my closest friends."" Beshear said that Tommy Elliott, ""helped me build my law career. Help me become governor. Gave me advice on being a good dad.""  “He’s one of the people I talked to most in the world and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend,” the governor said. Elliott was the senior vice president of the bank, according to his LinkedIn. The governor said he received incorrect information earlier when he stated in a news conference that a second friend had been killed.  The governor also called the other deceased victims of the shooting ""amazing people"" whose communities will ""mourn"" and ""miss them."" CNN’s Celina Tebor contributed reporting to this post A Louisville Metro Police Department officer was shot in the head during a confrontation with the gunman Monday morning, said Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the police department. Nickolas Wilt, 26, was taken to the hospital and had brain surgery, she said during a news conference following the mass shooting that left four people dead. ""He is in critical but stable condition,"" she said. Wilt was new to the department, having graduated from the police academy at the end of March, she said. ""This will be a long complex investigation involving local, state and our federal partners,"" Gwinn-Villaroel said. One other officer was also shot in the elbow, she said. Police identified the suspected shooter that killed at least four people at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, as Connor Sturgeon, a 25-year-old male.  He was employed at the bank, according to Louisville Metro Police Interim Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel.  The shooter's ""weapon of choice"" was a rifle, Gwinn-Villaroel said.  The shooter died after officers exchanged gunfire with him, police added.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect age for the shooter based on information from police. He was 25. Kentucky officials are giving an update on the death of at least four people in a mass shooting at a bank in Louisville on Monday morning. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Gov. Andy Beshear are expected to give remarks. Police have said they believe there was only one shooter and that the gunman was a former employee of the bank. A local hospital received nine patients, two of them were police officers, according to officials. Three of them have been discharged, the hospital said. Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been briefed on the shooting that killed at least four people in Louisville, Kentucky, according to DHS spokesperson Marsha Espinosa. The secretary has been in contact with officials in the state, Espinosa said. Other federal officials have also been briefed on the shooting, including Attorney General Merrick Garland and President Joe Biden, the Justice Department and the White House said earlier. An officer hospitalized following the shooting at a Louisville, Kentucky, bank is in critical condition, University of Louisville Hospital officials told CNN. Louisville police previously said at a news conference the officer was undergoing surgery. Two police officers were among nine people hospitalized following the shooting, hospital officials said. The University of Louisville Hospital received nine patients following a shooting at Old National Bank on Monday, hospital officials told CNN. Three of those nine patients have been discharged from the hospital, a spokesperson from the hospital said. Hospital officials will hold a press briefing with the Louisville mayor and Louisville Metro Police Department at 3 p.m. Monday. The manager at a brewery less than a block away from Old National Bank where at least four people were killed in a shooting Monday said the incident hits ""close to home."" Jason Smith, the operations manager at Against the Grain, a brewery in Louisville, said he was just arriving to work when he saw all first responders coming to the scene of the shooting at Old National Bank. The brewery is less than 500 feet away from the bank and both businesses are on the same street.  “Although we didn’t need to shelter in place, it kind of took a few minutes to figure out what was going on and assess the situation,” Smith told CNN affiliate WDRB.  Smith said the brewery has opened its doors to first responders, the mayor’s and governor’s teams, some chaplains, and said some of the employees from the bank have also come to the brewery. “I mean, these are our neighbors, you know, so we’re here to support and take care of them. We’re thinking about them,” Smith said.   President Joe Biden condemned the latest mass shooting Monday at a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, where four people were killed and nine others were injured. “Once again, our nation mourns after a senseless act of gun violence – Jill and I pray for the lives lost and impacted by today's shooting. Too many Americans are paying for the price of inaction with their lives. When will Republicans in Congress act to protect our communities?” Biden said in a tweet marking his first reaction to the shooting.  The current reality of a divided Congress makes additional legislative action highly unlikely.  In a second statement on the shooting, the president again called out Republicans for what he said is a lack of action to protect communities. Biden said a ""strong majority of Americans"" want some kind of gun safety reform. He called for things like requiring safe storage of guns, background checks and changes to when gun manufacturers can be found liable. “Instead, from Florida to North Carolina to the U.S. House of Representatives, we’ve watched Republican officials double down on dangerous bills that make our schools, places of worship, and communities less safe. It’s unconscionable, it’s reckless, and too many Americans are paying with their lives,"" the president said. ##Reactions## Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on the fatal Louisville bank shooting, a Justice Department spokesperson said. Earlier today, the White House said President Joe Biden was informed of the shooting and the administration will have more to share later on.  Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvery, who represents Louisville, Kentucky, called for action on gun violence in the wake of the shooting in his district today.  “Our community is one of far too many impacted by gun violence,” McGarvey said in a statement on Twitter. He said the shooting ""serves as a stark reminder that we need to address gun violence at the national level so no other family loses a son, a daughter, and a loved one.” He also thanked first responders for their quick action.  Read McGarvery's full statement: Kentucky state lawmakers are also calling for gun reform. State Sen. Karen Berg, who represents District 26 which includes parts of Louisville, said it's ""past time for action."" Berg said in a tweet that it is ""time to address common sense gun legislation,"" pointing out specific areas she wants to see change, including discussing red flag laws. State Rep. Lamin Swann, who represents a district near Lexington, tweeted, ""Common sense gun legislation NOW!"" Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed McGarvery's calls for ""stronger gun safety legislation"" in the other chamber of Congress. He said in a tweet the country grieves for those killed and their families, but noted that ""this cannot continue."" He said that lawmakers need to continue working for gun reform legislation. After a shooting at an elementary school in Nashville at the end of March, Schumer would not say whether he would put legislation to ban assault weapons on the Senate floor for a vote.  ##Reactions## The city of Louisville, Kentucky, has set up a family assistance center to help anyone looking to reunite with people involved in the bank shooting that killed at least four on Monday. The center is located at the Kentucky International Convention Center, Mayor Craig Greenberg said on Twitter. Read the tweet: The gun used in the Louisville bank shooting was an AR-15-style rifle, a federal law enforcement source tells CNN. Police believe the “lone gunman” in the shooting “did have a connection to the bank,” where at least four were killed. While authorities are still working to establish that connection, they said it appears he was a previous employee, police said at a briefing Monday morning.

The Louisville Metro Police said earlier Monday that they were responding to “an active aggressor” on the 300 block of East Main Street in Louisville, Kentucky, adding “there are multiple casualties.”  FBI Louisville described the incident as a shooting, and other officials urged residents to stay away from the area. At least five people have been killed, according to a police briefing at the scene. The Louisville metro area, located along Kentucky’s border with Indiana, has a population of about 630,000 people as of the 2020 Census.  The 300 block of East Main Street is bordered to the east by the minor league stadium Louisville Slugger Field and includes a bank, dentist’s office, a furniture store and the Louisville Ballet. Watch law enforcement give an update: At least five people have been killed and at least six people have been transported to University of Louisville hospital, including one officer, with “various injuries,"" police said. The status of those transported are unknown at this time.  The shooter is confirmed to be dead and circumstances of his death are unknown, police said at a briefing at the scene. There is no active danger at this time, police said. A man speaking to WLKY says he got a call from his wife who said there was an active shooter and she was locked in a vault at Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky.  The man, Caleb Goodlett called 911 but officers were already aware. He described it as a traumatic phone call at 8:30 a.m. local time – where his wife was calling him from a phone inside the bank vault, where she was sheltering. He has since talked to and seen his wife saying, “She’s fine” CNN has reported the shooter is “down” and the incident is over. There are six victims, including one police officer, in the downtown Louisville, Kentucky, shooting, according to preliminary information from a source with direct knowledge of the scene on the ground.  There were shots exchanged between the shooter and the police during the incident. The shooter is ""down,"" according to the source and the incident is over. It is unclear if the shooter is one of the six victims.  The condition of the victims is unknown and all have been transported to University Hospital. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says that he is heading to the scene after a shooting situation with “multiple casualties” in downtown Louisville. ""LMPD has confirmed a shooting situation in downtown Louisville with multiple casualties,"" Beshear said in a tweet. ""I am headed there now.

                      Lori Vallow Daybell, Idaho mother accused of killing her children and conspiring to kill husband's ex-wife, was motivated by 'money, power and sex,' prosecutors say

                      An Idaho mother who is accused of killing her two children and conspiring to kill her husband's ex-wife was motivated by ""money, power and sex,"" prosecutors said as opening statements in her trial began Monday, according to CNN affiliate East Idaho News. Lori Vallow Daybell is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of conspiracy in the deaths as well as grand theft for collecting government benefits on behalf of her children after they were killed, the indictment states.  She has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Jury selection took place last week. Fremont County Prosecutor Lindsey Blake told the jury on Monday that Vallow Daybell ""used money, power, and sex to get what she wanted. It didn't matter what it was,"" East Idaho News reported. The sensational case, featured in a Netflix true-crime documentary last year, involves the deaths of a number of family members and claims Vallow Daybell and her husband had apocalyptic religious beliefs. Two of Vallow Daybell's children from previous marriages, Tylee Ryan, 17, and Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow, 7, were last seen on different days in September 2019. Shortly after that, she married Chad Daybell, whose ex-wife Tammy Daybell had died several weeks prior. ""The defendant will remove any obstacle in her way to get what she wants -- and she wanted Chad Daybell,"" Blake said, according to East Idaho News. Daybell and Vallow Daybell called themselves ""James and Elaina"" and believed they were religious figures and had a system of rating people as ""light"" or ""dark,"" the prosecutor told jurors. Jim Archibald, an attorney for Vallow Daybell, painted a different picture Monday, saying in court: ""The evidence will show Lori was a kind and loving mother. The evidence will show Lori had an interest in religion -- especially the end of times."" ""Some people could care less about biblical prophecies, some people care a lot about it. Thankfully in this country we get the freedom to choose,"" said Archibald, according to the East Idaho News report. Archibald told the jury that prosecutors don't have enough evidence to prove Vallow Daybell's guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""Did she kill or did she assist or did she encourage or did she command? They (prosecutors) aren't sure what happened -- but they want you to be sure,"" Archibald told the jury, according to East Idaho News. In late November 2019, relatives asked police in Rexburg to do a welfare check on JJ because they hadn't talked to him recently. Police didn't find him at the family's house but did see Vallow Daybell and Daybell, who said JJ was staying with a family friend in Arizona, according to authorities.  When police returned the next day to serve a search warrant, the couple was gone. They were ultimately found in Hawaii in January 2020. In June 2020, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee and JJ on Daybell's property in Fremont County, Idaho, and Vallow Daybell and Daybell were indicted on murder charges in May 2021. ""You will hear it described as a mass of bone and tissue,"" Blake said during opening statements Monday, describing how Tylee's remains were found. ""That's what was left of this beautiful young woman. The defendant's daughter,"" Blake said, according to East Idaho News. JJ's body was wrapped in a plastic bag, according to Blake. Daybell, Vallow Daybell and her brother Alex Cox conspired to kill the children and Daybell's ex-wife, the indictment states. Vallow Daybell and Daybell ""did endorse and teach religious beliefs for the purpose of justifying"" the killings of JJ, Tylee, and Tammy Daybell, the indictment notes. In particular, Daybell and Vallow Daybell exchanged texts about Tammy Daybell ""being in Limbo"" and ""being possessed by a spirit named Viola,"" according to the indictment. Those close to the couple said they had been involved in strong religious ideologies. JJ Vallow's grandmother, Kay Woodcock, was the first witness to take the stand Monday, testifying that her regular phone calls with her grandson dropped off after the death of Vallow Daybell's ex-husband, Charles Vallow, East Idaho News reported. The grandmother said the last conversation she had with JJ Vallow was on August 10, 2019, when she spoke to him during a short call that lasted less than a minute. She said she attempted over the next few months to contact her grandson, but never got any response from Vallow Daybell. Arizona police released body camera footage from January 2019 of Vallow Daybell's ex-husband saying he could not get in touch with the children. He said their marriage had rapidly deteriorated and ""she thinks she's a resurrected being and a god."" In addition, Daybell was connected to a religious doomsday prepper website which describes itself as a ""series of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation."" The publishers of the site said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow Daybell in light of the children's disappearance. Vallow Daybell was initially ruled not mentally fit to stand trial, but a judge reversed the determination last year. Daybell's trial will be held separately. Vallow Daybell won't face the death penalty if convicted, a judge ruled last month. Both have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Vallow Daybell has separately been charged in Arizona with conspiracy to commit murder in the July 2019 death of her estranged husband Charles Vallow. He was fatally shot by her brother Alex Cox, who later died in December 2019. CNN has reached out to prosecutors regarding those charges.

                      As the Pentagon investigates a major leak of classified documents that recently turned up on social media sites, dozens of them remain viewable on Twitter. This type of sensitive government information can slip under the radar for weeks, analysts say, because some social networks lack policies against posting classified information. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""CNN's 5 Things"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Louisville shooting A 25-year-old bank employee opened fire at his workplace in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday and livestreamed the attack that left five dead and eight others injured, authorities said. The gunman was killed by police after a shootout that wounded two officers, leaving one in critical condition. According to a source familiar with the investigation, the gunman left behind a note for his parents and a friend indicating he planned to carry out a shooting at his workplace, though it is unclear when the message was found. Monday's massacre is the 146th mass shooting so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving another community in mourning while lawmakers clash over possible gun violence solutions. 2. Covid-19 President Joe Biden signed a bill Monday ending the national emergency for Covid-19 -- months before he intended for the declarations to cease. One White House official downplayed the bill, saying that ""to be clear, ending the National Emergency will not impact the planned wind-down of the Public Health Emergency on May 11"" -- which enabled the government to provide many Americans with Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines at no charge. ""Since Congress moved to undo the National Emergency earlier than intended, we've been working with agencies to address the impacts of ending the declaration early,"" the official said. The bill to end the national emergency cleared the Senate last month in a bipartisan 68-23 vote and passed the GOP-led House earlier this year. The White House had signaled strong opposition to the bill but said Biden would sign it if it came across his desk. 3. Fungus Almost 100 confirmed or probable cases of a rare fungal infection known as blastomycosis have been linked to a Michigan paper mill, health officials say. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the CDC. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won't get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Nineteen cases have been linked with the Billerud Paper Mill in the town of Escanaba and another 74 are probable, meaning the person has symptoms. Typically, there are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, the CDC said. 4. Ukraine Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, in what Ukraine's top land commander calls ""scorched Earth"" tactics. Meanwhile, Ukraine is working to hold back Russian forces in the region, with more than 20 attacks repelled within 24 hours, according to Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces. Separately, the US State Department on Monday officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich as ""wrongfully detained"" by Russia. This designation will empower the US to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure his release. Gershkovich was detained in late March and formally charged with espionage last Friday. 5. Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama has apologized after a video emerged showing the spiritual leader kissing a child on the lips and then asking him to ""suck my tongue"" at an event in northern India. In a statement Monday, the office for the Dalai Lama said he ""wishes to apologize to the boy and his family, as well as his many friends across the world, for the hurt his words may have caused,"" adding he ""regrets"" the incident. ""His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras,"" the statement said. His apology comes after a video of the exchange, which took place in February, went viral on social media -- with many users criticizing the Dalai Lama's actions. Some of his supporters, on the other hand, argue the leader's actions have been misinterpreted under a Western lens.

                      Iowa's attorney general has paused funding for sexual assault victims' Plan B and abortions

                      Iowa's Attorney General has paused funding for emergency contraception and abortions for sexual assault victims, according to an email Iowa's Coalition Against Sexual Assault received that was also shared with CNN. The email was sent from Chief Deputy Attorney General Sam Langholz. Attorney General Brenna Bird's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Langholz told the nonprofit that a review of victim's services is ongoing and the Attorney General has not made a final decision on whether the payments will resume.  ""While not required by Iowa law, the victim compensation fund has previously paid for Plan B and abortions. As a part of her top-down, bottom-up audit of victim assistance, Attorney General Bird is carefully evaluating whether this is an appropriate use of public funds,"" Bird's Press Secretary Alyssa Brouillet said in a statement to the Des Moines Register. ""Until that review is complete, payment of these pending claims will be delayed."" Langholz shared the same statement from Bird's press secretary in the email obtained by CNN.  Under the 1979 Iowa Sexual Abuse Examination Payment Program, victims of sexual assault in Iowa are ""never responsible for a sexual abuse forensic examination or for medications required due to the assault,"" according to Iowa's Victim Assistance annual report.  Though it was not explicitly required, it has been the state's longtime policy to cover the cost of emergency contraception under the victim compensation fund, and in rare cases, the fund has also paid for abortions for rape victims, Sandi Tibbetts Murphy, director of the victim assistance division under the previous attorney general, told the Des Moines Register. After Bird took office, Tibbetts Murphy resigned at request of the new attorney general, the Des Moines Register reported. Funds for the program are entirely made up of fines and penalties paid by convicted criminals, rather than general taxpayer money -- a point victim advocacy groups emphasize.  ""Victims of rape and child abuse have an acute need for timely access to health services, including contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy and abortion care. Cost should never be a barrier for rape victims seeking medical care,"" Iowa's Coalition Against Sexual Assault said in a statement Monday, urging the attorney general to continue the payments to sexual assault victims. ""Using offender accountability victim compensation funds to cover the cost of forensic exams, incentivizes victims to undergo an invasive exam that can help prevent offenders from victimizing others and enhance access to medical care for crime victims.""  Ruth Richardson, CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, called Bird's decision ""deplorable and reprehensible,"" saying it ""further demonstrates politicians' crusade against Iowans' health and rights,"" according to a statement.  Bird, a Republican, won her election in 2022 in a race that largely focused on abortion after her Democratic opponent declined to defend Iowa's ""fetal heartbeat"" law, which would ban most abortions after about six weeks.  During her campaign, Bird said, ""I am pro-life and I will defend the laws that are passed by the Legislature.""  Iowa's Coalition Against Sexual Assault says that ensuring victims are not responsible for the cost of a forensic exam or for needed medications after an assault is ""key to encouraging victims to undergo this extremely invasive medical exam as soon as possible after a violent assault."" Juveniles accounted for the majority of sexual abuse victim costs paid for by Iowa's state victim compensation funds, according to a 2021 Iowa's Victim Assistance report. Nearly 2.9 million women across the US experienced rape-related pregnancy during their lifetime, according to a study published in 2018 by the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.  ""Emergency contraception should be provided to victims of sexual assault, requiring its immediate availability in hospitals and other facilities where sexual assault victims are treated,"" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says on its website.

                      Taiwanese are rushing to buy patches being worn by their air force pilots that depict a Formosan black bear punching Winnie the Pooh -- representing China's leader Xi Jinping -- as a defiant symbol of the island's resistance to Chinese military exercises. China began three days of military drills around Taiwan on Saturday, a day after the island's president, Tsai Ing-wen, returned from a brief visit to the United States, where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy despite Beijing's warnings. Chinese censors have long targeted representations of Winnie the Pooh -- created by British author A.A. Milne -- over internet memes that compare the fictional bear to China's leader. Alec Hsu, who designed the patch, has been selling it at his shop since last year, but he saw a spike in orders after Taiwan's military news agency on Saturday published a photo of the patch on the arm of a pilot inspecting a fighter jet. ""I wanted to boost the morale of our troops through designing this patch,"" said Hsu, who owns Wings Fan Goods Shop. Hsu said he has ordered more patches to meet the increased demand. Customers have included military officers and civilians. The patch shows an angry Formosan black bear holding Taiwan's flag and punching Winnie the Pooh, with the slogan ""Scramble!"" -- referring to what the island's pilots have had to do with increased frequency over the past three years as China sends more aircraft into Taiwan's air defense identification zone -- a self-declared buffer that extends beyond the island's airspace. The endangered Formosan black bear is seen as a symbol of Taiwanese identity. Taiwan was previously better known internationally as Formosa. ""Where can we get a patch like that! Guaranteed to be best sellers!"" Taiwan's de facto embassy in the United States wrote in a tweet on Monday. Taiwan's air force told Reuters that while it does not ""particularly encourage"" its members to wear the patch, which is not a part of their uniform, it ""will maintain an open attitude"" to anything that raises morale. China's Communist Party claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory despite never having controlled it and has not ruled out taking the island by force. Tsai's government rejects China's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future. While the Winnie the Pooh patch cannot be found on Chinese social media, Beijing has also been promoting videos and commentary about its drills around Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army Eastern Theatre Command, the Chinese unit that would be at the frontline of any military action against Taiwan, released a video on Monday showing scenes from the drill, set against upbeat music. The video targeted a Taiwanese audience by using traditional Chinese characters, which are still used in Taiwan but no longer in mainland China. Chinese military drills China's drills focused on practicing ""maritime blockades"" and ""targeted ambush assaults on enemy mooring vessels"" in the Taiwan Strait, as well as northwest, southwest and waters east of Taiwan, Chinese state media reported reported. Over the weekend, multiple PLA services had carried out ""simulated joint precision strikes on key targets on Taiwan Island"" and in the surrounding waters, state media reported. Analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said the PLA was ""practicing and probably refining the aerial coordination and joint operations required to initiate a blockade of Taiwan's ports and air lanes."" A Chinese blockade of Taiwan could choke off supplies coming into the island, including any military aid or other shipments from the United States or its partners. The US, through the Taiwan Relations Act, is legally obligated to provide Taiwan with defensive weaponry, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attempted Chinese attack. Beijing had repeatedly warned against Tsai's meeting with McCarthy and threatened to take ""strong and resolute measures"" if it went ahead. After the drills commenced, Beijing described them as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Taiwan Defense Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said the PLA's exercises had ""destabilized"" the region. ""President Tsai's visit became their excuse to conduct exercises and their actions have severely jeopardized the security of the surrounding region,"" he said, adding that the island's air defense units were on ""high alert."" Beijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island.

                      UN tells Afghan staff to stay home after Taliban bans women from working with the organization

                      The United Nations said it was being forced into making an ""appalling choice"" after instructing all of its personnel in Afghanistan to stay away from its offices in the country, following the Taliban's ban on female Afghan aid workers. ""UN national personnel -- women and men -- have been instructed not to report to UN offices, with only limited and calibrated exceptions made for critical tasks,"" the organization said in a statement. It comes after Afghan men working for the UN in Kabul stayed home last week in solidarity with their female colleagues. The UN said the Taliban's move was an extension of a previous ban, enforced last December, that prohibited Afghan women from working for national and international non-governmental organizations. The decree forced the UN ""into having to make an appalling choice between staying and delivering in support of the Afghan people and standing by the norms and principles we are duty-bound to uphold,"" the organization said in a statement Tuesday. It added that the ban was ""the latest in a series of discriminatory measures implemented by the Taliban de facto authorities with the goal of severely restricting women and girls' participation in most areas of public and daily life in Afghanistan."" The UN will continue to ""assess the scope, parameters and consequences of the ban, and pause activities where impeded,"" the statement said, adding that the ""matter will be under constant review."" Several female UN staff in the country had already experienced restrictions on their movements since the Taliban seized power in 2021, including harassment and detention. Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN Deputy Special Representative, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, called the Taliban's decision an ""unparalleled violation of human rights"" last week. ""The lives of Afghanistan women are at stake,"" he said, adding, ""It is not possible to reach women without women."" The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, is engaging with the Taliban at the highest level to ""seek an immediate reversal of the order,"" the UN said last week. ""In the history of the United Nations, no other regime has ever tried to ban women from working for the Organization just because they are women. This decision represents an assault against women, the fundamental principles of the UN, and on international law,"" Otunbayeva said. Other figures within the organization also condemned the move, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calling it ""utterly despicable."" After the Taliban banned female aid workers in December, at least half a dozen major foreign aid groups temporarily suspended their operations in Afghanistan -- diminishing the already scarce resources available to a country in dire need of them. The Taliban's return to power preceded a deepening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, worsening issues that had long plagued the country. After the takeover, the US and its allies froze about $7 billion of the country's foreign reserves and cut off international funding -- crippling an economy heavily dependent on overseas aid.

                      Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below. Two videos emerged on social media this past week that appear to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. The videos appear to be of separate events. One of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other — from the amount of foliage seen on the ground — looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker’s identification. “[The armoured vehicle] got f**ked by a mine,” the voice, speaking Russian, says.  Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, “They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.”  The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.  Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war’s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video’s location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground. It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. Shortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: “There will be an accountability for everything.”  An official Ukrainian government Telegram channel said the tweet was a direct reference to “another execution video published by Russians.”  Monday, the Institute for the Study of War said that Wagner was “reportedly continuing to commit war crimes by beheading Ukrainian servicemen in Bakhmut,” referencing a photo shared on pro-Russian social media sites showing what appeared to be a severed head mounted on a spike, which they claimed belonged to a Ukrainian soldier. The ISW has reported similar incidents in Popasna, in the Luhansk region, where Wagner troops were also operating earlier in the war. Some pro-Russian social media accounts have suggested Ukrainian forces were responsible for the beheadings in an effort to conceal identification. This echoes a similar claim made by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in January after his fighters apparently found bodies with severed hands and heads near Bakhmut. The CIA assesses that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “not serious about negotiations at this stage” of the war in Ukraine and it is “Ukrainian progress on the battlefield that is most likely to shape prospects for diplomacy” to end the ongoing conflict, CIA Director Bill Burns said on Tuesday. Speaking publicly for the first time, at Rice University, since leaked classified US military documents appeared online, Burns stressed the importance of Ukraine’s planned offensive, saying “a great deal is at stake in the coming months.” “Instead of backing down, he has doubled down,” Burns said about Putin, adding the Russian president believes he can grind down Ukraine and the West.  The CIA director specifically mentioned that Ukraine continues to defend the Donbas region, which one of the leaked intelligence documents says is likely heading for a stalemate.  ""Russia's grinding campaign of attrition in the Donbas region is likely heading toward a stalemate, thwarting Moscow's goal to capture the entire region in 2023,"" states one of the classified documents.  “Real countries fight back,” Burns said on Tuesday, adding that Ukraine and its president have done just that. “Putin was profoundly mistaken” in his assumptions about Ukraine before the war, Burns added. Burns emphasized the importance of continued US support for Ukraine, including through intelligence sharing, at a time when the leaked classified documents are raising questions about the administration’s view of the conflict. The CIA director made these statements at Rice University, where he's discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s aggressive posturing, Iran’s nuclear enrichment and other pressing foreign policy issues at school’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, according to the school's website. CIA Director Bill Burns said Tuesday he expects more nuclear saber rattling from Russia as its war in Ukraine continues, but his agency does not “see evidence of preparations for any potential use of nuclear weapons.” Burns said the CIA does not see any “significant change in nuclear deployments by Russian leadership."" He also said the leak of classified military documents represents an urgent problem for the US that is “as intense as anything” in the current moment.  Burns — stressing the importance of balancing both short-term and long-term issues —  specifically pointed to the leak as an immediate problem the US intelligence agencies are grappling with. The CIA director noted that the Justice Department is currently investigating the leak and declined to elaborate further on his understanding of the issue. Burns made these statements at Rice University Tuesday, where he's discussing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s aggressive posturing, Iran’s nuclear enrichment and other pressing foreign policy issues at school’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, according to the school's website. ##Pentagon Docs## The highly classified leaked Pentagon documents posted to social media offer a pessimistic US view of the war's progress in Ukraine.  The documents highlight flaws in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses and predict a stalemate in the war for months to come. The documents, which appear to date from February and March, detail many of Ukraine's perceived military shortfalls as Kyiv prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.  Several of the classified documents warn Ukraine's medium-range air defenses to protect front-line troops will be ""completely reduced by May 23,"" suggesting Russia could soon have aerial superiority and Ukraine could lose the ability to amass ground forces in a counteroffensive.  The documents also underscore lingering problems with Russia's own military offensive, predicting that the result will be a stalemate between the two sides for the foreseeable future. Officials familiar with the situation tell CNN the documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing deck prepared for the Pentagon's senior leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.  The leaking of the documents — many of which are marked top secret — represents a major national security breach, and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security.  In addition to the assessment of the Ukraine war, the documents include intelligence gathered on allies and adversaries alike. Here are the latest headlines:  UN says nearly 8,500 civilian deaths confirmed in Ukraine since invasion: The  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine. between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration. 
            Ukraine's top national security official downplays leaked intelligence documents: Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to Oleksii Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council. ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod, of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov.
            Americans detained by Russia: Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with the parents of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal correspondent detained in Russia, Tuesday. It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist.
            Russia conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile: Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense. The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the defense ministry reports.  ##Catch Up## Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the defense ministry reports.  ""On April 11, 2023, a Strategic Missile Forces combat crew conducted a successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Kapustin Yar state central joint forces test range in the Astrakhan region,"" the statement said. The launch helped confirm the correctness of schematic and structural and technical solutions used in developing new strategic missile systems the defense ministry said. The missile's test warhead hit the target at the Sary Shagan firing range (Republic of Kazakhstan) with the target accuracy, according to the statement.  “The objectives of the launch were fulfilled in full,"" the statement read.  Back in February, Russia carried out a test of an ICBM that appears to have failed around the time President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that ""such testing is routine."" Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. CNN's Oren Liebermann and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia’s failure to grant consular access to wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich “puts it, once again, in violation of international commitments it’s made."" “I think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access, never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes, is going to do even more damage to Russia's standing around the world — a standing that has been in free-fall, particularly since its rei-nvasion of Ukraine last year,” Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. “I think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there, lest they be arbitrarily detained,” he said. Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist. Blinken did say what measures are being taken  to free Gershkovich, only saying that the US is “engaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan’s release.” There was no physical damage to Canadian energy infrastructure after leaked US intelligence documents appeared to show that Russian hackers were attempting to cause damage to pipelines earlier this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Tuesday. “In regards to the reports of cyberattacks against Canadian energy infrastructure, I can confirm that there was no physical damage to any Canadian energy infrastructure following cyberattacks,” Trudeau said. Trudeau is hosting Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, in Toronto for an official visit where Canada announced more military and humanitarian aid for the country.  Trudeau also confirmed that his government website was down after a denial of service attack Tuesday morning. The website appeared to be functioning normally by 2:30 p.m. ET after being down for several hours.  “It’s not uncommon for Russian hackers to target countries as they are showing their steadfast support for Ukraine as they are welcoming Ukrainian delegations or leadership to visit, so the timing isn't surprising,” said Trudeau during a news conference alongside his Ukrainian counterpart, adding that “Russia being able to bring down an official government of Canada webpage for a few hours is in no way going to dissuade us from our unshakable support of Ukraine."" In February, Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which oversees Canada’s foreign intelligence and cybersecurity, issued an alert warning.  “Canadian organizations (need) to be vigilant and prepared for potential malicious cyber activity following the one-year mark of Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Cyber Centre would like to specifically warn Canadian organizations and critical infrastructure  operators to be prepared for the possible disruption, defacement, and attempted exploitation of Canadian network assets by cyber threat actors aligned with Russian interests,” the statement reads. CSE said it would not confirm or deny any specific cyberattacks for security reasons. Canada pledged another $2.4 billion (CDN) loan to Ukraine to support essential services, such as pension payments, purchasing fuel and restoring damaged energy infrastructure. This funding will be distributed through an IMF facility and brings Canada’s total contribution in this regard to about $8 billion (CDN). Canada also signed a major nuclear supply contract to provide for Ukraine’s uranium needs to fuel its nuclear generators until 2035. ##Pentagon Docs## The United States has “engaged with allies and partners at high levels” in the days since the leak of classified documents came to light “to reassure them about our own committed to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Blinken noted that he had spoken Tuesday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and emphasized: “our enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty, its independence, reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries.” The top US diplomat said he would not comment specifically on the “purported documents” when asked about a report that documents showed Ukraine had engaged in attacks outside of its territory. However, Blinken noted that “Ukraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that's been seized from it.” “We give our advice as appropriate. We provide the support, that is well known, but Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory,” he said. The leak of classified Pentagon documents is being taken very seriously, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday. “I can't say much more while the Justice Department's investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously,” Austin said in his first public remarks about the leak. “And we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.”  Austin added that the Defense Department will “turn over every rock until we find the source” of the leaked intelligence documents.  “They were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don’t know, we simply don’t know at this point,” he said during a news conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior Philippine officials.  Austin said the documents they are aware of are dating February 28 and March 1, and that they do not know if there are “other documents” that had been posted.  “Again,” he said, “we will continue to investigate in and try to determine the full scope of the activity.” Austin said that he was first briefed on the “unauthorized disclosure” of documents on April 6 and has been convening senior leaders daily since then. More background: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. CNN’s Celine Alkhaldi and Mostafa Salem contributed to this report.  ##Pentagon Docs## The White House says it has no indication Egypt is providing Russia with deadly arms for its war in Ukraine.  A leaked US intelligence document obtained by the Washington Post indicated Egypt’s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia. It said that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West."" ""We've seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council.  Kirby said Egypt remained “a significant security partner” and would remain so. “The United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years,” he said, speaking to reporters on board Air Force One.  The February-dated “top secret document” purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials referencing plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, and to keep the plans a secret, the Washington Post said. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is not able to confirm its authenticity. An Egyptian official, unnamed by state-affiliated media, called the Washington Post report “informational absurdity” and said that Egypt follows a “balanced policy” with all international parties, Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet said. The statement was carried by several Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Kirby refused to confirm the validity of the document and declined to detail any diplomatic conversations between Washington and Cairo.  ##Pentagon Docs## The family of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in Russia, released a statement on Tuesday calling for his release. “We are encouraged that the State Department has officially designated Evan as wrongfully detained. We appreciate President Biden’s call to us today, assuring us that the U.S. government is doing everything in its power to bring him home as quickly as possible,"" the statement said. The statement continued:  ""In addition to being a distinguished journalist, Evan is a beloved son and brother. There is a hole in our hearts and in our family that won’t be filled until we are reunited. We are grateful for the outpouring of support from his colleagues, friends and everyone standing with Evan and advocating for his immediate release.” The United Arab Emirates rejected reports suggesting that Russian intelligence was touting deepened ties with the Emirati government and planned to work against the United States and the United Kingdom, as reported by the Associated Press — citing an apparent intelligence document from the US.  The purported intelligence document which was posted online and viewed by the AP cited research reportedly from March 9 with the title “Russia/UAE: Intelligence Relationship Deepening,” that said US spies caught Russian intelligence officers boasting that they had convinced the UAE to “work together against US and UK intelligence agencies.”  CNN has not seen the document cited by AP, and both have been unable to confirm its authenticity.    “UAE officials have not seen any of the referenced materials, and any purported claims referenced in the Associated Press regarding the FSB enquiries are categorically false,” an official from the UAE told CNN in a statement on Tuesday. “We refute any allegation regarding an agreement to deepen cooperation between the UAE and other countries’ security services against another country,” the official said. “The UAE has deep and distinguished relations with all countries … and is committed to adherence to international law and respect for the sovereignty of states,” the official said.  The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing longstanding norms around the government's communications with the media.

It's their first time speaking since Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. Biden told reporters, before boarding Air Force One, that he planned to speak with Gershkovich's parents. He connected with them aboard the plane as he flew to Northern Ireland, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.  ""The president made it clear that his national security team has been and will remain focused on securing Evan’s release as well as that of Paul Whelan,"" she said, referring to a second American who has been detained in Russia for several years. She said the charges of espionage against Gershkovich were baseless and said ""he should be released immediately."" The apparent leak of US classified information ""has demonstrated a serious level of inaccuracy,"" the UK's Ministry of Defence said Tuesday.  ""Readers should be cautious about taking at face value allegations that have the potential to spread disinformation,"" the ministry said in a brief statement posted on its official Twitter feed.  Ukraine's response: Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said on his Telegram channel Friday that he believes the documents that have been disseminated are inauthentic, have “nothing to do with Ukraine’s real plans” and are based on “a large amount of fictitious information” spread by Russia. But while Ukrainian officials brushed off the leak, Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of it, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. What's in the documents: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. They contain a wide range of highly classified information – providing a rare window into how the US spies on allies and adversaries alike. US allies are doing damage assessments, scrambling to determine whether any of their own sources and methods have been compromised by the leak. “We expect the US to share a damage assessment with us in the coming days, but we cannot wait for their assessment. Right now, we are doing our own,” said an official from a country that is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement with the US, which includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

CNN's Zachary Cohen, Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed to this post. ##Pentagon Docs## The US government investigations into a leak of highly classified Pentagon documents — which includes intelligence on the war in Ukraine — are starting to take shape, with the Pentagon examining how the leak impacts US national security and the Justice Department launching a criminal investigation into who may have been behind the breach. The interagency probe is being led by the Pentagon’s Office of Intelligence and Security, according to three US officials, and could take months to complete. It will chiefly examine whether any sources and methods have been compromised since the documents, many of which are marked ""top secret,"" were posted on a social media platform earlier this year. Milancy Harris, the deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, will be in charge of the effort on the Pentagon side, officials said. The investigation will also try to determine the scope of the leak, since officials do not yet know whether it has been contained or whether there are more classified documents still circulating online. The Pentagon effort is not focused on the source of the leak, one senior Pentagon official said. But the Defense Department will be examining how it distributes highly classified information and whether it needs to change who receives it on a daily basis. “Way too many people have access to very sensitive information,” a senior US official told CNN, noting that “thousands” of people likely saw these documents before they hit the internet. The leaked materials appear to be photos of documents that were crumpled up and wrinkled, as though they had been folded and stuffed in a pocket. While many officials tend to take classified information home, one senior US official said, the fact that the paper was folded up “tells me this person did not have that authority.” Read more about the investigations here.  Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on Tuesday that Russian forces now control much of the embattled eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.  “We are fully concentrated on Bakhmut, continuing to carry out combat missions. In Bakhmut, most of it — that is, more than 80% — is under our control, including the entire administrative center, plants, factories, the city administration,” Prigozhin said. “What is left is part of the multi-story residential areas, where fortification districts were made. There are tunnels under these high-rise buildings.” Ukrainian officials have denied Prigozhin’s claim. ""This statement by Prigozhin is not true,” Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told CNN on Tuesday. “I've just been in touch with the commander of one of the brigades that are defending the city. I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut."" ""Prigozhin needs to show at least some victory in the city, which they have been trying to capture for nine months in a row, so he makes such statements,"" Cherevatyi added.  The Wagner founder has been known to make incorrect claims about his forces’ advance on the ground in Ukraine. Last week, he posted a grainy video raising a flag at dawn, saying Bakhmut had ""been taken,"" despite ongoing fighting in and around the city. His claim was seen as a ""pretty desperate"" attempt, Western officials said. What Western officials are saying: The officials conceded Russia had been able to make some progress in Bakhmut, but added it could be ""measured in meters."" ""The Russians at the moment, despite trying for six months, with huge numbers of personnel and huge numbers of losses, have been unable to take the town, and at the moment have made very, very slow progress,” the officials said at a briefing last Wednesday.  In the video this Tuesday, Prigozhin said Wagner fighters had relinquished control of some areas around Bakhmut to the Russian military.  “We handed over the flanks to the Ministry of Defence. Units of the Ministry of Defence, including the airborne troops, have today taken over both the right and left flanks,” he said. “That is why Zaliznyanskoye, Nikolaevka, and other settlements, which were stormed by units of the Wagner PMC in previous months, are in the area of responsibility of the airborne troops and other units of the Ministry of Defence.” CNN’s Max Foster contributed to this post.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reassured Ukraine of the United States’ support following a leak of classified Pentagon documents, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. During a call on Tuesday, Blinken “reaffirmed the ironclad U.S. support and vehemently rejected any attempts to cast doubt on Ukraine’s capacity to win on the battlefield,” Kuleba wrote Tuesday on Twitter, adding that the US ""remains Ukraine's trustworthy partner.""  The comments come after a number of highly classified Pentagon documents were released online in recent weeks. Some divulge key weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces gear up to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians – and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed reporting to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs## US President Joe Biden told reporters that he planned to speak to the family of jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich during his flight to Northern Ireland today.  The US State Department formally designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia, and Biden said that he tried to speak to Gershkovich’s family on Monday but would attempt again today. “We’re making it real clear that it’s totally illegal what’s happening. And we declared it, so changes the dynamic,” he said. A senior Egyptian official denied that Egypt’s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia, following a report from The Washington Post citing a leaked US intelligence document, Egyptian state-affiliated media said. A leaked US intelligence document obtained by The Washington Post said Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West."" The ""top secret"" document from February contains purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials, according to the newspaper. It referenced plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, with Sisi asking officials to keep the plans a secret, The Washington Post reported.

The unnamed Egyptian official called the report ""informational absurdity"" and said that Egypt follows a ""balanced policy"" with all international parties, according to Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet. The statement was also carried by several other Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Egypt is one of the world’s top recipients of US military aid, receiving $1.3 billion in military financing annually. What Russia says: Russia’s Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the information a ""hoax."" ""It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now. This is how you should treat such publications,"" Peskov said in response to a question from a journalist on the report. CNN has reached out to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. Remember: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. ##Pentagon Docs## A spokesperson for US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN that Schumer has requested a classified briefing for all senators on the leaked classified US documents that appear to contain information about the war in Ukraine. Investigations and impact: The US Justice Department is investigating how the trove of highly sensitive documents ended up on social media sites.  The Defense Department is still reviewing the matter and has taken steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, officials said, which are normally available on any given day to hundreds of people across the government. While the Pentagon has stood up an “interagency effort” to assess the impact of the leak, US officials and close allies already fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Read more about what's believed to be in the documents. ##Pentagon Docs##  The Russian parliament, the State Duma, voted in favor of amendments to a bill that would allow for the electronic delivery of military call-up papers in addition to traditional letters.  The bill passed through its third reading in the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament Tuesday. It now needs to be approved by the upper chamber, the Federation Council, which is scheduled to meet Wednesday. The final step is for the bill to be signed by President Vladimir Putin before it becomes law. The Kremlin said Tuesday the amendments to military conscription legislation are not connected to mobilization, dismissing rumors of a new wave of enlistment in Russia. Asked during a regular call with reporters if the Kremlin is concerned that the proposed law, if passed, would trigger another wave of a mass exodus of Russians, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, ""Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with mobilization; it has to do with military registration.""  ""There is no second wave,"" Peskov said after being pressed further to respond to the rumors of an upcoming second wave of mobilization. The State Duma published the bill on Tuesday. According to the document, electronic summonses for military service will be equated to paper summons. Currently, conscription documents in Russia must be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer. A person will be considered notified even if they have not seen the call-up papers or email and from the moment of receipt of the summons. Those liable for military service will be banned from traveling abroad. Remember: Russia’s ""partial mobilization"" for its war in Ukraine, which was announced in September, resulted in a significant number of citizens fleeing Russia, as CNN previously reported. The Kremlin acknowledged mistakes were made in its military draft process, but maintains there is no discussion of a new wave of mobilization.   Nearly 8,500 civilians are confirmed to have been killed since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a statement Monday. The OHCHR said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022 until April 9, 2023 — with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be “considerably higher,” the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration.  Most confirmed civilian deaths occurred in Ukrainian government-controlled territory that is under attack by Russia, according to the OHCHR, with 3,927 killed in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which have seen some of the bloodiest battles in the war so far. At least 1,894 civilians have been killed in territory occupied by the Russian Federation when the casualties occurred, the OHCHR said.  Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a man on suspicion of treason, state news agency TASS reported Tuesday. He is accused of transferring money to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The man was detained in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia’s southeast, after making “transfers of personal funds for the purchase of weapons, ammunition and uniforms by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the FSB said, according to TASS. He faces a prison sentence of 12 to 20 years and a possible additional fine of up to 500,000 rubles (around $6,000) if found guilty of treason, TASS reported. Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was “not secret at all,"" according to the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council.  ""You can find it in publicly available sources,“ Oleksii Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod of German broadcaster ARD, in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov. ""The data for conducting certain operations, the size of the units, who is involved and in what direction - this information is absolutely secret. If someone thinks he has it, I can only congratulate him. But I don't know where he could have them from,"" he said. “For the other part of the information - if it was indeed secret - the agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom will know exactly where it came from. And why it surfaced at this particular time,"" added Danilov. The start of Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive will be decided by the staff of the Commander-in-Chief at the very last moment, stressed Danilov.  ""If someone believes that we have only one option, it does not correspond to reality. Even three options would not be much,"" Danilov said in the interview. ""Intelligence agencies need to be more vigilant when it comes to classified documents,"" he added.  Some context: Ukraine has had to alter some of its military plans after the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskytold CNN. However, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, has said he believes the documents have “nothing to do with Ukraine’s real plans” and are based on “a large amount of fictitious information” disseminated by Russia. ##Pentagon Docs## Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. ""We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,"" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. ""The Ministry of Defense did come to IK-17 to recruit prisoners to become war criminals like the rest of the Russian military. But Paul and some other prisoners were sequestered within IK-17, not transferred out,"" he said.  ""The prison administration claims that the phones have been out of order from March 30 through to April 9th or 10th. Russia's infrastructure appears so brittle it could be true, or the prison could just be playing silly buggers again,"" David Whelan said. David Whelan said it seemed his brother has become aware of the case of another wrongfully detained American — Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. ""Paul's fear of being left behind a third time was apparently palpable in his conversation with our parents yesterday,"" David Whelan said. ""We have asked our parents to express to Paul that Elizabeth and I can't conceive a scenario where the U.S. government conceded anything to the Kremlin for an American's release that did not include Paul. It would be an unconscionable betrayal."" The Biden administration has urged the Russians to immediately release both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. South Korea has claimed that a ""considerable amount"" of the material leaked from the Pentagon was fabricated, as US officials scramble to contain the effects of the leak. Elsewhere, Ukrainian refugees continue to cross the border into Poland, with 400,000 new arrivals in the past week taking the total number to 11 million since the start of the invasion. Here are the latest headlines: Ukrainian adviser pushes for more weapons: Ukraine needs more long-range weapons and “less contemplation on leaks,” said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, referring to the recent leak of classified Pentagon documents.
            South Korea claims leaked material was fabricated: South Korea's presidential office claims the defense ministers of South Korea and the United States have agreed that a “considerable amount” of information in the leaked Pentagon documents was fabricated, after the leak revealed a conversation among Korean officials on the war in Ukraine. 
            Ukraine PM in Canada: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has arrived in Canada ahead of a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau. In an interview with Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Shmyhal said he would request ammunition and heavily armored vehicles. 
            Refugees continue to flee to Poland: More than 11 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to Poland’s EU representation, with nearly 400,000 people crossing the border in the last week. 
            Kremlin says US journalist broke law: Detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich  ""was caught red-handed and violated the relevant laws of the Russian Federation,"" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday, in response to the US State Department designating him wrongfully detained.
            Long sentence for arson protest in Russia: A military court has sentenced two Russian men to 19 years in jail for setting a fire at a local administration building where a military registration desk was located, state media reported Monday. One of the men said the incident was a protest against the war in Ukraine. ##Catch Up## Detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich violated Russian law, the Kremlin maintained Tuesday, in response to the US State Department having designated him as being wrongfully detained. “The United States could and should protect the rights of its citizen, who was caught red-handed and violated the relevant laws of the Russian Federation. That is what he is suspected of. That is all I can say,” Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists during a regular conference call. Russian investigators formally charged Gershkovich with espionage, Russian state media reported, adding he denied the accusations. A Moscow court on April 18 will hear an appeal filed by Gershkovich’s lawyers against his arrest, Russian state media said citing the court. The correspondent is currently held in the notorious Leftereovo pre-detention center until May 29. What the US is saying: CNN reported on Monday that the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich’s release. CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post.  Ukraine needs more long-range weapons and “less contemplation on leaks,” said Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, referring to the recent leak of classified Pentagon documents. “If we had time, we could watch the RF [the Russian Federation] fall apart & its ‘elites’ devour each other. But we don't have it, as our people are dying,"" tweeted Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on Tuesday  “We need less contemplation on ‘leaks’ and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war and make the RF face the reality.”  Some context: Ukraine has pushed for long range weapons in order to be able to strike ammunition depots and logistics hubs that Russian forces have moved out of range of existing systems. In January, Ukrainian officials asked for longer range missiles that can reach inside Russia. But Western allies have so far been careful not to provide Ukraine with systems that can reach Russia in order to reduce the risk of escalating the conflict. CNN's Tim Lister and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs## A military court has sentenced two Russian men to 19 years in jail for setting a fire at a local administration building where a military registration desk was located, state media reported Monday. On October 11, 2022, Roman Nasryev and Alexey Nuriev threw a Molotov cocktail into the window of the government building in the town of Bakal, in Russia’s Chelyabinsk region, according to investigators cited by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The two men were found guilty of committing “a terrorist act by a group of persons by prior conspiracy” and of “training for carrying out terrorist activities.” Nuriev was reportedly the commander of the fire and rescue service of the Ministry of Emergencies, and Nasryev was a driver for the National Guard (Rosgvardia), local news website 74.ru said. The verdict marks the most severe sentence to date for anti-war arson, according to the human rights group Solidarity Zone, which believes the lengthy sentence could be because both men were working for government institutions. In March, Solidarity Zone reported that Nasryev told the court he “decided to take a similar action, because I did not agree with the mobilization, the ‘special military operation’ and the war in general.” “This way I wanted to convey my position of disagreement, I wanted my voice to be heard,” Nasryev added. Some context: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a ""partial mobilization"" in September 2022, meaning citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription. More recently, Russian officials have consistently denied rumors of a second mobilization. More than 11 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia invaded in February 2022, Poland’s EU representation tweeted on Tuesday.     Around 87% of those crossing the border are woman and children, it added. At the beginning of April, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that just over 10.6 million people had crossed the border.  This means that nearly 400,000 people have travelled from Ukraine to Poland in the last week.  There are currently more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees living in Poland and more than 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees settled in other European countries, the UNHCR reports. ""All those fleeing the war will find shelter and all the help they need in Poland,” Poland’s EU representation added.   Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has arrived in Canada ahead of a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, according to his official Twitter account. Shmyhal said Canada was among the first countries to “stand with Ukraine,” and the two governments are “preparing new agreements and deals to strengthen the macro-financial and economic stability of Ukraine."" In an interview with Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Shmyhal said he would request ammunition and heavily armored vehicles.  “It’s crucially important for the organization of our counteroffensive,"" he told the Globe. South Korea's presidential office claims the defense ministers of South Korea and the United States have agreed that a “considerable amount” of information in the leaked Pentagon documents was fabricated, after the leak revealed a conversation among Korean officials on the war in Ukraine. ""On the US government’s alleged wiretapping, the defense ministers of the two countries agreed that ‘a considerable amount of the documents were fabricated,’” the presidential office said in a statement without providing further details.  The statement did not specify whether they believe that only the parts about South Korea is fabricated, or the documents in general.  CNN has asked the presidential office why they believe some of the information has been fabricated. CNN cannot independently confirm if any of the documents have been altered or fabricated. The leaked conversation: The leaked documents described a conversation between two senior South Korean national security officials over a US request for ammunition.   The officials worried that supplying the ammunition, which the US would then send to Ukraine, would violate South Korea’s policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war. According to the document, one of the officials then suggested a way of getting around the policy without actually changing it – by selling the ammunition to Poland. In previous CNN reporting, a US official said the leaked documents ""look real."" Seoul's response: South Korea said its Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup had held a phone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning, at Austin's request. On the call, Austin explained recent media coverage of the leak and said the US would ""closely communicate and fully cooperate"" with Seoul on this issue, according to South Korea’s Defense Ministry. CNN has not a received a readout of the call from the office of the US Secretary of Defense. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense for comment, and for a readout of the call, but has not yet received a response. Here's what we know about the leak. ##Pentagon Docs## In his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky celebrated the release of some Ukrainian prisoners of war, vowing to ""return everyone."" Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners in their latest swap, with 80 men and 20 women returning to Ukraine.  ""These are a hundred families who got real joy on the eve of Easter. And, of course, we keep working to return all our people from Russian captivity,"" Zelensky said. ""We remember everyone! And we will return everyone!"" Diplomatic efforts: He also outlined ongoing foreign policy and diplomacy efforts; on Monday, he met prominent British entrepreneur Richard Branson, spoke with the Greek prime minister and struck an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister. Zelensky added that Germany continues to provide defense assistance, including armored vehicles, ammunition, medicine and more. Boosting Ukraine's defense capabilities ""protects everyone in the partner countries, everyone in Europe, everyone in the world,"" he added. ""The term 'defeat' should become a companion to the term 'aggressor', and it is only the Ukrainian victory that will ensure this,"" Zelensky said.  Russia is using ""scorched Earth"" tactics as it tries to take the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine's top land commander. Across the country's east, Ukraine is continuing to repel Russian attacks, the military says.  A prisoner swap saw 200 servicemen exchanged; meanwhile, the fallout from the Pentagon leak of classified documents continues, with the Kremlin denying any involvement. Here are the latest headlines: Russia devastating Bakhmut: Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy Bakhmut, in what one commander has called ""scorched Earth"" tactics. Meanwhile, Ukraine is working to repel Russian forces in the country's east, with more than 20 attacks repelled within 24 hours, according to Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces.
            Detained reporter: The US State Department officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was ""wrongfully detained."" Gershkovich is being held in Russia, and this designation will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.
            Prisoner swap: Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners of war in their latest swap. Moscow's Defense Ministry said it received 106 Russian servicemen, while Ukraine's presidential office head said 100 Ukrainians were returned home — including troops who had fought to defend Mariupol, Hostomel and Azovstal.
            Ukraine on the Pentagon leak: A Ukrainian Defense Ministry representative on intelligence accused Russia of using altered versions of the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online to spread disinformation. ""In recent decades, Russia's most successful intelligence operations have been carried out in Photoshop,"" said Andrii Yusov.
            Moscow's response: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed accusations that Moscow may have been involved in the leak. “The tendency to always blame Russia for everything and blame everything on Russia is now a common disease,” he said. ##Catch Up## The recent leak of classified US military documents, if authentic, could have deadly consequences for the Ukrainians in the war with Russia, said the top Democrat on the US House intelligence committee.  “It won’t be hard for the Russians to cut off [intelligence] collection avenues that might have been saving lives every day,” Rep. Jim Himes said on Monday.   “Anything that points to sources and methods carries the very real risk that those sources and methods go away,” Himes said. “And that can mean people being killed, that can mean technologies being shut down. And that translates into bad outcomes on the battlefield.”  Himes emphasized that he had not been briefed on the documents and could not independently corroborate their authenticity. But US officials have told CNN that the documents appear real. The fallout: US allies are doing damage assessments, scrambling to determine whether any of their own sources and methods have been compromised by the leak.  Himes said he worried that the closest of US allies — the so-called ""Five Eyes"" intelligence partnership that includes Australia Canada, New Zealand and the UK — “might think twice about sharing their most sensitive intelligence” because of the leak. The leak has also led the Pentagon to take steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, US officials have said. ##Pentagon Docs## Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who is being held in Russia, has been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department.   “Today, Secretary Blinken made a determination that Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained by Russia,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement Monday. The designation underscores the United States government’s statements that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless, and it will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.  Gershkovich’s case will now be handled at the State Department through the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.   Both of the Americans who have been recently brought home from Russia — Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner — had been designated as wrongfully detained, and were freed in prisoner swaps.  Paul Whelan, who remains imprisoned in Russia, also has been declared wrongfully detained.  In his statement, Patel said the “U.S. government will provide all appropriate support to Mr. Gershkovich and his family.” “We call for the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr. Gershkovich,” he said. “We also call on Russia to release wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.” US State Department Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has been tapped to lead the diplomatic response to the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, according to a US official familiar with the matter. US government officials “are engaging with allies and partners at high levels over this including to reassure them of our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and the fidelity of securing our partnerships” following the mass leak of highly classified documents, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Monday. Patel would not go into details about which countries they had engaged, saying “that work is ongoing.” Asked by CNN if the State Department is taking the lead on those conversation, Patel said that “as the main diplomatic branch and agency of this administration, of course the Department of State would have a role in communicating with our allies and partners, but these conversations are happening across the administration.” “US officials are engaging with allies and partners at the highest level over this,” he said.  Patel would not say if any steps had been taken to restrict access to classified information at the State Department as a result of the leak, saying he did not want to discuss policy decisions.  CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  International response: Patel would not speak on specific comments from South Korean and Israeli officials reacting to leaked documents. South Korea’s presidential office said it will hold “necessary discussions with the US” regarding the document leak, which comes as the relationship between Seoul and Washington is already strained due to South Korean anger over the Inflation Reduction Act harming South Korea’s electronic vehicle industry and concerns related to the US CHIPS Act.  “There is a lot of frustration towards the Yoon administration for being too committed to the US alliance so every aspect of the US-South Korea relationship is under the microscope,” said a former US Ambassador to South Korea.   The South Korean president is scheduled to visit the White House later this month, making the timing around this incident particularly unfortunate the former diplomat said.   “Does Yoon have to raise this during the State Visit? We don’t know yet,” the diplomat said More broadly, one diplomat from a NATO country told CNN that they do not believe Moscow was overly surprised by the most of the intel that was revealed in the leaked documents, noting Russia has robust intelligence gathering operations.  They also said that they were not frustrated that there was US intelligence that was not widely shared with allies. This diplomat said most nations do not share everything with their allies nor is there an expectation that they do so.  “That’s not the way it works,” the diplomat said. ##Pentagon Docs## The Pentagon is still working to determine the scale of a leak of classified information that has occurred in recent weeks, Chris Meagher, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said Monday.  CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  “The Department of Defense is working around the clock to look at the scope and scale of the distribution, the assessed impact, and our mitigation measures,” Meagher said. “We're still investigating how this happened, as well as the scope of the issue. There have been steps to take a closer look at how this type of information is distributed and to whom. We’re also still trying to assess what might be out there.”  Meagher said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was first briefed on the leak on April 6 and began “convening senior leaders on a daily basis” the next day.  Over the weekend, US officials engaged with allies and partners — some of whom were also implicated in the document leak, Meagher said.  The Pentagon team is also working to determine if the leak of classified material includes the Defense Department’s legislative affairs, public affairs, policy, general counsel, intelligence and security, and joint staff offices, Meagher said.  Meagher said the team is a “coordinated effort amongst several different components of DOD” who were all working to “get our arms around everything that has to do with” the leak. Meagher declined to say who specifically was in charge of that team and overseeing those efforts. ##Pentagon Docs##

                      A senior Egyptian official denied that the country's military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia, following reporting by the Washington Post citing a leaked US intelligence document, Egyptian state-affiliated media said. A leaked US intelligence document obtained by the Washington Post said Egypt's President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret ""to avoid problems with the West."" The February-dated ""top secret document"" purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials referencing plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, and to keep the plans a secret, the Washington Post said. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is unable to confirm its authenticity. The Egyptian official, unnamed by state-affiliated media, called the Washington Post report ""informational absurdity"" and said that Egypt follows a ""balanced policy"" with all international parties, Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet said. The statement was carried by several Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Egypt is one of the world's top recipients of US military aid, receiving $1.3 billion in military financing annually. The White House also said it has no indication Egypt is providing Russia with deadly arms.  John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council, told reporters aboard Air Force One ""we've seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia.""  Kirby said Egypt remained ""a significant security partner"" and would remain so. ""The United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years,"" he said.  Russia's Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the information ""another hoax."" ""It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now. This is how you should treat such publications,"" Peskov said in response to a question from a reporter on the report. CNN reached out to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry for comment. Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. Egypt has publicly voiced muted opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It has supported United Nations resolutions condemning the war, including a call in February that Moscow ""immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine and called for a cessation of hostilities."" The country's economy has been damaged by the conflict, with Egypt relying heavily on grain exports from the two countries.

                      It's been one month since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, triggering alarms throughout the halls of global finance. The initial panic has settled into a more tolerable state of tension. We can all take a deep breath, knowing our money is safe and that banks have the tools they need, courtesy of the federal government, to weather the storm.  ""We're going from flashing red lights to flashing yellow lights,"" Wells Fargo's senior bank analyst Mike Mayo told me recently. ""I think it's time for hyper awareness and vigilance to anything else"" that might further undermine confidence.  Regulators and investors are certainly on high alert. And they don't have to look too far to find things to worry about. Here's the deal: SVB's red flags — its breakneck growth, lax risk management, and over-reliance on uninsured deposits, among other things — should have been easy to spot before its collapse. Now, everyone's looking for the next risk hiding in plain sight.  A consensus is forming around three key areas that analysts fear could create a systemic problem — commercial real estate, underwater bond portfolios, and the industry with the most metal moniker ever, shadow banks.  The toll of the WFH era  Commercial real estate — offices, apartment complexes, warehouses and malls — has come under substantial pressure, my colleague Julia Horowitz reports. Commercial property valuations could fall by roughly 20% to 25% this year, according to Rich Hill, head of real estate strategy at Cohen & Steers. For offices, declines could be even steeper, topping 30%. Office properties are a particular pain point here. The average occupancy of offices in the United States is still less than half their March 2020 levels, according to data from security provider Kastle. About $270 billion in commercial real estate loans held by banks will come due in 2023. Nearly a third of that, $80 billion, is on office properties. Signs of strain are increasing. The proportion of commercial office mortgages where borrowers are behind with payments is rising, according to Trepp, which provides data on commercial real estate, and high-profile defaults are making headlines. Earlier this year, a landlord owned by asset manager PIMCO defaulted on nearly $2 billion in debt for seven office buildings in San Francisco; New York City; Boston and Jersey City, New Jersey. This is a potential problem for banks, given their extensive lending to the sector. Goldman Sachs estimates that 55% of US office loans sit on bank balance sheets. Regional and community banks — already under pressure after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March — account for 23% of the total. ""I'm more concerned than I've been in a long time,"" said Matt Anderson, managing director at Trepp. Unrealized losses Back when interest rates were near zero, US banks gobbled up long-dated Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. (And, typically, that's a safe move if you make sure to hedge against the risk of those assets losing value — which SVB did not.)  But as the Fed and other central banks have raised interest rates aggressively, the value of those bonds has been eroded.  US banks are now sitting on an estimated $620 billion in unrealized losses — their assets are worth less now than they paid for them, making it a problem if the bank is forced to sell those assets in a crisis (like, say, a bank run). That $620 billion is a conservative estimate, experts say. And it remains unclear where those unrealized losses loom — whether they are spread out across the sector or concentrated among certain kinds of lenders.  Shadow banks As we discussed here last week, shadow banking refers to financial institutions that lend out money (like a bank) but don't take deposits from customers.  They're a large and diverse cast that includes investment banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, private equity funds, all manner of Wall Street power players.  The menacing nickname can be interpreted widely. They're in the shadows because they're unregulated, sure. But are they, like shady? Yes and no. Hedge funds and private equity types get a bad rap that is sometimes deserved, but they also provide financing to young firms that can't get the time of day from regular bank-banks.  The key thing to remember is they're not subject to the same strict rules as banks are, meaning they can take on more risk. They also don't get the benefit of a government backstop if the wheels start to come off.  But bank-banks and non-banks overlap in all kinds of real and perceived ways, and when confidence is eroded on either side, that creates a potential for panic to spread.  The mere perception that the banking sector might be connected to a struggling non-bank could spark a broader financial crisis, as my colleague Anna Cooban explains.  Bottom line One of the many troubling reminders to emerge from the SVB debacle is that banks are big, sprawling operations run by human beings, in service of other human beings, none of whom are entirely rational. That might seem simplistic, but it's especially relevant for an industry as uniquely reliant on trust as banking is.  ""This is not a zero-defect industry,"" Mayo says. ""This is an industry that tries to minimize losses of mistakes, just like any other industry...The reality is that there are going to be mistakes."" He added: ""This is a time when banks can reinforce the importance of their most important asset, which is trust.""  Enjoying Nightcap?

                      Juul settles lawsuit with West Virginia for $7.9 million

                      West Virginia has settled a lawsuit with e-cigarette maker Juul Labs for a total of $7.9 million, the state's attorney general announced Monday. The company was accused of unfair, deceptive acts or practices in the advertising and marketing of Juul products in the state, specifically targeting teenagers. The lawsuit claimed Juul targeted these users through social media, influencer marketing and fashion bloggers and celebrities popular with teenagers.  ""This settlement puts companies like Juul in check to not copy big tobacco's playbook and gear marketing strategies toward underage people,"" West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said.  Morrisey said the court alleged Juul had ""deceived consumers about its nicotine strength, misrepresented the nicotine equivalency of its products to traditional cigarettes and understated the risks of addiction that occur with such powerful levels of nicotine."" The AG said 14.3% of West Virginia high schoolers used e-cigarettes at least once in the past 30 days, higher than the national average of 13.2%.  In a statement, a Juul company spokesperson said the settlement is ""another step in its ongoing commitment to resolve issues from the company's past."" Juul said terms of the agreement will go to ""financial resources to further combat underage use and develop cessation programs"" and is part of the current business practices implemented in 2019. ""With West Virginia having the highest cigarette-smoking rate in the U.S., we hope that some funds will go directly to interventions to reduce the use of combustible cigarettes and improve public health in the state,"" the company said. ""Juul Labs remains focused on... its mission to transition adult smokers away from cigarettes -- the number one cause of preventable death."" Last December, Juul Labs announced it settled more than 5,000 cases brought by approximately 10,000 plaintiffs in the US, resolving a substantial amount of legal issues for the company. The company said the cases were variously personal injury, consumer class action, or from government entity and Native American tribe groups, but did not disclose the settlement amount.  That followed a September announcement that Juul would pay $438.5 million to 34 states and territories after a two-year investigation into its marketing and sales practices -- like in West Virginia, Juul was charged with deliberately marketing its products to young people. At one point, Juul was selling some of the most popular vapes in the US, especially the flavored products which the company stopped selling in 2019.  Last summer, the FDA ordered Juul products to be removed from the US market. A court temporarily blocked the FDA ban, so products are still for sale in the United States.

                      Elon Musk's weekend antics could only further crumble Twitter's brand value

                      Under Elon Musk, Twitter has antagonized multiple major news organizations by labeling them state-funded media, appears to have eased restrictions on Russian government accounts and made crude jokes on the front of its headquarters and on Musk's own Twitter display name.  And that's just this weekend.  Musk's antics, which only seem to have escalated this month, threaten to further erode Twitter's brand value. For months, the company has struggled to retain advertisers and supplement its declining ad business — which previously comprised 90% of its annual revenue — by convincing users to pay up for its Twitter Blue subscription service.  Musk, who is on the hook for large payments to lenders after buying the company for $44 billion, including with significant debt, must either coax hesitant advertisers back to the platform or boost its subscription business -— or both. But his recent erratic moves may only complicate those turnaround efforts.   Late last week, Twitter faced backlash for labeling NPR as a ""state-affiliated media"" organization akin to foreign propaganda outlets such as Russia's RT and Sputnik, in an apparent violation of its own policies. NPR CEO John Lansing called Twitter's move ""unacceptable,"" and said the organization is ""supported by millions of listeners.""  Following the pushback, Twitter changed NPR's label to ""government funded media,"" and applied the same designation to British broadcaster BBC over the weekend. Twitter has not given a definition for what it considers ""government funded media,"" but the BBC pushed back on the label, saying it is independent and ""funded by the British public through the license fee.""  The moves risk alienating some of the best-known media organizations in the world and undermining what has long been a key selling point for the platform: its role as a central hub for news. NPR, in particular, has not tweeted from its main account in nearly a week.   While Twitter labeled some news accounts as state-funded, it also appears to have removed some restrictions on Russian government accounts that had been put in place following the outset of Russia's war in Ukraine, again prompting outrage among some users.  Musk commented on the decision in a tweet Sunday saying: ""I'm told Putin called me a war criminal for helping Ukraine, so he's not exactly my best friend. All news is to some degree propaganda. Let people decide for themselves.""  Twitter, which laid off much of its media relations team last year, did not respond to a request for comment.   The controversial moves come as Twitter continues to face significant business challenges. Analysis firm Similarweb last week reported that traffic to Twitter's ad portal was down nearly 19% year-over-year in March. Many major advertisers have halted spending on Twitter since Musk's takeover over concerns about increased hate speech on the platform and massive cuts to the company's workforce.   Musk has said Twitter is working to improve the platform's ad targeting to increase value for advertisers. ""But all the while there have been distractions,"" said Scott Kessler, technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, adding that there are ""significant questions about the direction that the company is going."" At the same time, online ad spending broadly has contracted over concerns about the economy.  Against that backdrop, Musk's Twitter has made several head-scratching announcements this month, some of which might only add to its challenges.  Musk previously frustrated some of Twitter's celebrity users, who have long been a key selling point for the platform, with a promise to remove blue checkmarks from accounts who had been verified under Twitter's previous system. But it didn't exactly go to plan — instead of removing checks from all previously verified users, Twitter appeared to target a single account belonging to the New York Times.  Days later, Twitter's home button was temporarily replaced with doge, the meme representing the cryptocurrency dogecoin, which Musk has promoted. The company also briefly restricted Twitter users from sharing links to a rival platform, upsetting users, including one who had previously reported the so-called Twitter files using documents provided by Musk.  As if to underscore his unique and questionable impact on the brand, the ""Chief Twit"" has also apparently been keeping busy with changes to Twitter's San Francisco headquarters. Last week, photos began spreading of a piece of plastic covering the ""w"" in the sign on the front of the company's office.   At nearly midnight on Sunday, Musk tweeted that the company's landlord ""says we're legally required to keep sign as Twitter & cannot remove 'w,' so we painted it background color,"" alongside a photo of the ""w"" painted white against a white background, leaving a more asinine word in its place. ""Problem solved!"" Musk tweeted.   If only the same could be said for the platform's business troubles.

                      Democratic lawmakers sent letters to 14 of the largest depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, seeking details about the lender's ""unusually cozy"" relationships with its well-heeled clients.  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sent the letters Sunday to executives at Roku, Roblox, Circle and BlockFi, among others, raising questions about their ""white glove"" treatment by SVB. Silicon Valley Bank was known to cater to the tech startup world. But Warren and Ocasio-Cortez, citing media reports, raised concerns about whether the bank's relationships went beyond industry standards and potentially hastened its collapse last month.  SVB reportedly provided lower-interest-rate mortgages for tech start-up founders whom other banks wouldn't lend to, according to the New York Times, while sponsoring industry ski trips, conferences, and fancy dinners, the lawmakers wrote. ""Silicon Valley Bank's unusually cozy relationship with its clients increased the threat of contagion when the bank went under,"" said Senator Warren in a statement. ""The American people deserve to know how these mutual backscratching arrangements developed, who benefited from them, and what role they played in Silicon Valley Bank's failure."" SVB became the second-largest bank failure in US history a month ago. State and federal regulators stepped in to shut the bank down a day after panicked depositors yanked their funds, drawing down $42 billion in the span of a single day.  The vast majority of the bank's deposits were uninsured, which makes the bank more vulnerable to a run. Depositors with less than $250,000 limit set by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are far less likely to draw down their money at the first sign of trouble.

                      Tupperware shares fell nearly 50% Monday following a bleak warning that its future is looking murky. In a regulatory filing late Friday, the container maker said there's ""substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern,"" and that it's working with financial advisers to find financing to stay afloat. Tupperware said it won't have enough cash to fund its operations if it doesn't secure additional money. The company said it is exploring potential layoffs, and it's reviewing its real estate portfolio for potential money-saving efforts.  The New York Stock Exchange also warned that Tupperware's stock is in danger of being de-listed for not filing a required annual report. ""Tupperware has embarked on a journey to turn around our operations and today marks a critical step in addressing our capital and liquidity position,"" CEO Miguel Fernandez said in a press release. ""The company is doing everything in its power to mitigate the impacts of recent events, and we are taking immediate action to seek additional financing and address our financial position.""  The 77-year-old business has been struggling in recent years to maintain its relevance against rivals. It has been trying to shed its staid image and attract younger customers with newer and trendier products. It also struck a deal with Target last year to sell its products.  Several issues are hurting Tupperware, including a ""sharp decline in the number of sellers, a consumer pullback on home products, and a brand that still does not fully connect with younger consumers,"" according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. Saunders said Tupperware is in a ""precarious position"" financially because it's struggling to grow sales, and because it's asset-light it doesn't have ""much capacity to raise money."" ""The company used to be a hotbed of innovation with problem-solving kitchen gadgets, but it has really lost its edge,"" he said.  Tupperware said the entry into Target is part of the brand's reinvention, which includes plans to grow the business through multiple retail channels and get its products in front of younger consumers who've never even heard of Tupperware parties. But that has failed to work so far: Shares are down 90% over the past year. It also issued another ""going concern"" warning last November.

                      US consumers are starting to feel that credit is getting harder to come by, according to survey results released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Consumer perceptions of credit access and availability declined in March, with the share of respondents reporting it's harder to obtain credit than one year ago climbing to the highest since the New York Fed started conducting its Survey of Consumer Expectations in 2013. In March, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank roiled the banking sector, escalating fears of a credit crisis. While action taken by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department appears to have allayed concerns of further collapses, economists anticipate that a further tightening of credit standards may follow, further pressuring businesses and consumers in this environment of high interest rates and moderating inflation. For the first time since October, US consumers' year-ahead inflation expectations increased. Near-term inflation expectations increased 0.52 percentage points to 4.7%, according to the New York Fed's March 2023 Survey of Consumer Expectations. It's the largest jump in one-year inflation expectations since March of last year. Consumers' uncertainty about future inflation outcomes also increased for the one-year horizon. However, longer-term inflation expectations decreased when looking three and five years out, according to the report. The Fed closely watches measurements of inflation expectations. If those expectations are higher, the concern is that it could lead to more workers bargaining for higher wages to counteract losses in purchasing power and businesses passing along higher expenses in the form of price increases. Looking beyond inflation, consumers' expectations of higher unemployment increased by 1.3 percentage point to 40.7%, driven by consumers between the ages of 40 and 60 years old and those with household incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 a year. Still, the mean perceived probability of losing a job declined, and fewer people anticipated they would leave their job.

                      Parents invest so much of themselves, emotionally and financially, in raising their children — but the time comes when a parent has to stop subsidizing their adult children's everyday expenses. Think housing, health insurance, car payments, cell phones, credit cards, subscription services, student loans and travel.  And, as it turns out, kids and parents don't agree on just when exactly that time should be.  A new survey from Bankrate found that Gen Z adults (between the ages of 18 and 26) think parents should slow their roll on when to stop paying for them. Take housing. Gen Z adults said they shouldn't have to start paying rent until age 23 on average. Baby Boomer and Gen X parents beg to differ, saying their kids should pony up starting at age 21. When it comes to cell phones and credit card bills, Gen Z thinks they should start paying for them by age 21. Their parents say age 19 would be better.  The Bankrate survey doesn't specify how many respondents are living with their parents or, conversely, their adult children. But it's a fair bet the percentage could be significant. In July 2022, the Pew Research Center found that half of adults ages 18 to 29 were living with at least one parent. The risk for parents of subsidizing adult children Of course, how a parent feels about the need for their child to pay their own bills and what a parent does may be two very different things. Nearly 7 in 10 parents with children 18 or older said they have made a financial sacrifice to help their grown-up kids, according to the survey. Thirty-one percent characterized that sacrifice as ""significant,"" while 37% said it was ""somewhat significant."" Sacrifice meant: Reducing their emergency savings (51%), impairing their ability to pay off their own debt (49%) or save for retirement (43%); and making it hard to reach some other financial milestone (55%). Low-income parents — defined as those making $50,000 or less a year — were most likely to say they have made financial sacrifices to help their adult children.  For instance, 58% of the lowest earners said they sacrificed their emergency savings compared to 46% of the highest earning households — defined as earning $100,000 or more a year. While it can be hard to say no to your adult offspring if they ask for, or simply expect, a financial assist, parents do themselves no favors if they subsidize them at the expense of their own financial security.  After all, not everyone is likely to backstop a parent who falls behind on housing payments, fails to create a sufficient financial cushion for retirement or who finds they can't afford medical care. ""Make sure the assistance [you give] works within your budget and be clear about the parameters,"" said Ted Rossman, a senior analyst at Bankrate. ""Helping out shouldn't be seen as a blank check or an indefinite handout. It might help to attach a specific dollar amount or time frame."" Bankrate's survey, conducted from March 14 to March 16, included responses from a nationally representative sampling of 2,346 US adults, of whom 773 were parents with children age 18 or older.

                      The James Webb Space Telescope has spied colorful, never-before-seen details in one of the most well-observed remnants of an exploded star. The glowing gas and dust of Cassiopeia A is all that remains of a star that exploded in a supernova, and its light reached Earth for the first time 340 years ago. It's the youngest known supernova remnant in our galaxy, which is why the celestial object has been studied by a multitude of ground and space-based telescopes.  Cassiopeia A is located 11,000 light-years away in the Cassiopeia constellation, and the remnant stretches for 10 light-years. Insights from Cas A, as the remnant is also known, allow scientists to learn more about how stellar explosions occur.  Astronomers turned the Webb telescope and its instruments in the direction of Cas A to see if the observatory's infrared capabilities could pick up anything other telescopes have missed. Infrared light is invisible to the human eye, allowing Webb to spy otherwise invisible aspects of the universe. ""Cas A represents our best opportunity to look at the debris field of an exploded star and run a kind of stellar autopsy to understand what type of star was there beforehand and how that star exploded,"" said Danny Milisavljevic, assistant professor at Purdue University and principal investigator of the Webb program that captured the new observations, in a statement. ""Compared to previous infrared images, we see incredible detail that we haven't been able to access before,"" said co-investigator Tea Temim, research astronomer at Princeton University, in a statement. Webb's new infrared image of Cas A has been translated into visible light so the human eye can see the remnant's colors. Red and orange light on the remnant's exterior indicates warm dust, where material ejected from the star before it exploded is colliding with surrounding gas and dust. Inside the bubble-like structure of the remnant, bright pink light can be seen, along with features that resemble clumps and knots. This material came from the exploded star and includes glowing heavy elements like argon, neon and oxygen. A bright green loop along the right side of the bubble has also captured the interest of researchers. ""We've nicknamed it the Green Monster in honor of Fenway Park in Boston. If you look closely, you'll notice that it's pockmarked with what look like mini-bubbles,"" said Milisavljevic. ""The shape and complexity are unexpected and challenging to understand."" The team is still trying to understand the sources behind all of the different colors in the image. Studying remnants like Cas A can help scientists understand cosmic dust, a building block for stars and planets, and how exploded stars release elements crucial for life. ""By understanding the process of exploding stars, we're reading our own origin story,"" Milisavljevic said. ""I'm going to spend the rest of my career trying to understand what's in this data set.""

                      South Korea said on Tuesday that information contained in the leaked classified Pentagon documents that appeared to be based on sensitive conversations between top South Korean security officials is ""fabricated,"" without providing further details.  The documents have become a domestic issue in South Korea amid accusations they expose the extent of United States eavesdropping on key regional allies.  The fallout comes as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is scheduled to make an official state visit to the US on April 26 where he will be hosted by US President Joe Biden. The two countries will celebrate the 70th anniversary of their joint security alliance during the visit. One document released in the leak suggests South Korean officials were concerned ammunition sold to the US could be diverted to Ukraine, potentially violating the country's policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries engaged in conflict.  Another document cites information relating to South Korea as coming from a ""signals intelligence report,"" or intelligence gathered through the interception of communication signals. In a statement, the office of South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said allegations the US had penetrated the country's official communication channels were ""an absurd false suspicion.""  The statement said South Korean defense chief Lee Jong-sup held phone talks with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin Tuesday morning, during which they agreed that ""a considerable amount of the documents were fabricated.""  The statement did not specify whether the two sides believe that only the parts about South Korea are fabricated, or the documents in general.  South Korea's Defense Ministry said the call took place at the request of Austin. During the call, the US Secretary of Defense explained recent media coverage of the leak and said the US would closely communicate with South Korea on this issue, according to the statement. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense for comment, and for a readout of the call. A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that the call happened but would not offer any additional details, saying only that a US readout would be released soon.   CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents.  Asked about the validity of the documents, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told reporters at a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, ""we know that some of them have been doctored,"" but that he didn't want to ""speak to the validity of all the documents."" ""We're still working through the validity of all the documents that we know are out there,"" Kirby said. Pressed on if the US believes that some of the documents are valid, Kirby said the administration ""cannot speak to the veracity and the validity of any of those documents at this point."" Kirby added later there was, ""no excuse for these kinds of documents to be in the public domain. They don't deserve to be in the public domain. They deserve to be protected. So, we're going to get to the bottom of this,"" but he said, ""we need to be careful speculating right now."" 'Absurd false suspicion' The revelations have led South Korean opposition lawmakers to suggest the US had wiretapped the South Korean presidential office, which had moved from the Blue House to the Yongsan Presidential Office in Seoul last May.  The claims of wiretapping were denied by the South Korean presidential office. ""We clearly state that the suspicion of wiretapping the Yongsan Presidential Office is an absurd false suspicion,"" the statement said.  ""Unlike the Blue House where the president's office, secretary's office and security office were scattered, currently we are maintaining 'iron security' through an integrated security system and dedicated personnel,"" the statement added. South Korea is a major arms exporter and President Yoon announced last year plans to become one of the world's top four weapons suppliers. In July, the country signed a deal to supply Poland with almost 1,000 K2 tanks, more than 600 pieces of artillery and dozens of fighter jets. And in November, a US defense official told CNN that Washington intends to buy 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition from South Korean arms manufacturers to provide to Ukraine. On Monday, the presidential office said South Korea's policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war remains unchanged.

                      ""Today was a powerful day and a testament to people power,"" reinstated Rep. Justin Jones said Monday. Jones, along with former Rep. Justin Pearson, was expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on Thursday after the two of them and fellow Democrat, Rep. Gloria Johnson, staged a demonstration on the floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. On Monday, he returned to the legislature after a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council. Tennessee law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held. Jones said being expelled and reinstated made him understand that ""we need more representatives who are willing to risk a title to be with the people, to stand with the people. We need bold leadership.""  Now that he's back in office, Jones was told he can file 15 bills – as he's now technically a new member – which he said he plans to do by the end of the week. “Every one of those bills are going to have to do with common sense guns laws,"" he said. ""Every single one of those bills going to have to do with that, because that's what these young people are begging us to do."" Jones added, noting he's 27 years old: ""It’s time for a new generation of voices to step into their power here,"" describing it as a movement to transform the community and the nation with “a new vision of a multicultural democracy."" The Congressional Black Caucus released a statement Monday after Rep. Justin Jones was reinstated to his seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives.  ""We applaud the Nashville City Council for unanimously reappointing Rep. Jones to give voice back to the constituents that sent him to the Legislature. While this is what the residents of Nashville deserve, we must recognize that Rep. Jones was reappointed to his position not because the Republican majority did the right thing, but because Rep. Jones’ constituents in Nashville, joined by supporters from all over our country, peacefully voiced their concerns about the prevalence of gun violence in our communities and the ongoing assault by Republicans on our democracy,"" the statement read. The caucus called for both Reps. Jones and Justin Pearson to be reinstated after the two of them were expelled Thursday after they and Rep. Gloria Johnson — who was not expelled — staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn.  “Rep. Justin Jones’ reappointment is a victory only because the residents of Nashville would not be disenfranchised and cast aside because Republicans would rather put politics over public safety,"" the statement read. Former Rep. Justin Pearson told CNN's John Berman he celebrated the fact that his colleague, Rep. Justin Jones, was reinstated Monday while also understanding another mass shooting had just taken place in Kentucky, not even a month after six people were gunned down in Nashville.  “It is multiple emotions — celebration and of the determination of the people who want to see justice happen with Rep. Jones being reseated and there’s also a painful moment of recognition that our legislators and people like (Speaker of the House) Cameron Sexton and the Republican party in Tennessee and across the South in this country are not doing nearly enough to prevent guns from getting in the hands of people and doing all the holistic work of gun prevention that is necessary in places across our communities,” Pearson said Monday. Pearson and Jones were expelled from the Tennessee House of Representatives on Thursday after the two of them and Rep. Gloria Johnson staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. The chairman of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners has called a special meeting for Wednesday to consider reappointing Pearson to his former seat.  If reinstated, Pearson didn't directly answer if he'd break the rules of decorum again. Instead, he responded: ""Sometimes rules have to be broken for people who have been pushed to the periphery to be brought to the center of the conversation.""  “I believe that our actions were wholly justified in that even though we broke a rule of decorum, we stood up and we spoke for people who needed us to speak for them. … I believe what we did was right and it was for right,” Pearson added. Former Rep. Justin Pearson stood on the steps of the Capitol with Justin Jones Monday, following the city council’s unanimous decision to reinstate Jones as an elected official, and told supporters “the movement lives.” “It's never a good idea to give up on the movement led by people that look like this who are committed to the ideals, but not just committed in heart but in body and spirit, and they'll show up for the movement,” Pearson said. “The movement lives.”  Pearson said that House members were wrong when they thought they could expel Justin Jones and the voice of the people. “They thought that if they could expel the voice of the people, that the people would not rise. They thought that if they could kick out Rep. Justin Jones, that he would never again be representative Justin Jones. But they were wrong,” he said.   Pearson told supporters that having a voice and a vision in the state House matters. “You might try and silence it. You might try and expel it, but the people's power will not be stopped. The people’s power will not be stopped,” he said. “Because this is what democracy looks like.” Rep. Justin Jones welcomed ""the people back to the people's house"" while speaking on the House floor for the first time since being reappointed to his seat as an interim representative. Jones and another Democratic lawmaker Rep. Justin Pearson were expelled from the state House last week over a demonstration for gun control. Jones and Pearson are both Black. A third lawmaker, Rep. Gloria Johnson,  a White woman and Democrat who also participated in the demonstration, survived the vote and held on to her seat in the GOP-dominated chamber. “Today we stand as witness to the resurrection of a movement of a multi-racial democracy, that no unjust decision will stand,"" Jones said Monday. “The people of District 52, all 78,000 people have a voice in this chamber once again."" State Rep. Justin Jones was sworn back into his House District 52 seat as an interim representative Monday. He took the oath on the steps of the state capitol in Nashville surrounded by a crowd of people. The GOP-dominated House voted to expel the state representative last week after he and two other Democrats called for gun reform on the chamber floor.  The vote by Nashville Metropolitan Council on Monday to appoint Jones passed unanimously. Walking arm-in-arm with a crowd of what he described as thousands of people, Rep. Justin Jones walked back to the Tennessee state capital after the Nashville Metropolitan Council voted unanimously to reappoint him to the state House. The council decided to send the ousted lawmaker back to occupy the House District 52 seat as an interim representative on Monday after he was expelled from his seat last week. “Today we’re sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence,"" Jones said to the crowd on the steps of the capital building a few minutes after the vote. He said he hopes this sends a message to Republican leadership and state House Speaker Cameron Sexton that “the people will not let his crimes against democracy happen without challenge."" He called for Sexton to resign as the speaker. Jones and Rep. Justin Pearson, who represents a district in another part of the state, were expelled over their gun control demonstration on the chamber floor following the deadly Nashville school shooting.  Jones said the first thing he plans to do when he gets back in the House is to continue to fight for gun reform. He said people spoke through their elected local council members and that this is bigger than one person or position, that it's a movement “to restore the soul and heart of what this building should represent and that is democracy,” he said pointing to the state capital building. The Nashville Metropolitan Council on Monday voted to reappoint Justin Jones to Tennessee House of Representatives, sending the ousted lawmaker back to occupy the House District 52 seat as an interim representative.   The decision to return Jones to his seat came after the council voted to suspend a procedural rule that prevents an individual from being nominated and appointed to the seat in the same meeting.  The GOP-dominated House voted to expel the state representative last week after he and two other Democrats called for gun reform on the chamber floor The vote to appoint Jones passed 36-0 with no one abstaining.   Minutes before the Nashville Metropolitan City Council were to decide on whether or not to suspend rules and vote former Rep. Justin Jones as an interim member of the House of Representatives, Councilman Brett Withers urged his colleagues to place Jones back in his seat after the lawmaker was expelled Thursday along with former Rep. Justin Pearson. “I implore my colleagues not to play political games, to listen to the will of all of the voters and to place Justin Jones back in his rightful place in the General Assembly this evening,” Withers told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Withers told Tapper he believes there will be enough votes to place Jones back in his seat and that the council is hearing from supporters throughout the state. “So I believe that not only do we have the votes to confirm Justin this afternoon at 4:30, I would strongly encourage any of my colleagues to avoid objecting to the suspension of the rules,"" Withers said. Withers said there are many in the community who want Jones back in his seat. “There are just so many people who are hurting right now and are angry – justifiably angry – and this is not an appropriate time to play political games like that. We need to get Justin Jones back to his rightful place representing House District 52 in the General Assembly,” he said. Withers told Tapper he believes that racism played a role in the expulsion and has been an issue in the General Assembly. “I think that we have seen so much racism, frankly, from our General Assembly – that definitely plays a role,” Withers said. “But nevertheless, the results speak for themselves and really speak to the level of racism that we've seen from our general assembly for quite a long while now and seemingly getting worse and worse every year.” Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton will not prevent ousted representatives Justin Jones or Justin Pearson from being seated if their local governing bodies appoint them to serve as interim representatives in their former districts, a spokesperson for the Republican Speaker's office tells CNN.  “The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats. Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires,” Doug Kufner, Sexton's communications director, said in a statement provided to CNN on Monday.  The Metropolitan Council in Nashville is expected to vote this afternoon during a called special meeting at 4: 30 p.m. local time (5:30 p.m.ET).  The chairman of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners has also called a special meeting to consider reappointing Justin Pearson to his former seat as the District 86 State Representative.  The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, at 1:30 p.m. local time (2:30 p.m. ET).    The Nashville mayor's office has quietly been encouraging council members to vote to reinstate Justin Jones into his former seat as an interim successor, according to a metro official with knowledge of events happening. At a special meeting called for Monday afternoon, the Metropolitan Council will officially announce the vacancy of the District 52 seat, then vote to nominate Justin Jones to fill the seat.  Then, council members will vote to suspend the rule prohibiting an individual from being nominated and appointed within the same meeting allowing the council to vote to formally appoint Jones to the Tennessee House as soon as Monday afternoon.  The special meeting is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. local time (5:30 p.m. ET).    The expulsion of Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson from the Tennessee House was a rare move. The House has only expelled two state representatives in the last 157 years.  The first expulsion, in 1980, was of a representative found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office, and the most recent came in 2016 when another member was expelled over allegations of sexual harassment. Democratic Rep. Joe Towns called the move a “nuclear option.” “You never use a sledgehammer to kill a gnat,” Towns said. “We should not go to the extreme of expelling our members for fighting for what many of the citizens want to happen, whether you agree with it or not.” The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Kathy Sinback, called the move in a statement a “targeted expulsion of two Black legislators without due process.” “It raises questions about the disparate treatment of Black representatives, while continuing the shameful legacy of disenfranchising and silencing the voices of marginalized communities and the Black lawmakers they elect,” Sinback added. Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were kicked out of the legislature by their colleagues in a vote Thursday. A third member also up for expulsion, Rep. Gloria Johnson, survived the vote, which required two-thirds majority support in the Republican-dominated chamber. Jones' and Pearson's pictures and profiles had already been removed from the state’s General Assembly website, a symbol of the vacant seats that now need to be filled. All three had been accused by Republicans of “knowingly and intentionally” bringing “disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives” after they led a gun control protest on the House floor last month without being recognized, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. In the wake of a deadly shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, which killed three 9-year-olds and three adults, Jones said he and other lawmakers were blocked from raising the issue of gun violence on the House floor, with their microphones being cut off whenever they raised the topic, according to WSMV. According to the expulsion resolutions, Jones, Pearson and Johnson “began shouting without recognition” during their protest and “proceeded to disrupt the proceedings of the House Representatives.” Video showed the trio using a bullhorn. Republican leaders in the chamber condemned the lawmakers’ actions and moved quickly to remove their committee assignments and schedule a vote for their expulsion. Jones, Pearson and Johnson decried the Republicans’ actions as oppressive, vindictive and racially motivated. Jones and Pearson are both young, Black men while Johnson is a White woman. Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton called their actions “unacceptable” and argued that they broke “several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor.” During Monday's special meeting of the Metropolitan Council in Nashville, Delishia Porterfield, the person who ran against Justin Jones for the District 52 seat in the primary election and lost, is expected to nominate him to serve on an interim basis, Vice Mayor Jim Shulman told CNN’s Isabel Rosales. If the council successfully suspends the rule prohibiting nominating and appointing an interim representative during same meeting, they will likely vote ""on the board,"" Shulman said. After the votes are counted, the results will be visible on the screen. A simple majority — 21 of the 40 members — is required to appoint Jones. As local leaders in Nashville prepare to potentially send an ousted lawmaker back to the Tennessee House of Representatives, a member told CNN Sunday that he is unaware of any threats of political retribution for their decision. On Saturday, Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Hendrell Remus said Memphis and Shelby counties received threats that they could lose funding if they reinstate the other ousted state representative, Justin Pearson, until holding a special election. “I don't know that, here in Nashville, that we received such threats about nominating Justin Jones back to his seat. But that kind of rhetoric, that kind of threat is very troubling. We need to have good relations between the state and the local municipalities,” Nashville Metropolitan Councilmember Jeff Syracuse said. “If that is the case, they need to stop with those kinds of threats. We need to ensure stability here amongst relations from the state and local municipalities,” Syracuse added. How the vote will work: During Monday’s meeting, the council will vote on whether suspend the rules which typically do not allow a member to be nominated and appointed in the same meeting, Syracuse told CNN. If two or more members oppose that process, the measure will fail. If that happens, it would be at least four weeks until the council could vote to appoint Jones back to his seat, Syracuse said. Syracuse said he did not believe Jones deserved to be kicked out of the legislature. “Justin has a very important voice on this topic ... which is gun control and school safety. So we need him back there. There's an understanding that decorum was broken for sure. But it was an egregious act to actually expel him and Justin Pearson from the legislation. That action did not meet the transgression that, that occurred,” Syracuse said. Justin Pearson, one of two state lawmakers recently ousted from the Tennessee House of Representatives for a gun control protest on the House floor, spoke in an Easter Sunday service at Church of the River in Memphis, thanking the congregation and the community for its support.     ""To District 86 I thank you for believing in me, for entrusting me and expecting me to serve as best as I possibly can,"" Pearson said, during the Sunday service.   ""The Republican-led supermajority of the Tennessee General Assembly sought to have a political lynching of three of its members because we spoke out of turn against the status quo of the government after the tragic death of six people in the shooting of the Covenant school in Nashville,"" he said. Pearson referenced Martin Luther King Jr., noting the civil rights leader was killed on April 4, 1968, in Memphis.    ""Fifty-five years ago this week, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by gun violence. I tell you what: His words, from what he spoke just days before he was assassinated, are still true. The movement lives or dies in Memphis.""      Pearson repeated the phrase, ""The movement lives or dies in Memphis,"" as applause erupted throughout the church.    Jason Pearson, the Memphis lawmakers' father serves as pastor of the Community of Faith Christian Church. Before his son spoke, he led the congregation in prayer, and told the crowd: ""There have been some hard days and some difficult moments.""    ""When somebody is crucifying your baby, it's hard to be silent,"" Jason said.   ""I got to use my voice in this moment because that's all I've got,"" he added. ""I don't have any power. I don't have any other way to stop them from crucifying my baby but I'm going to say and let him that his family is standing with him.""  The Tennessee House had only expelled two other representatives in the last 157 years, and the move required a two-thirds majority vote of the total membership. Just hours after the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Democratic lawmakers, their pictures and profiles had already been removed from the state’s General Assembly website, a symbol of the vacant seats that now need to be filled. Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were kicked out of the legislature by their colleagues in a vote Thursday. Focus in Tennessee is now on filling those two new vacancies.  Special election to come: According to the Tennessee Constitution, since there are more than 12 months until the next general election in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats. No date has been set for a special election but state law says the governor should schedule them within 55 to 60 days. Temporary appointments: In the time between when a seat becomes vacant and when a special election can be held, “the legislative body of the replaced legislator’s county of residence at the time of his or her election may elect an interim successor,” the state Constitution says. For Jones’ District 52 seat, the local legislative body is Nashville and Davidson County's Metropolitan Council. The council has scheduled a special meeting on Monday afternoon to address the vacancy and possibly vote on an interim successor. Nashville Mayor John Cooper has expressed his support for Jones and said on Twitter he believes the council will send him “right back to continue serving his constituents.” Jones told CNN’s Don Lemon on Friday that if he’s appointed by the council, he will serve. “I have no regrets. I will continue to stand up for my constituents,” he said. For Pearson’s District 86 seat, the local legislative body is the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in Memphis. Commission chairman Mickell Lowery plans to call a special meeting regarding Pearson’s expulsion, CNN affiliate WMC reported, but the timing of the meeting isn’t yet known. Pearson said he hopes to “get reappointed to serve in the state legislature."" Referring to the Shelby County commissioners, he said: “A lot of them, I know, are upset about the anti-democratic behavior of this White supremacist-led state legislature.” Former Tennessee State Rep. Justin Jones said he would ""most definitely"" serve his district again if appointed to do so. It comes after he and another Black lawmaker were expelled from their seats in the majority-GOP legislature Thursday for peacefully protesting gun violence alongside their constituents.  Jones and the other ousted lawmaker, Rep. Justin Pearson, called for protesters to return to the Capitol when the House is back in session on Monday. ""That's what we were asking for — the most very basic thing was to ban assault weapons so we can stop these mass shootings, instead they responded by assaulting democracy,"" Jones said Friday. ""I think what happened was a travesty of democracy because they expelled the two youngest Black lawmakers, which is no coincidence from the Tennessee state legislature because we are outspoken, because we fight for our district and I will, you know, want to continue to do that whether I'm inside the chamber or outside the chamber,"" Jones said. A third representative on the chopping block, Rep. Gloria Johnson, a White woman, avoided expulsion by one vote. ""They retaliated not because of that one incident of us going to the well and joining those young people protesting gun violence, but because they got tired and did not feel like young Black men have a right to be at the same dais as them,"" Jones said. Nashville's Metropolitan Council will vote next week to appoint an interim representative for Jones' district, a role which Jones said he would happily step back into if he's re-appointed.  ""We will fight for a multi-racial democracy, and so this extreme tactic to expel us and to try to humiliate us has only put a spotlight of the world on Tennessee,"" he said. ""I would go back because … I'm fighting for the future that I want to live in, that I want my children to live in. It's worth whatever sacrifices that we have to give.""  Reps. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson were voted out of the Tennessee House after advocating for gun reform without being recognized. The lawmakers' protests followed the recent deadly shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, which killed three 9-year-olds and three adults. Jones, Pearson, and a third Democratic lawmaker — Rep. Gloria Johnson, who did not lose her seat — were accused by Republicans of breaking “several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor,"" Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton said. Tennessee Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison told CNN that the caucus believed the issue did not need to be considered by an ethics committee and accused Jones and Pearson of having a “history” of disrupting floor proceedings. “It’s not possible for us to move forward with the way they were behaving in committee and on the House floor,” Faison said. “There’s got to be some peace.” The chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, Hendrell Remus, called the move a “direct political attack” on the party. “Their expulsion sets a dangerous new precedent for political retribution,” a statement from the party said. “The day that a majority can simply expel a member of the opposing party without legitimate cause threatens the fabric of democracy in our state and creates a reckless roadmap for GOP controlled state legislatures across the nation.” Rep. Sam McKenzie, chair of the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, said the expulsion of Jones and Pearson overshadowed the issue they were protesting. “This was not about that kangaroo court that happened yesterday. This was about those three young children and those three guardians, those three adults, whose lives were taken away senselessly,” McKenzie said. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Nashville Friday to advocate gun control and meet with Democratic state lawmakers, including Jones, Pearson and Johnson, as well as other local advocates. She gave a fiery speech, saying the three lawmakers had led with courage and were reflecting the ""cries,"" ""pleas"" and ""demands"" of their constituents. “We understand when we took an oath to represent the people who elected us that we speak on behalf of them,” she said. ""It wasn’t about the three of these leaders. It was about who they were representing. It’s about whose voices they were channeling. Understand that – and is that not what a democracy allows?” President Joe Biden called the lawmakers' expulsion “shocking, undemocratic and without precedent” and criticized Republicans for not taking greater action on gun reform, according to a statement Thursday. “Rather than debating the merits of the issue, these Republican lawmakers have chosen to punish, silence, and expel duly-elected representatives of the people of Tennessee,” the president said.

                      The Texas pardons board is investigating after GOP governor's request in case of sergeant convicted of killing protester at 2020 BLM rally

                      The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is launching an investigation upon the Republican governor's request for an expedited probe and pardon recommendation for a US Army sergeant convicted Friday of killing a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020. ""The board will be commencing that investigation immediately"" and will report to the governor with recommendations when it's done, board spokesperson Rachel Alderete said Monday. The board didn't immediately say how long the inquiry could take or whether an appeal process is required ahead of a recommendation. Daniel Perry, the White Army sergeant and ride-share driver, was indicted on a charge of murder in 2021 for the fatal shooting of Garrett Foster, who is also White, at a Black Lives Matter protest in Austin, Texas. He was also charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and deadly conduct for his behavior at the protest. A Travis County jury on Friday convicted Perry, 35, of murder. The jury found him not guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and the deadly conduct charge is still pending with the county attorney's office. Gov. Greg Abbott was ""working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sgt. Perry,"" Abbott tweeted Saturday afternoon, explaining Texas law allows the governor to request the state's pardon board to determine if a pardon should be granted, and he'd ""made that request and instructed the Board to expedite its review."" Abbott also referenced Texas' ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which he called ""one of the strongest"" in the country. Such laws generally allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be. Perry's defense has argued he shot Foster in self-defense after Foster approached his car with an assault-style rifle. Perry was an active-duty sergeant working for a ride-share service to make extra money at the time of the killing, his lawyers have said. Perry had dropped off a client near the protest and did not know the event, which followed the in-custody death of Black father George Floyd, was taking place, his defense has said. He carried a handgun in his car for protection as a driver, according to his lawyers. The prosecution argued Perry initiated the encounter by running a red light to turn into the crowd gathered for the protest against police brutality and had previously posted on social media about shooting protesters, according to CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster, 28, died shortly after the shooting. Foster's mother, Sheila Foster, said her son was a Libertarian and had marched for ""50 straight days in the Texas summer heat against systemic racism.""  ""My son was marching because he believed in equality and in our Constitutional rights.  He was fighting the abuse of power. He did not deserve to die, and justice for my son should not be politicized,"" she said in a statement.  Perry's lawyer, Clint Broden, was disappointed with the verdict, he said. ""We are disappointed in the verdict both as it relates to Daniel Perry and as it relates to a citizen's ability to defend themselves,"" Broden told CNN on Saturday. ""Sgt. Perry will, of course, appeal the verdict and we are hopeful that the case will ultimately be overturned on appeal."" A judge on Monday is expected to set a sentencing hearing for Perry. Quentin Brogdon, a civil attorney for the Foster family, criticized Abbott's move for a pardon before the sentencing and the appeals process, saying it ""turns the rule of law on its head."" The 12 jurors in the case heard 40 witnesses and deliberated for 15 hours, and state and federal appeals courts are allowed to overturn the conviction ""if it is contrary to the rule of law,"" Brogdon said in a statement.  ""Nobody, including the Governor of the State of Texas should shut down that process, and any attempt to do so threatens the rule of law for all of us,"" Brogdon said.  Whitney Mitchell, Foster's longtime partner who was with Foster the night he was killed, said she was relieved to learn the verdict, but now feels she's living a ""nightmare"" again after the governor began pushing for a pardon. ""I just thought it was disgusting,"" she told CNN in an interview. ""I don't think that (Abbott) has fully, like, read the case or knows what's going on with it. And I honestly can't understand this decision."" Mitchell has been reliving the moment Foster died for three years, she said.  ""He was the love of my life. He took care of me. I grew up with him,"" she said. ""I don't know what to do. He's been gone for so long and I'm still trying to figure out what to do."" The pardon process ""is outside our control,"" Perry's attorney said in response to Abbott's tweet. Perry's legal team is focused on ""the upcoming sentencing hearing and marshaling evidence related to Sgt. Perry's character and his service to our country,"" he said. Travis County District Attorney José Garza called Abbott's comments that he would intervene in the case ""deeply troubling,"" and on Monday said that just by announcing his intention, Abbott had ""undermined the rule of law in the state of Texas, and he has made our community less safe."" ""Every single day here in Travis County, we hold people accountable who commit acts of gun violence,"" Garza told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. ""We are going to continue to hold people accountable who commit acts of gun violence, and obviously, if the governor wants to continue to pardon people who commit acts of gun violence, that's up to him, but there is no doubt in my mind that it makes our community less safe,"" Garza said.  Garza said he is also thinking about Foster's parents and fiancée, who are ""heartbroken right now."" ""They waited so long to have their moment in court. They waited so long for justice for their son, and justice, I think, feels so elusive to them right know,"" he said.  ""I want them to know that the Travis County District Attorney's Office is going to continue to fight for a criminal justice system where everyone is treated equally, including Garrett Foster,"" the prosecutor said.

                      The Italian Coast Guard was on Tuesday escorting two boats carrying 1,200 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, as part of a major operation in a region that has seen migrant arrivals spike in the past year.  Emergency workers were racing to rescue a barge with 400 migrants onboard that had ran out of fuel, according to the volunteer-run service Alarm Phone. The Coast Guard told CNN later Monday that it is also escorting another vessel carrying 800 migrants. ""Due to the prohibitive sea conditions, the Peluso ship, the Diciotti ship and the Coast Guard patrol boats are escorting the two units, in difficulty since yesterday, with migrants on board,"" the Coast Guard said on Twitter. ""The ships, carrying 400 and 800 migrants, got into trouble in rough seas on Monday."" Alarm Phone said in a tweet earlier that it had spoken to passengers at 10.56 a.m. local time (4.56 a.m. ET), describing the situation on board as ""dramatic,"" with the boat starting to leak. ""They report several medical emergencies, water filling the vessel and no fuel left. We have informed the authorities,"" Alarm phone said.  The coast guard is traveling next to the boat en route to Italy because an escort is ""safer"" than attempting to rescue those on board in poor weather, said Felix Weiss, a spokesman for Sea-Watch International, a German organization that runs search and rescue operations in the central Mediterranean.    The migrants had been stranded along an immigration route between Italy and Malta that NGOs have warned is perilously dangerous. The boat with 400 migrants departed from Tobruk, Libya, and had been at risk of capsizing with water in the hull, according to Alarm Phone. The service also said many on board required medical attention, including a child, a pregnant woman and a disabled person.  The Italian Coast Guard also said Monday that more than 1,700 migrants had arrived on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa in the last 48 hours. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, is a major destination for migrants seeking to enter European Union countries. Every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution and poverty risk the treacherous route in search of safety and better economic prospects. In many cases, their vessels are overcrowded and unfit for the journey, and the need to rescue migrants on board often leads to disputes between countries about who should take them in. More than 28,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, according to the country's Interior Ministry -- a significant surge compared to recent years. The number of migrants arriving in Italy this year are the highest seen in the country since 2017, according to figures by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Most arrivals have journeyed from the Ivory Coast, Guinea, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Pakistan.

                      Two police officers and another person were killed in an exchange of gunfire during a traffic stop in northwestern Wisconsin on Saturday, authorities said. The gunfire erupted after an officer from the Chetek Police Department conducted a traffic stop in Cameron around 3:38 p.m. local time, according to a news release from the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Notified of ""concerning behavior,"" the officers were conducting the stop based on a warrant and to check the welfare of the driver, 50-year-old Glenn Douglas Perry. The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday identified the two officers as Chetek Police Officer Emily Breidenbach, 32, and Cameron Police Officer Hunter Scheel, 23. Perry was taken to a hospital and was later also pronounced dead, the news release said. The Wisconsin Department of Justice earlier said it is investigating the incident.  The department's Division of Criminal Investigation ""is continuing to review evidence and determine the facts of this incident and will turn over investigative reports to the Barron County District Attorney when the investigation concludes,"" the news release said.

                      Around 100 people, including women and children, have been killed after Myanmar's military junta bombed the Kant Balu township in the Sagaing region on Tuesday, according to the shadow government of the ousted administration. The attack resulted in the ""loss of scores of innocent civilians and injuring many more, including children and pregnant women,"" the National Unity Government (NUG)'s Ministry of Labour said in a statement, describing it as a ""heinous act"" that constitutes ""a war crime.""  Local news outlet The Irrawaddy reported that a junta aircraft dropped two bombs and fired on the village while people were gathered for the opening of a new town office.  The military junta has not yet commented publicly on the alleged attack. CNN has reached out to a military junta spokesperson, but not yet heard back.  Photos and videos shared by The Irrawaddy and other local media show bodies of victims, as well as destroyed buildings, vehicles and debris after the air raid. CNN has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos.  The Union Prime Minister of the NUG Mahn Winn Khine Thann said on Twitter he was ""heartbroken"" by the ""aerial massacre."" Thousands of people have been killed across Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in February 2021. The junta ousted democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was later sentenced to 33 years in jail during secretive trials. It has cracked down on anti-coup protests, arrested journalists and political prisoners, and executed several leading pro-democracy activists, drawing condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups. Two years on, the Southeast Asian country is being rocked by violence and instability. The economy has collapsed, with shortages of food, fuel and other basic supplies. The US last month placed a fresh series of sanctions on two people with alleged ties to the military and three businesses owned by them, a statement from the State Department said.

                      Four days after being expelled by Tennessee's Republican-controlled House of Representatives, Democrat Justin Jones marched back to the Capitol on Monday following a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council to reappoint him as an interim representative. His return representing Nashville's House District 52 put a exclamation point on a remarkable 100-hour stretch in which Jones and another Black Democrat, Justin Pearson, lost their seats in an extraordinary, emotionally charged legislative session, after calling for gun reform during a protest on the chamber floor. A third Democrat who had joined them, Rep. Gloria Johnson, narrowly avoided expulsion during Thursday's House session. Jones returned to the House floor to cheers. His fellow Democrat, Rep. Antonio Parkinson, introduced him to the session as ""our newest member."" After the city council decision late in the afternoon, Jones joined demonstrators in a march to the state Capitol. The crowd gathered at the meeting erupted into cheers after the vote. Those marching with Jones chanted, ""Whose house? Our House."" Speaking from the steps of the Capitol after walking the four blocks from City Hall, Jones told the crowd: ""Today we are sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence. Today we send a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge."" State law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held. The 36-0 vote to return Jones to his seat followed a vote to suspend a procedural rule that prevents an individual from being nominated and appointed to the seat in the same meeting.  On Thursday, Jones and Pearson were forced out of the legislature in a two-thirds majority vote cast by their Republican colleagues. Johnson, a White woman, survived the vote and held on to her seat. Sexton earlier indicated he would not stand in the way of the appointments if the local governing bodies choose to send Jones and Pearson back to the chamber. ""The two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats,"" a spokesperson for the speaker's office told CNN Monday. ""Those two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires."" Pearson's vacant District 86 seat will be addressed during a special meeting of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in Memphis on Wednesday afternoon, Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery said. ""I believe the expulsion of State Representative Justin Pearson was conducted in a hasty manner without consideration of other corrective action methods,"" Lowery said in a statement. Pearson joined Jones on the steps of the Capitol after the Nashville Metropolitan Council vote.  ""It's never a good idea to give up on the movement led by people that look like this, who are committed to the ideals but not just committed in heart but in body and spirit... they'll show up for the movement,"" Pearson said. ""The movement lives."" Having a voice and a vision in the state House matters, Pearson told supporters.  ""You might try and silence it. You might try and expel it, but the people's power will not be stopped,"" he said. ""Because this is what democracy looks like."" 'The world is watching Tennessee' Protesters planned a day of action that included a rally before the Metro Council meeting before the march to the state Capitol.  The expulsions and expected protest are part of the long-standing debate over the accessibility of guns in America, with this latest standoff spurred by the mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead, including three 9-year-old children.  In the wake of that shooting, Jones, Pearson and Johnson took to the state House floor to advocate for gun control, using a bullhorn to address their colleagues and protesters.  Republicans accused the trio of ""knowingly and intentionally"" bringing ""disorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives"" without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. Republicans then held a party-line vote Thursday to oust Jones and Pearson. The expelled representatives called the expulsions undemocratic and racist. ""What happened was a travesty of democracy because they expelled the two youngest Black lawmakers, which is no coincidence from the Tennessee Legislature,"" Jones said Friday on ""CNN This Morning."" ""Because we are outspoken, because we fight for our district."" Pearson, speaking at an Easter Sunday service at The Church of the River in Memphis, thanked the congregation and community for their support. ""The Republican-led supermajority of the Tennessee General Assembly sought to have a political lynching of three of its members because we spoke out of turn against the status quo of the government, after the tragic deaths of six people in the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville,"" he said. Attorneys for the ousted representatives -- among them former US Attorney General Eric Holder -- called their removals ""unconstitutional"" in a letter Monday to Sexton, saying, ""Their partisan expulsion was extraordinary, illegal and without any historical or legal precedent."" The letter from Holder and attorney Scott J. Crosby -- who are representing Jones and Pearson, respectively -- urged the House to not ""compound its errors by taking any further retributive actions.""  ""The world is watching Tennessee,"" the letter said. ""Any partisan retributive action, such as the discriminatory treatment of elected officials, or threats or actions to withhold funding for government programs, would constitute further unconstitutional action that would require redress.""   Special election will be held  According to the Tennessee Constitution, since the next general election is more than 12 months away, in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats. Tennessee law allows for the appointment of interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until the special election is held. No date has been set for a special election but state law provides a time frame for when the governor should schedule them. A ""writ of election"" for ""primary elections for nominations by statewide political parties to fill the vacancy"" must be scheduled within 55 to 60 days, state code says. And a general election to fill the vacancy must be scheduled within 100 to 107 days. It appears both Jones and Pearson qualify to run for their seats again in the special election.  According to Tennessee law, a state representative must be at least 21 years old, a US citizen, a resident of the state for at least three years and a resident of their county for one year preceding the election. They must also be a qualified voter of the district, which requires a resident to be 18 years old and free of certain felony convictions. Both Jones and Pearson meet those qualifications. And while the state Constitution says members can be expelled for disorderly behavior with a two-thirds majority vote, they cannot be expelled ""a second time for the same offense."" Biden rebukes rare expulsions Expelling lawmakers is quite rare in Tennessee, and last week's vote from the state's Republican supermajority has drawn reactions from scores of high profile officials.  On Thursday, President Joe Biden called the expulsions ""shocking, undemocratic and without precedent"" while criticizing Republicans for not taking greater action on gun reform. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Nashville on Friday to advocate for stricter gun control measures and highlight the importance of protecting Americans from gun violence. She also privately met with Jones, Pearson and Johnson. ""We understand when we took an oath to represent the people who elected us that we speak on behalf of them. It wasn't about the three of these leaders,"" Harris said in remarks after the meeting. ""It was about who they were representing. It's about whose voices they were channeling. Understand that -- and is that not what a democracy allows?"" Jones said he and the other lawmakers had been blocked from speaking about gun violence on the House floor that week, saying that their microphones were cut off whenever they raised the topic, WSMV reported. Following the three representatives' demonstrations last Thursday, Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton called their actions ""unacceptable"" and argued that they broke ""several rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor."" There have been two expulsions in the state House over the past 157 years. The last expulsion in the state House was in 2016, when a representative was expelled over allegations of sexual harassment. In 1980, a representative was expelled after a member was found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office. Standing on the Tennessee House floor for the first time after being reinstated, Jones said, ""I want to welcome the people back to the people's House."" ""Today we stand as witness to the resurrection of a movement of a multi-racial democracy, that no unjust decision will stand,"" Jones said. ""The people of District 52, all 78,000 people, have a voice in this chamber once again.""

                      The 32-year-old man accused of stabbing an imam at a mosque Sunday in New Jersey pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder charge in court Monday afternoon. Serif Zorba was arrested for allegedly stabbing Imam Sayed Elnakib of the Omar Mosque in Paterson. Elnakib, who is in stable condition, was stabbed during the first prayer of the day around 5:30 a.m. while the congregation was kneeling, mosque spokesperson Abdul Hamdan told CNN. Surveillance video of the incident shows a group of worshippers at the mosque positioned in five long rows. As they knelt down in prayer, a person wearing a hoodie in the third row moved to the front of the room, stepping over other worshippers, and then thrust his right hand into the back of the kneeling imam, the video shows. The congregation then rose together, and the assailant tried to push through the crowd and flee out of the back of the mosque, the video shows. Zorba was charged with first-degree attempted murder, third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a weapon, according to a news release from the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. Zorba, a native of Istanbul, also pleaded not guilty to the unlawful weapon possession charges. His plea was entered Monday by a public defender on Zorba's behalf.  The suspect appeared in court before Paterson Municipal Court Judge Vincenzo Stampone wearing an orange jumpsuit, with his long hair mostly covering his face. Zorba communicated with court officials through a Turkish translator.  When Stampone asked Zorba about his current address, Zorba indicated that he lived in Paterson but did not offer a proper address.  Zorba is being held on pretrial detention. His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday.   The prosecutor's office said they could not provide any further details on Zorba's possible motive, citing the ongoing investigation.  The maximum sentence for his alleged crimes is around 26 years, according to the release.

                      A surfer has been hospitalized in serious condition following an encounter with a shark off the south shore of Oahu in Hawaii, according to a spokesperson for Honolulu Emergency Services. Shayne Enright told CNN on Sunday morning, a 58-year-old man was bitten by a shark while surfing in Kewalo Basin. Enright credited other surfers around the victim with helping to save his life. She said they were able to tourniquet his right leg while still in the water and help him to shore. First responders transported the man to a hospital in serious condition. Enright said he stayed awake and conscious throughout treatment and transport. The shark is believed to be about an eight-foot tiger shark based on witness accounts, she said. Following the incident, lifeguards posted signs throughout the south shore warning of a shark in the area and set up jet-ski patrols in the water to monitor for additional shark activity, according to Enright. An incident list on the Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Aquatic Resources page indicates it is the fourth shark encounter in Hawaii this year. It's only the second incident in the Kewalo area since 2002.

                      What markets are watching after digesting the US jobs data

                      In an unusual coincidence, the US jobs report was released on a holiday Friday — meaning stock markets were closed when the closely-watched economic data came out.  It was the first monthly payroll report since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed. It also marked a full year of jobs data since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in March 2022. While inflation has come down and other economic data point to a cooling economy, the labor market has remained remarkably resilient.  Investors have had a long weekend to chew over the details of the report and will likely skip the typical gut-reaction to headline numbers.  What happened: The US economy added 236,000 jobs in March, showing that hiring remained robust though the pace was slower than in previous months. The unemployment rate currently stands at 3.5%. Wages increased by 0.3% on the month and 4.2% from a year ago. The three-month wage growth average has dropped to 3.8%. That's moving closer to what Fed policymakers ""believe to be in line with stable wage and inflation expectations,"" wrote Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in a note.  ""That wage data tends to suggest that the risk of a wage price spiral is easing and that will create space in the near term for the Federal Reserve to engage in a strategic pause in its efforts to restore price stability,"" he added. The March jobs report was the last before the Fed's next policy meeting and announcement in early May. The labor market is cooling but not rapidly or significantly, and further rate hikes can't be ruled out.  At the same time Wall Street is beginning to see bad news as bad news. A slowing economy could mean a recession is forthcoming. Markets are still largely expecting the Fed to raise rates by another quarter point. So how will they react to Friday's report? Before the Bell spoke with Michael Arone, State Street Global Advisors chief investment strategist, to find out.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Before the Bell: How do you expect markets to react to this report on Monday? Michael Arone: I think that this has been a nice counterbalance to the weaker labor data earlier last week and all the recession fears. This data suggests that the economy is still in pretty good shape, 10-year Treasury yields increased on Friday indicating there's less fear about an imminent recession.  There's this delicate balance between slower job growth and a weaker labor market without economic devastation. I think this report helps that.  As it relates to the stock market, I would expect the cyclical sectors to do well — your industrials, your materials, your energy companies. If interest rates are rising, that's going to weigh on growth stocks — technology and communication services sectors, for example. Less recession fears will mean investors won't be as defensively positioned in classic staples like healthcare and utilities.  Could this lead to a reverse in the current trend where tech companies are bolstering markets? Yes, exactly. It's difficult to make too much out of any singular data point, but I think this report will hopefully lead to broader participation in the stock market. If those recession fears begin to abate somewhat, and investors recognize that recession isn't imminent, there will be more investment.  What else are investors looking at in this report? We've seen weakness in the interest rate sensitive parts of the market — areas that are typically the first to weaken as the economy slows down. So things like manufacturing, things like construction. That's where the weakness in this jobs report is. And the services areas continue to remain strong. That's where the shortage of qualified skilled workers remains. I think that you're seeing continued job strength in those areas.  What does this mean for this week's inflation reports? It seems like the jobs report just pushed the tension forward.  it did. I expect that inflation figures will continue to decelerate — or grow at a slower rate. But I do think that the sticky part of inflation continues to be on the wage front. And so I think, if anything, this helps alleviate some of those inflation pressures, but we'll see how it flows through into the CPI report next week. And also the PPI report. Is the Federal Reserve addressing real structural changes to the labor market?  The Fed was confused in February 2020 when we were in full employment and there was no inflation. They're equally confused today, after raising rates from zero to 5%, that we haven't had more job losses. I'm not sure why, but from my perspective, the Fed hasn't taken into consideration the structural changes in the labor force, and they're still confused by it. I think the risk here is that they'll continue to focus on raising rates to stabilize prices, perhaps underestimating the kind of structural changes in the labor economy that haven't resulted in the type of weakness that they've been anticipating. I think that's a risk for the economy and markets. More trouble for commercial real estate  A few weeks ago, Before the Bell wrote about big problems brewing in the $20 trillion commercial real estate industry.  After decades of thriving growth bolstered by low interest rates and easy credit, commercial real estate has hit a wall. Office and retail property valuations have been falling since the pandemic brought about lower occupancy rates and changes in where people work and how they shop. The Fed's efforts to fight inflation by raising interest rates have also hurt the credit-dependent industry. Recent banking stress will likely add to those woes. Lending to commercial real estate developers and managers largely comes from small and mid-sized banks, where the pressure on liquidity has been most severe. About 80% of all bank loans for commercial properties come from regional banks, according to Goldman Sachs economists. Since then, things have gotten worse, CNN's Julia Horowitz reports.  In a worst-case scenario, anxiety about bank lending to commercial real estate could spiral, prompting customers to yank their deposits. A bank run is what toppled Silicon Valley Bank last month, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a recession. ""We're watching it pretty closely,"" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, a wealth manager. While he doesn't expect office loans to become a problem for all banks, ""one or two"" institutions could find themselves ""caught offside."" Signs of strain are increasing. The proportion of commercial office mortgages where borrowers are behind with payments is rising, according to Trepp, which provides data on commercial real estate. High-profile defaults are making headlines. Earlier this year, a landlord owned by asset manager PIMCO defaulted on nearly $2 billion in debt for seven office buildings in San Francisco, New York City, Boston and Jersey City. Dig into Julia's story here.  What will become of tech earnings? Tech stocks led market losses in 2022, but seemed to rebound quickly at the start of this year. So as we enter earnings season, what should we expect from Big Tech? Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, says that he has high hopes.  ""Tech stocks have held up very well so far in 2023 and comfortably outpaced the overall market as we believe the tech sector has become the new 'safety trade' in this overall uncertain market,"" he wrote in a note on Sunday evening.  Even the recent spate of layoffs in Big Tech has upside, he wrote.  ""Significant cost cutting underway in the Valley led by Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and others, conservative guidance already given in the January earnings season 'rip the band- aid off moment', and tech fundamentals that are holding up in a shaky macro [environment] are setting up for a green light for tech stocks.""

                      From Dallas and Minneapolis to New York and Los Angeles, offices sit vacant or underused, showing the staying power of the work-from-home era. But clear desks and quiet break rooms aren't just a headache for bosses eager to gather teams in person.  Investors and regulators, on high alert for signs of trouble in the financial system following recent bank failures, are now homing in on the downturn in the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market. Just as lenders to the sector grapple with turmoil triggered by rapidly rising interest rates, the value of buildings such as offices is crashing. That could add to pain for banks and raises concerns about damaging ripple effects.  ""Although this is not yet a systemic problem for the banking sector, there are legitimate concerns about contagion,"" said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. In the worst-case scenario, anxiety about bank lending to commercial real estate could spiral, prompting customers to yank their deposits. A bank run is what toppled Silicon Valley Bank last month, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a recession in the United States. Asked about the danger posed by commercial real estate, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last month that banks remained ""strong"" and ""resilient."" But attention is growing on the links between US lenders and the property sector.  ""We're watching it pretty closely,"" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, a wealth manager. While he doesn't expect office loans to become a problem for all banks, ""one or two"" institutions could find themselves ""caught offside.""  America's top banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, told CNN Thursday that he couldn't be sure whether more banks will fail this year. Yet he was quick to point out that the current situation was very different to the 2008 global financial crisis, when there were ""hundreds of institutions around the world with far too much leverage."" The US market looks most vulnerable. Yet the European Central Bank and Bank of England have also recently warned of risks tied to commercial real estate as the outlook for prices deteriorates. Work-from-home bill comes due Commercial real estate — which spans offices, apartment complexes, warehouses and malls — has come under substantial pressure in recent months. Prices in the United States were down 15% in March from their recent peak, according to data provider Green Street. The rapid increase in interest rates over the past year has been painful, since purchases of commercial buildings are typically financed with large loans. Office properties have been getting hammered the hardest. Hybrid work remains popular, affecting the rents many building owners can charge. Average occupancy of offices in the United States is still less than half March 2020 levels, according to data from security provider Kastle.  ""You have fundamentals under pressure from work from home at a time when lending is less available than [it has been] over the last decade,"" said Rich Hill, head of real estate strategy at Cohen & Steers. ""Those two factors will lead to a pretty significant decline in valuations."" Trouble may build as the economy slows. Hill thinks US commercial property valuations could fall roughly 20% to 25% this year. For offices, declines could be even steeper, topping 30%. ""I'm more concerned than I've been in a long time,"" said Matt Anderson, managing director at Trepp, which provides data on commercial real estate. Signs of strain are increasing. The proportion of commercial office mortgages where borrowers are behind with payments is rising, according to Trepp, and high-profile defaults are making headlines. Earlier this year, a landlord owned by asset manager PIMCO defaulted on nearly $2 billion in debt for seven office buildings in San Francisco, New York City, Boston and Jersey City. What it means for banks This is a potential problem for banks given their extensive lending to the sector. Goldman Sachs estimates that 55% of US office loans sit on bank balance sheets. Regional and community banks — already under pressure after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March — account for 23% of the total. Signature Bank had the tenth biggest portfolio of commercial real estate loans in the United States at the start of the year, according to Trepp. First Republic, which received a $30 billion lifeline last month from JPMorgan Chase and other major banks, had the ninth largest. But both had a much a greater share of their assets tied up in real estate than bigger rivals such as Wells Fargo, the leading US lender to the sector. The rise in commercial property prices over the past decade has provided developers and their bankers with a measure of protection. But pain could increase in the coming months.  About $270 billion in commercial real estate loans held by banks will come due in 2023, according to Trepp. Roughly $80 billion, nearly a third, are on office properties. Plummeting valuations will make refinancing tougher for property owners, who are likely to face requests from banks to put up more equity. Some owners — especially of older, less desirable office buildings — might decide it's not worth the expense given the market climate and simply hand back the keys. Banks may prefer that option to kickstarting drawn-out, expensive foreclosure processes. But it puts them in the difficult position of owning depreciating properties. ""That is a scenario we will see now very often,"" Christian Ulbrich, chief executive of global commercial real estate services giant Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), told CNN. The question, he continued, is what lenders will do in that situation, and whether banks are sitting on such sizable loan portfolios that they need to take ""significant losses."" Keeping watch Banks have less capacity to stomach financial blows these days. Smaller institutions are grappling with outflows of deposits to larger peers and money-market funds offering better returns. Plus, bank investments in government bonds, once considered low-risk, are notching up losses as interest rates climb. The worst outcome, according to Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, is that a ""doom loop"" develops. Questions about the health of banks with sizable exposures to commercial real estate loans cause customers to pull deposits. That forces lenders to demand repayment — exacerbating the sector's downturn and further damaging the banks' financial position. That triggers more deposit outflows in a ""vicious cycle."" That is not the central expectation right now. Since the 2008 financial crisis, banks have tightened lending standards and diversified their clientele. Loans for offices account for less than 5% of US banks' total, according to UBS. And Ulbrich of JLL said that while the speed at which borrowing costs have risen has put significant pressure on the commercial real estate industry, it has lived with rates at this level for ""most of its history."" ""There's always a risk for self-fulfilling prophecies here, but I would still be fairly optimistic things will play out in a digestible way,"" Ulbrich said. The likeliest outcome is thought to be an uptick in defaults and reduced access to funding for the commercial real estate industry. Banks, it's predicted, will weather the storm, though their earnings may take a beating. That doesn't mean, however, there won't be spillovers. ""Distress of this type has historically not only hurt the landlords and the bankers who lend to them,"" Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a note to clients this month. Non-bank lenders, related businesses and investors may also be hurt, she said.

                      India's endangered tiger population is rebounding in triumph for conservationists

                      Tigers once roamed across Asia, their numbers as high as 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, before the species plummeted to the brink of extinction. By 2006, their population in India -- home to the majority of the world's remaining wild tigers -- hit a record low of just 1,411 individuals. But decades of conservation efforts appear to have finally paid off. India's tigers have more than doubled since then, reaching 3,167 last year, according to the latest tiger census released Sunday. That's about 70% of the world's wild tiger population, which stands at around 4,500, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The resurgence of Indian tigers represents a triumph for conservationists, and a ray of hope for other countries struggling to boost wildlife numbers. The report was released alongside celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of Project Tiger, the government's conservation program launched in 1973. ""We have thousands of years of history related to tigers ... The tiger is considered our brother in many tribes,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an address on Sunday. ""A better future for humanity is only possible when our environments are protected and our biodiversity continues to expand."" Modi also visited two tiger reserves on Sunday, with photos showing the leader decked in a safari hat and camouflage clothing. Tigers in decline Tiger numbers began falling steeply in the 1940s as human populations boomed. Agricultural expansion, deforestation, and infrastructure have fragmented tiger habitats, according to the WWF -- particularly devastating given tigers are solitary animals who require large territories to roam and hunt.  Today, tigers exist on just 7% of the land they used to occupy, according to the WWF. This dwindling space has meant a rise in human-tiger conflict, with multiple incidents in the past few decades of tigers attacking humans and entering villages in search of food. And they're not alone -- India's endangered elephants, too, frequently wander into farmlands and devour crops. Though environmental degradation is a problem facing countries worldwide, India's exploding population poses a unique challenge. In 1971, the country had 547 million people; it now has 1.4 billion, and is set to overtake China to become the world's most populous country this year. Unregulated poaching in the 1980s further accelerated the decline in tiger numbers. Tigers were hunted for sport, status and consumption, with their bone and other parts often used in traditional Chinese medicine. India officially banned tiger hunting in 1972, but it remains a major threat, with illegal poaching blamed for the complete extinction of tigers within an Indian reserve in 2005. Success story Efforts to reverse the trend has seen India develop 53 tiger reserves covering nearly 75,800 square kilometers (about 7.5 million hectares), up from just nine reserves at the start of Project Tiger.  Authorities have relocated and paid entire villages to make space for tigers, and created wildlife corridors to link their fragmented habitats.  The government has also invested in technology like drones, camera traps and software systems to keep track of tiger populations, movements and behaviors. There are plenty of challenges ahead, the WWF cautioned. The worsening climate crisis spells trouble for vulnerable habitats. Many tiger reserves and protected areas are ""small islands in a vast sea of ecologically unsustainable land use,"" with human activity encroaching on tiger environments. And illegal poaching continues despite strict laws. Still, the return of the tiger population is encouraging -- and India is beginning to share its conservation practices with other countries with declining tiger numbers. In recent years, Delhi has signed bilateral agreements and launched initiatives including conservation workshops with Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Bhutan. And, as Modi pointed out in his Sunday address, similar successes are being seen with other species; India welcomed its first newborn cheetahs in March more than 70 years after the big cats were declared officially extinct in the country. The cubs were born to two rehabilitated cheetahs brought from Namibia to India, as part of a government plan to re-home 50 individuals over the next five years.

                      Tesla will open a Megapack battery factory in Shanghai, it said on Sunday, as it doubles down on its investment in China even as political tension rises between Beijing and Washington. The news was announced just days after Airbus unveiled plans for a second final-assembly line in the country's north, with officials publicly rolling out the welcome wagon for foreign investors. The Tesla factory will be able to produce 10,000 Megapacks, which are very large batteries used to store huge amounts of electricity, the company said in a tweet. It announced the new factory with a picture of a signing ceremony in China.  ""Tesla opening Megapack factory in Shanghai to supplement output of Megapack factory in California,"" Elon Musk said on Twitter. Megapacks are meant to be used as massive batteries to help stabilize energy grids. Each unit can store enough energy to power an average of 3,600 homes for one hour, the company says. They are designed for utilities and large-scale commercial projects, not vehicles. Chinese state media outlet Xinhua was the first to report the news, saying the electric automaker will break ground in this year's third quarter and begin production in the second quarter of 2024. The Shanghai facility would have the same level of production capacity as Tesla's Megafactory in Lathrop, California — equivalent to 40 gigawatt-hours of energy storage. ""We believe this announcement is a potential game changer for Tesla on the battery front,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""In this EV [electric vehicle] arms race Tesla is further building its lead in battery technology with the new Megapack factory in China another flex the muscle moment for Musk."" Last month, Apple's Tim Cook visited Beijing in show of support for the country as a market and manufacturing base amid escalating political rhetoric between the United States and China. Second Shanghai factory  The Megafactory will be located in Lingang, an enormous free trade zone on the outskirts of Shanghai, where Tesla's electric-vehicle Gigafactory broke ground in 2019. That facility was built within 10 months, at 65% of the cost of the Model 3 production plant in the United States. Within a few years, it became the biggest EV production plant on the planet. The Shanghai facility is Tesla's main export hub, supplying vehicles to most markets outside of North America. Tesla is also making inroads among Chinese drivers. Last week, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said the company sold 88,869 units of Shanghai-made EVs in March. According to Reuters, that figure was 35% higher than a year ago.  Tesla is the second largest EV maker in the country behind market leader BYD, which sold 206,089 units last month.  In January, Tesla slashed prices in China for the second time in less than three months, in an effort to boost sales as amid slowing demand in the world's largest car market. The cuts came days after Beijing ended a 13-year-long subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, a move that is expected to put further pressure on car demand. The Chinese government had planned to phase out its costly EV subsidy program by the end of 2020, but extended it during the pandemic to avert a sharp economic slowdown. For 2023, the CPCA estimates sales of ""new energy cars,"" which are mostly EVs, to reach 8.5 million units, which will account for 36% of total car sales, according to the official China Securities Journal. Total passenger cars sales in China hit 20.5 million units in 2022, up just 1.9% from the year before, the association was quoted as saying, as the country dealt with the impact of strict Zero-covid controls that were relaxed only late in the year.  — Chris Isidore and Laura He contributed to this article.

                      Wall Street says bad news is no longer good news. Here's why

                      Apr 09, 2023
                    ","
                      There's been a seismic shift in investor perspective: Bad news is no longer good news. For the past year, Wall Street has hoped for cool monthly economic data that would encourage the Federal Reserve to halt its aggressive pace of interest rate hikes to tame inflation.  But at its March meeting — just days after a series of bank failures raised concerns about the economy's stability — the central bank signaled that it plans to pause raising rates sometime this year. With an end to interest rate hikes in sight, investors have stopped attempting to guess the Fed's next move and have turned instead to the health of the economy.  This means that, whereas softening economic data used to signal good news — that the Fed could potentially stop raising rates — now, cooling economic prints simply suggest the economy is weakening. That makes investors worried that the slowing economy could fall into a recession. What happened last week? Markets teetered after a slew of economic reports signaled that the red-hot labor market is finally cooling (more on that later), flashing warning signals across Wall Street. Investors accordingly shed high-growth, large-cap stocks that have surged recently to rush into defensive stocks in industries like health care and consumer staples. While tech stocks recovered somewhat by the end of the short trading week — markets were closed in observance of Good Friday — the Nasdaq Composite still slid 1.1%. The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.1% and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%. What does this mean for markets? Now that Wall Street is in ""bad news is bad news and good news is good news"" mode, it will be looking for signs that the economy remains resilient. What hasn't changed is that investors still want to see cooling inflation data. While the central bank has signaled that it will pause hiking rates this year, its actions so far have only somewhat stabilized prices. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 5% for the 12 months ended in February — far above its 2% inflation target. Moreover, Wall Street might be overly optimistic about how the Fed will act going forward: Some investors expect the central bank to cut rates several times this year, even though the central bank indicated last month that it does not intend to lower rates in 2023. It's unclear how markets will react if the Fed doesn't cut rates this year. But there likely won't be a notable rally unless the central bank pivots or at least indicates that it plans to soon, said George Cipolloni, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. Commentary that's hawkish or reveals inflation worries could hurt markets, he adds. ""It keeps that boiling point and that temperature a little high."" What comes next? The Fed holds its next meeting in early May. Before then, it will have to parse through several economic reports to get a sense of how the economy is doing, and what it will be able to handle. Markets currently expect the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter point, according to the CME FedWatch tool.  Is the labor market cooling? The labor market appears to be cooling somewhat, at least according to the slew of data released last week. But it's still far too early to assume that the job market has lost its strength. President Joe Biden said in a statement Friday that the March data is ""a good jobs report for hard-working Americans.""  The March jobs report revealed that US employers added a lower-than-expected 236,000 jobs last month. Economists expected a net gain of 239,000 jobs for the month, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's below expectations of holding steady at 3.6%.  The jobs report was also the first one in 12 months that came in below expectations. But that doesn't mean that the job market isn't strong anymore. ""The labor market is showing signs of cooling off, but it remains very tight,"" Bank of America researchers wrote in a note Friday. Still, other data released last week help make the case that cracks are finally starting to form in the labor market. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for February revealed last week that the number of available jobs in the United States tumbled to its lowest level since May 2021. ADP's private-sector payroll report fell far short of expectations. What this means for the Fed is that the cooldown in the latest jobs report likely won't be enough for the central bank to pause rates at its next meeting. ""The Fed will more than likely raise rates in May as the labor market continues to defy the cumulative effects of the rate hikes that began over a year ago,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.

                      A highly addictive drug that became Syria's economic lifeline over a decade of isolation may now be serving as a bargaining chip as it tries to normalize ties with neighboring states, analysts say.  Captagon, a drug that is relatively unknown outside the Middle East, helped Syria turn into a narco-state after much of the international community cut off its economy due to its brutal crackdown on an uprising in 2011.   It is a synthetic amphetamine-type stimulant, fenethylline, which goes by the trade name captagon, and has become the center of an increasing number of drug busts across the Middle East. Experts say the vast majority of global captagon production occurs in Syria, with the Gulf region being its primary destination.   The growth of the industry has raised alarms in the international community. Last year, the US  introduced the 2022 US Captagon Act, which linked the trade to the Syrian regime and called it a ""transnational security threat.""   After more than a decade of boycotting him, Syria's Arab neighbors are now in talks to bring President Bashar al-Assad in from the cold. The Syrian leader has been received in some Arab capitals, but he is yet to be awarded the ultimate normalization with Saudi Arabia, one of Syria's staunchest foes -- and the biggest market for its drugs.  Following the deadly February 6 earthquake that struck southern Turkey and northern Syria, Saudi relief planes landed for the first time in a decade at regime-controlled airports. And last month, Saudi state media reported Riyadh was in talks with Damascus to resume providing consular services between the two countries.  Analysts say captagon is likely to be high on the agenda in attempts at normalization.  Saudi media has been sounding the alarm lately over the rise in drug use. In September, Saudi authorities announced the largest seizure of illicit drugs in the country's history after nearly 47 million amphetamine pills were hidden in a flour shipment and seized at a warehouse in the capital Riyadh. Millions more pills have been intercepted since. The UN says amphetamine seizures in the region refer predominantly to captagon.  ""Captagon has been touted as a 'card' in rapprochement talks between the Syrian regime and counterparts pursuing normalization,"" said Caroline Rose, director of the New Lines Institute's Project on the Captagon Trade in Washington, DC. ""The regime has been leveraging its agency over the captagon trade, signaling to states considering normalization that they could reduce captagon trafficking as a goodwill gesture,"" Rose told CNN.  Exported by several actors, including Syrian smugglers, Lebanon's Hezbollah and pro-Iranian Iraqi militias, ""the captagon smuggling is worth more than Syria's legal export,"" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC and an expert on the topic. Hezbollah has denied ties to any drug trades.  The United Kingdom, which last month imposed new sanctions on Syrians connected to the trade, said the Assad regime has benefited from the captagon trade to the tune of $57 billion. It described it as a ""financial lifeline"" for Assad that is ""worth approximately three times the combined trade of the Mexican (drug) cartels.""  Syrian state media regularly reports on captagon drug busts, saying that the interior ministry is cracking down on its trade as well as that of other narcotics.  Smugglers 'get military training' Salah Malkawi, a Jordanian analyst who follows the trade closely, says that despite Syria's denial, it is impossible for the drug to cross borders without the involvement of several actors closely tied to Assad and his regime.   ""Commanders of militias, security agencies, military forces are involved in the drug smuggling operation,"" Malkawi said. ""The drugs cannot reach these areas without passing through dozens of barriers and checkpoints that fall under the Fourth Division, which is under the leadership of Maher al-Assad, the brother of the Syrian president.""  ""I've spoken to several (smugglers),"" he said. ""They have received military training ... using war tactics ... to carry out sophisticated raids.""  The Syrian government didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.  Jordan, which supported anti-regime groups at the start of the Syrian civil war, has in recent months also been on the road to rapprochement with Assad.   Its foreign minister this year made his first visit to Damascus since the start of the Syrian civil war and has been sending humanitarian aid following the February 6 earthquake.   Jordan has been directly impacted by Syria's captagon trade due to the prevalence of its use in border regions in the northeast of the country, said Saud Al-Sharafat, a former brigadier general in the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate, as well as founder of the Shorufat ِCenter for the Study of Globalization and Terrorism in Amman, Jordan.  ""There is also the high cost of securing the borders and the increase in pressure on the armed forces and security services,"" Al-Sharafat told CNN.  He welcomed the US Captagon Act as ""the first serious international effort"" to prevent the regime from expanding its use of the drug ""to destabilize security in the region and the world."" Syria could potentially flood Europe and Western countries with the drug through Turkey and use it as a bargaining chip against them, he said.  But even if agreements are reached between Syria and its neighbors over stopping exports of the drug, experts say it is unlikely that Assad will fully abandon the trade.   ""That's asking the key trafficker to stop his business,"" Felbab-Brown said. ""It is very unlikely that the Assad regime would give up on its crucial revenue source.""  At best, he may offer cosmetic solutions to the problem, experts say, promising tighter restrictions and tougher law enforcement at home on producers and traders, whom the regime denies it is involved with.  Rose of the New Lines Institute said that the regime may maintain its captagon businesses as a form of long-term leverage against its neighbors, while maintaining ""some level of plausible deniability with the trade, blaming opposition forces and non-state actors, while undertaking a wave of cosmetic seizures at home to shift the blame away from the government.""  Nadeen Ebrahim contributed to this report.  The digest    Israeli's spy agency encouraged protests against government, leaked US report says   A leaked US intelligence report about Israel has sparked outrage in Jerusalem. The report, produced by the CIA and sourced to signals intelligence, says that Israel's main intelligence agency, the Mossad, had been encouraging protests against the country's new government -- ""including several explicit calls to action."" The Israeli Prime Minister's Office responded on the Mossad's behalf Sunday morning, calling the report ""mendacious and without any foundation whatsoever."" It added: ""The Mossad and its senior officials did not -- and do not -- encourage agency personnel to join the demonstrations against the government, political demonstrations or any political activity.""   Background: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Some of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, expose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. 
            Why it matters: Israel has faced months of protests against a controversial plan by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government to weaken the judiciary. The protests, which were supported by some elements of the military and security services, have slightly waned since Netanyahu announced a delay of the plan two weeks ago, but the country remains deeply divided on the matter.    Saudi and Omani delegations arrive in Yemen for talks with Houthi leaders  Delegations of Saudi and Omani negotiators arrived in Yemen's capital Sana'a on Saturday for talks with Houthi leaders, according to the Houthi-run news agency Saba. The Saudi and Omani delegations will meet with the head of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, Mahdi Al-Mashat, to discuss ""lifting the siege with all its repercussions, stopping the aggression, and restoring all the rightful rights of the Yemeni people, including the payment of salaries of all state employees from oil and gas revenues,"" Saba reported, citing sources. Houthi officials also said 13 prisoners released by Saudi authorities as part of a prisoner swap had arrived at Sanaa International Airport on Saturday.  Background: The talks -- involving top level officials -- are part of ongoing efforts to negotiate a permanent ceasefire agreement between Saudi Arabia and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement who have been at war in Yemen since 2015. The discussions come following a surprise Chinese-brokered rapprochement between regional arch-rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in March, which has raised hopes for an end to hostilities. 
            Why it matters: Yemen's war is seen as the main proxy battle between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Since the Saudi-led war in the country started, the Houthis have launched hundreds of missiles on Saudi Arabia and, to a lesser degree, the United Arab Emirates. A ceasefire would bring calm to Saudi Arabia's 1,300-kilometer (808-mile) border with Yemen as the kingdom focuses its effort on economic diversification.  Controversial Israeli minister joins thousands of settlers marching to illegal outpost in occupied West Bank   Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir joined thousands of Israeli settlers marching to an illegal outpost in the occupied West Bank on Monday afternoon. The rally was organized by activist groups who want to legalize the outpost at Evyatar. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas described the march as an ""invasion of settler militias, led by ministers from the Israeli occupation government,"" that ""does not change the fact that it is Palestinian land,"" according to the Palestinian News Agency WAFA.  Background: Israeli settlers left Evyatar in 2021 after a deal with the government of then-prime minister Naftali Bennett, which saw them leave on condition that the buildings would remain. Evyatar sits on a hilltop known locally as Jabal Subeih. The site is seen as strategic, a high point along a corridor linking Tel Aviv to the Jordan Valley. 
            Why it matters: With a new Israeli government now in power, the settlers are campaigning to legalize the outpost. The march comes after the United States last month summoned Israel's ambassador in Washington over the Israeli parliament's vote to roll back 2005 legislation that previously ordered the evacuation of four Israeli settleme

                      Following the Supreme Court's June 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, more than a dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to the procedure.  Nine states, including Alabama, Kentucky and Missouri, have banned abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Mississippi's near-total ban has an exception for rape but not incest. States where abortion is most limited report higher rates of maternal and infant mortality, as well as greater economic insecurity. Health care providers and abortion activists have continued to file legal challenges to stop bans in several states from being enforced. In South Carolina, the state's Supreme Court overturned a six-week ban in January 2023, concluding in a 3-2 decision that the law violated the state constitution's privacy protections. Georgia's six-week ban was blocked in November by a state court, but days later, Georgia's Supreme Court allowed the ban to go into effect while an appeal by the state plays out. The state's Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case in March, and a ruling is expected in the next six months. A district judge in Wyoming also temporarily blocked the state's new abortion ban days after it went into effect in March, meaning abortion remains legal until viability for now. As these legal challenges make their way through the courts, patients seeking access to the procedure must navigate a complicated patchwork of legislation, often requiring them to travel hundreds of miles.

                      Did this winter solve the Colorado River crisis? No -- but it took some pressure off, for now

                      Across the Southwest, the signs of a phenomenal winter are everywhere. Snow blankets the tops of the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los Angeles. And in downtown Phoenix, the Salt and Verde rivers are full.  After three years of record-breaking drought and plummeting water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, water officials and experts across the West are now looking at more snow and water than they can handle.   While many are not ready to declare the crisis on the Colorado River solved, they feel the blockbuster winter means basin states should no longer have to cut up to 25% of the basin's water usage that was called for last year by Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton, the river's top federal official.  ""We can probably create the protection levels with cuts not as big as what she described,"" Arizona's top water official Tom Buschatzke told CNN. ""I think that might help us get to the place we need to be.""  After more than a year of contentious negotiations between Arizona, California and other Western states on how exactly to distribute those cuts, Buschatzke and other officials say the wet winter has taken some of the pressure off.  On Tuesday, the Interior Department and Bureau of Reclamation are expected to release the first installment of an environmental analysis examining what different volumes of Colorado River cuts will look like for the cities, farmers and tribes who all depend on the water.   The wet winter likely won't be reflected in Reclamation's analysis, according to Bill Hasencamp, the manager of Colorado River Resources for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to Los Angeles.   ""People in the upper basin are dealing with feet and feet and feet of snow. The snowpack is still increasing,"" Hasencamp told CNN. ""It's a completely different trend than we've seen the last three years. This is definitely going to make a huge difference in the short run. But people don't want to go too far because they don't want to go back to complacency.""  Still, others are cautioning that one historic winter will only delay the inevitable pain of water cuts, as years of overuse collide with climate change-fueled droughts.  As welcome as the reprieve this winter is, if water usage isn't cut by up to 25%, ""we will crash that system,"" said Cynthia Campbell, water resources management adviser for the city of Phoenix, told CNN. ""I think we're going to come right back to that conclusion in a year -- in a very short amount of time.""  Biden administration takes water-saving action  Even with the possible short-term reprieve from this winter's snowpack, the Biden administration is readying a flurry of Colorado River announcements as it scrambles to deal with a fast-growing crisis in the Western US.  On Tuesday, the federal government's highly anticipated analysis will compare several scenarios on the Colorado River -- comparing taking no action with other water-cutting scenarios of various degrees. The Biden administration is expected to select a preferred scenario this summer.  But the administration is also hoping to incentivize water cuts by paying cities, tribes and farmers to reduce water use for the next few years.   Last week, administration officials announced the first deal it signed in a series of short-term agreements to fallow farmland and keep more water in Lake Mead. The Gila River Indian Community in Arizona promised to conserve 125,000 acre-feet -- about 40 billion gallons -- of Colorado River water for the next three years. In exchange, the federal government agreed to pay for $233 million worth of water infrastructure and conservation projects for the tribe.  At a news conference at Arizona's state capital on Thursday, Deputy Interior Secretary Tommy Beaudreau told reporters more fallowing agreements would be coming soon.   ""What you're going to see in the coming months are additional announcements of deploying and awarding [federal] funding to communities throughout the basin in order to conserve water,"" Beaudreau said -- adding funding would also go to longer-term projects to cut water use in the West, such as water recycling and drip irrigation. ""You're going to see a steady drumbeat of that.""  Federal and state officials are hoping that the short-term payments to let agricultural fields go dry could add 10 additional feet of elevation in Lake Mead -- the Colorado River's largest reservoir and the largest reservoir in the country overall.   But whether 10 feet is achievable remains to be seen; many of these agreements have yet to be signed and are flexible enough to give farmers and cities the chance to back out if dry conditions return and they need the water, one source familiar with the agreements told CNN.   Tougher water fights to come The 25% cuts Touton called for last year spurred a tough series of state negotiations that yielded little consensus. Sticking points have included whether the senior priority rights that protect California and Arizona farmers and tribes from cuts should remain intact.   Stakeholders around the basin are expecting more tough negotiations to take place in 2026, when the current guidelines that govern how the river is managed are set to expire.  Many state water negotiators are breathing a sigh of relief the wet winter and short-term fallowing agreements are coinciding this year.   ""What we expect that means is that Lake Powell and Lake Mead will balance,"" Brenda Burman, general manager of the Central Arizona Project and former Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, told CNN. ""That helps with what type of shortage we might have next year, that helps as far as where we think the reservoirs might be in two to three years, so it's very good news.""  Still, Burman cautioned that since 2000, the Colorado River hasn't seen two years of good hydrology in a row -- meaning celebrations could be short-lived.  ""Even though this year is looking like a very good year for runoff; one, we haven't seen it yet, and two, we don't know what will happen next year,"" Burman said.  Along the Colorado River, all eyes are on the federal government's forthcoming announcement of what different water cut scenarios could look like. In the meantime, Colorado Basin state negotiators are starting to look more toward 2026, increasingly confident the good year of winter and water will help them avoid dire cuts in the short-term.   ""We don't want to be fighting over the short term and miss the real prize, which is the long term,"" Hasencamp told CNN.   One outside expert watching negotiations told CNN the talk about not having to make hard choices now is concerning, given how close the river has already come to crashing.  ""Perhaps more worrisome is the fact it buys us time,"" said Sarah Porter, the director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. ""We have already come very close to minimum power pool and we're now able to say the words dead pool. We need a negotiated agreement or a federal action to get us out of this zone.""

According to satellite data, the size of the plume cloud measures 400 by 250 kilometers and has spread to the west and south of the volcano, the Geophysical Survey said.  The Institute of Volcanology and Seismology of the Far Eastern Branch of RAS said a ""red"" hazard designation, the highest level, has been issued for aviation and that there is a risk of hot lava flows blocking roads, Russian state news agency TASS reported.  ""Molten lava flows can travel up to 20 kilometers and block the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky-Ust-Kamchatsky highway,"" the institute said, according to TASS.

                      Contract negotiations between Rutgers University and 3 unions representing thousands of faculty and staff continue amid historic strike

                      Three unions representing about 9,000 Rutgers University faculty and staff have gone on strike after nearly a year of gridlocked contract negotiations, marking the first educator strike in the university's nearly 257-year history, according to the unions.  Picket lines are expected to continue Tuesday on Rutgers's three main campuses in New Brunswick, Newark and Camden, New Jersey, to demand salary increases, improved job security for adjunct faculty and guaranteed funding for graduate students, among other requests. After New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy implored the two parties to meet in his office Monday for a ""productive dialogue,"" representatives for the governor's office, university and unions met around noon Monday and were still engaged in negotiations late Monday night, according to Alan Maass, a spokesperson for the union Rutgers AAUP-AFT. In response to a question about raising tuition to support contract demands, Murphy said during a Monday press conference that he would not be a fan of a deal ""that takes it out on the back of the students.""   ""I'm not happy it's gotten to this point. I said this to them -- both sides,"" the governor said, noting he is optimistic that all parties will reach a fair resolution.  Union leaders expected the action to halt instruction and ""non-critical research,"" as clinicians at the university's health facilities ""will continue to perform patient care duties and critical research, while curbing voluntary work,"" the unions' release said.  Still, the university has insisted classes will proceed. ""The university is open and operating, and classes are proceeding on a normal schedule,"" the school's website read late Monday, though another page noted: ""Many classes will continue to meet during the strike."" In guidelines posted in case of a strike, the university advised students to continue to attend classes and complete assignments as normal. It also stressed ""it is the university's expectation that all faculty and staff continue to report to work in order to fulfill their job duties and responsibilities."" The unions' action comes just weeks after a massive three-day strike by Los Angeles public school workers demanding increased wages and better working conditions and amid a surge of short-term worker strikes nationwide.  It is unclear how long the strike at Rutgers will last.  The university said it may seek a court injunction to end the strike and ""compel a return to normal activities,"" though union leaders have strongly resisted the university's claims that the strike is illegal.   ""To say that this is deeply disappointing would be an understatement,"" Rutgers University President Jonathan Holloway said in a letter to the community, noting the two sides agreed to appoint a mediator just two days before the strike was announced.  ""For the past several weeks, negotiations have been constant and continuous,"" the president said. ""Significant and substantial progress has been made, as I have noted, and I believe that there are only a few outstanding issues. We will, of course, negotiate for as long as it takes to reach agreements and will not engage in personal attacks or misinformation."" Union representatives, however, insist the university has refused to meet their central demands.  ""After sitting at the bargaining table for 10 months trying to win what we believe to be fair and reasonable things, like fair pay, job security, and access to affordable health care, and getting virtually nowhere on these core demands, we had no choice but to vote to strike,"" Amy Higer, a part-time lecturer at Rutgers and president of the Adjunct Faculty Union, said in a statement. ""We've heard management say that a strike will harm students,"" she continued. ""But you know what really harms students? The high turnover that results from paying teachers poorly and making them reapply for their jobs every semester."" The striking unions are Rutgers AAUP-AFT, which represents full-time faculty, graduate workers, postdoctoral researchers and counselors; the Rutgers Adjunct Faculty Union, which represents part-time lecturers; and AAUP-BHSNJ, which represents faculty who teach at the university's medical and public health facilities. Nine other unions are seeking new contracts with the university, according to the unions' release.  Where negotiations stand  The unions and university representatives have been negotiating since the prior contracts expired last summer, the unions' release said. But while both sides acknowledged some progress in recent days, union leadership said Sunday that their essential demands were still far from being met.  Rutgers AAUP-AFT and AAUP-BHSNJ have united their bargaining efforts and are jointly negotiating a single contract for all full-time university faculty, while the Adjunct Faculty Union is independently negotiating a new contract for part-time lecturers who must be reappointed to their teaching positions after a set number of semesters or years.  Here are some of the unions' demands: AAUP-AFT and AAUP-BHSNJ • A university-sponsored affordable housing program and freeze of campus housing rates  • Salary increases for full-time faculty, graduate and postdoctoral workers   • Increased protections for immigrant and international workers  • Up to five years of guaranteed funding for graduate workers  • Child care subsidies for graduate and postdoctoral workers  • More paths to teaching tenure for professors and librarians  Adjunct Faculty Union • Health care eligibility for members who teach 50% of the full-time equivalent  • Longer-term contracts and more advance notification of appointments  • Caps on size of writing-intensive classes   • Promotions based on years of service  In response, Holloway said the university has offered, in part: • 12% salary increases for full-time faculty by July 2025 • Approximately 20% increase in per-credit salary rate for part-time lecturers • More than 20% increase in minimum salary for postdoctoral fellows and associates over the contract period • Commitment to ""multi-year university support"" for teaching and graduate assistants ""To say it's just about wages is an understatement,"" O'Malley, the masters student, said Sunday. ""This fight is the fight between our university's mission, between its promises and its reality. This is why this fight is central to students and community."" University threatens legal action  Faced with a possible strike, Holloway said in a letter last week that the action would leave leadership with ""no choice but to make every legal effort to ensure that any job action does not affect our students' academic progress."" In its posted strike guidance for faculty, staff and students, Rutgers said it would consider seeking a court injunction to force a return to instruction and work.  ""The university may go to court to maintain university operations and protect our students, patients, and staff from disruptions to their education, clinical care, and workplace,"" the guidance said.  The university and union leaders are at odds over the legality of the strike, as Rutgers has warned its workers that it would be illegal for them to participate in the action as public employees. In a note advising participants on their ""right to strike,"" the unions pushed back on the university's claim, saying, ""The NJ Constitution and statutes are silent about whether strikes by public-sector workers are legal. In some instances, courts have issued injunctions against striking public employees."" If Rutgers administrators do petition a court for an injunction, the unions said, ""It would signal the start, and not the end, of a legal process.""

                      China appears to simulate first aircraft carrier strike on Taiwan

                      For the first time, the Chinese navy appears to have simulated strikes by aircraft carrier-based warplanes on Taiwan, as drills around the island wrapped up on their third day. Beijing launched the drills on Saturday, a day after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen returned from a 10-day visit to Central America and the United States where she met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.  Taiwan's Ministry of Defense reported on Monday that during the past 24 hours four J-15 fighter jets had crossed into the southeastern portion of the island's air defense identification zone -- a self-declared buffer that extends beyond the island's airspace. The J-15 is the version of J-11 twin-jet fighter that was developed for use on Beijing's growing fleet of aircraft carriers. A CNN review of Taiwan Defense Ministry records shows it to be the first time the J-15s have crossed into Taiwan's air defense identification zone.  Meanwhile, the Japan Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed in a press release that Japanese forces had observed 80 fixed-wing aircraft take-offs and landings during the Chinese exercises from the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong, which was in the Pacific Ocean east of Taiwan and about 230 kilometers (143 miles) south of the Japanese island of Miyako in Okinawa prefecture. Japan scrambled Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets in response, the Joint Chiefs said. The J-15 flights were among 35 People's Liberation Army (PLA) aircraft that had either crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait or entered the islands air defense identification zon in the 24 hours ending at 6 a.m. Taiwan time on Monday, according to the island's Defense Ministry. It also said 11 PLA Navy vessels were in the waters around Taiwan, without specifying their distances from the island. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday that the Eastern Theater Command of the PLA was continuing military drills around Taiwan as part of its Operation Joint Sword that began two days earlier.  Monday's drills focused on practicing ""maritime blockades"" and ""targeted ambush assaults on enemy mooring vessels"" in the Taiwan Strait, as well as northwest, southwest and waters east of Taiwan, CCTV reported. Over the weekend, multiple PLA services had carried out ""simulated joint precision strikes on key targets on Taiwan Island"" and in the surrounding waters, CCTV reported. It said in a statement later it had completed the military exercises and ""comprehensively tested joint combat capabilities of its integrated military forces under actual combat situation."" ""Forces in the command is ready for combat at all times, and will resolutely destroy any type of 'Taiwan independence' separatist or foreign interference attempts,"" the statement added.  China's ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory despite never having ruled it, and has spent decades trying to isolate it diplomatically. It has not ruled out using force to take control of the island. Analyst Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center, said the PLA was ""practicing and probably refining the aerial coordination and joint operations required to initiate a blockade of Taiwan's ports and air lanes."" A Chinese blockade of Taiwan could choke off supplies coming into the island, including any military aid or other shipments from the United States or its partners. The US, through the Taiwan Relations Act, is legally obligated to provide Taiwan with defensive weaponry, but it remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attempted Chinese attack. Beijing had repeatedly warned against Tsai's meeting with McCarthy and threatened to take ""strong and resolute measures"" if it went ahead. After the drills commenced, Beijing described them as ""a serious warning against the Taiwan separatist forces' collusion with external forces, and a necessary move to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Taiwan Defense Ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang said the PLA's exercises had ""destabilized"" the region. ""President Tsai's visit became their excuse to conduct exercises and their actions have severely jeopardized the security of the surrounding region,"" he said, adding that the island's air defense units were on ""high alert."" Beijing conducted similar large-scale military exercises around Taiwan last August, after then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the island. Those exercises included Chinese missile launches over the island, something that has not been seen so far in the current drills. But Schuster said this weekend's exercises ""are simply extensions and expansions from the August exercise."" ""The tactical complexity is greater than last year's, but operationally this exercise seems simpler,"" he said. And the Communist Party's message remains constant, Schuster said. ""As is always the case with PLA exercises in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea areas, Beijing is telling the US, regional countries, Taiwan and its own people, that the PLA has the capability to conduct blockade and joint air and missile strikes on targets in and around Taiwan,"" he said.

                      Record warmth in areas with a record snowpack may cause hazardous flooding this week

                      This week will be draining in a literal sense, due to rapid snowmelt. A great thaw is set to begin, which will bring the potential for flooding across at least 10 states. From the West Coast to the Great Lakes, concern is growing about the significant warmup forecast this week and what impact it will have on the near-record snowpack for many regions. ""Between 5,000 feet and 7,000 feet snowpack is currently near to above record levels, with 8 to 15 inches of water contained within this snow,"" the National Weather Service office in Billings explained. Record highs are possible across the Northern Plains and Midwest this week, as temperatures climb into the 60s and 70s. The sudden warmth combined with heavy rain from an approaching cold front could lead to rapid snowmelt, causing rivers and creeks to flood quickly; something forecasters have been expecting with this year's blockbuster winter snowpack. ""Minneapolis had their third-snowiest winter on record, so a lot of it was sitting around waiting to melt,"" Eric Ahasic, a weather service meteorologist in Twin Cities, said. ""We didn't really add a ton of heavy rain on top of the snowpack while that snow was melting, so that kind of allowed it to progress fairly orderly, but we're going to have some minor flooding in a lot of rivers."" He explained the perfect ingredients will exist this week for a rapid melt: warm temperatures, humid air, windy conditions and a strong sun angle. Ahasic fears areas to his north will have a much more difficult time with all this melting snow. North Dakota and Minnesota could see more significant flooding where the rivers flow to the north. ""As that water flows into the Red River, and then flows north up into Canada, it's going to run into colder weather and even some ice farther north,"" Ahasic explained. ""That's why you usually get some really bad flooding up across that part of the United States and Canada, because the water that's flowing is running into usually some sort of ice blockage."" The blockages are often referred to as ice jams, which happen when huge chunks of ice clump together and block the flow of the river, which many times results in rapid flooding. In portions of the Northern Plains, temperatures could climb to 80 degrees this week, possibly setting records. Any snow left on the ground will melt quickly with temperatures running at least 15 degrees above normal. ""With the ground mainly frozen in the foothills, this water will not be able to soak in and will run off,"" the weather service in Billings said. ""Water flowing downhill and accumulating in low-lying areas may result in localized flooding."" The weather service urges people to stay up to date with the flooding situation over the next few weeks, in case any rivers begin to rapidly rise. In portions of the southern Sierra, the rate of melting snow will also begin to rapidly increase this week, causing rivers to rise and run more swiftly. The weather service warns people to stay vigilant in the lower elevations and campsites, because of the potential for flash flooding. ""Due to their swift currents and very cold-water temperatures, creeks and streams pose life-threatening dangers,"" the weather service office in Las Vegas warned. While the snow is beginning to melt more quickly this week, it will be something to follow for the next several weeks and even months.

                      A severe sandstorm has cloaked Beijing and China's northeastern regions for the fourth time in a month forcing some residents to stay indoors to protect themselves from dense air pollution. Images showed the Chinese capital engulfed in a cloud of orange haze on Monday which hung thick in the air into Tuesday, though conditions have begun to ease. Beijing authorities told children and the elderly to stay indoors, and healthy adults were advised to refrain from outdoor activity. Residents were also reminded to keep their windows shut and wear masks and face shields. On Monday, the air quality index soared to ""severely polluted"" levels, according to Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.  Concentrations of PM10 particles exceeded 1,321 micrograms per cubic meter at 9 p.m. on Monday, according to the center -- almost 30 times the daily average guideline of 45 micrograms per cubic meter set by the World Health Organization.  PM10 are particles of pollution that are less than 10 micrometers in diameter and can irritate your eyes and nose and travel to your lungs.  Even smaller particles referred to as PM2.5 can travel deeper into your lungs and potentially enter your bloodstream. Levels of PM2.5 have been ""hazardous"" in Beijing for some of the past 48 hours, according to the Air Quality Index, which monitors real-time air quality in major cities worldwide. Beijing is regularly hit with sandstorms in the spring with the smog made worse by rising industrial activity and rapid deforestation throughout northern China. The latest sandstorm is the fourth to hit the country since March 10, and the eighth since the start of the year, state media reported. The most severe sandstorm so far this year occurred on March 22, when PM10 particles hit 1,667 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the Beijing Municipal Ecological and Environmental Monitoring Center.   This time, the affected areas stretched as far south as Shanghai to parts of Heilongjiang, the country's northernmost province, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. Other areas affected included Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia,  Shanxi, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui and Hubei, according to the national observatory.  China's National and Grassland Administration said sand and dust from the southern part of Mongolia and the western part of Inner Mongolia were carried southeast by air currents, triggering the present storm.  One Chinese internet user on Weibo, China's heavily censored equivalent of Twitter, complained about the pungent smell.  ""It smells very earthy,"" she said.  Another user compared the storm to the sci-fi film ""Blade Runner"" and urged others to ""just wear protection"" when going out.

                      Amid many pressing political duties, the Biden administration will make time today for an annual tradition dating to the 1870s: the White House Easter Egg Roll. About 30,000 visitors are expected to converge on the South Lawn for family-friendly activities centered around the theme of ""EGGucation."" Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get ""CNN's 5 Things"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Document leaks The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the leaks of a trove of apparent US intelligence documents that were posted on social media in recent weeks. The documents have revealed the US' efforts in spying on Russia, while also exposing the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. The documents appeared last month on the social media platform Discord and revealed sensitive and highly classified material, officials said. They also divulged weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry -- reportedly forcing the country's military to alter some plans as fighting continues in the country's eastern region. The Pentagon has initiated an ""interagency effort"" to determine the source of the leaks and assess their impact, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Sunday. 2. Mosque stabbing An imam is in stable condition after being stabbed during a Sunday morning prayer service at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, according to local officials. The suspect, who was unknown to congregants, was performing prayers at Omar Mosque when he lunged forward with a knife at the imam. After stabbing him multiple times, the suspect attempted to flee but the congregants ""were able to bring him down and apprehend him and hold him"" until police arrived and arrested him, a spokesperson for the mosque told CNN. There were more than 200 congregants in the mosque at the time of the stabbing, the spokesperson said, adding he believes that this was an isolated incident. The stabbing occurred during Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2023, it runs from March 22 to April 20. 3. Abortion Two federal court rulings over abortion access are creating a chaotic legal flashpoint that will be closely watched this week. In one case filed by anti-abortion activists in Texas, a judge said the FDA's approval more than 20 years ago of mifepristone -- one of the drugs used to terminate a pregnancy -- should be halted. But the court paused its ruling for a week so that it can be appealed. In the second case, where Democratic-led states had sued in Washington to expand access to abortion pills, a judge ordered the federal government to keep the drug available in the 17 states, plus the District of Columbia. ""Everything is on the table,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told CNN on Sunday, emphasizing the Biden administration is considering all options to protect access to the procedure.  4. Electric vehicles The EPA is preparing to release strict vehicle emissions standards for light-duty vehicles that, if implemented, would move the US car market decisively toward electric vehicles over the next decade. By 2032, the new emissions standards would ensure that 64% to 67% of all new-car sales in the US would be electric vehicles, according to a source familiar with the proposal. The EPA's expected move comes after California air regulators voted last year to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and set interim targets to phase these cars out. Experts say this is a major step toward zero-emissions vehicles as the US tries to keep up with other countries racing toward EV adoption. The new rules could come as soon as Wednesday. 5. Masters Jon Rahm won the 2023 Masters Tournament on Sunday at Augusta National Golf Club, clinching his first green jacket and second career major. The Spaniard's impressive victory saw him leapfrog reigning Masters champion Scottie Scheffler as world No. 1. Rahm put on a clinic in consistency to ease to a four-shot victory ahead of LIV Golf Series duo Brooks Koepka and Phil Mickelson. Fifteen-time major champion Tiger Woods announced his withdrawal due to injury hours before play resumed on Sunday after visibly struggling with movement throughout the weekend. Ultimately, Rahm carded a final round three-under 69 to finish 12-under. He became the fourth Spaniard to win the green jacket and the first European golfer to win both The Masters and the US Open.

                      More than three months after Patrick Holland's first shot at getting a heart transplant was ruined by winter weather that upended his travel and prevented him from getting to the Washington state hospital in time, the Alaska man has been given a second chance.  The father of seven is among the thousands of people in the Pacific Northwest whose flights were canceled or redirected in December as severe storms swept through the region. But even after his airline jumped through hoops to reschedule Holland on subsequent flights, they were all canceled. The heart transplant was given to somebody else.  Determined to not miss his next opportunity, Holland temporarily relocated from his home near Fairbanks to live near the transplant hospital in Seattle so he could be available at a moment's notice. There, he was staying with a family who heard about his story on the news.  In the passing months, a few hearts became available for Holland, who has congestive heart failure, but none of them was viable.  Finally, a fifth call came last week alerting Holland to a potential transplant, and everything fell into place. ""It really didn't feel real until he told me, 'They told me I have like 20 minutes to say goodbye because we're going in for intubation,' and then a nurse came into the room, and he had to hang up,"" Holland's wife, Haley Holland, told CNN. When her husband called back, the couple had just seconds to speak before he had to go again. ""I barely had time to tell him that I loved him,"" said Holland, who has been documenting the family's transplant journey on Facebook. She and her children flew to Seattle to be with Patrick after the surgery last Friday. Haley Holland has been giving each potential donor, whose names are not typically shared with their organ recipients, an imagined name of her own.  Her husband is now recovering at the University of Washington Medical Center with a heart transplant from the donor she has dubbed ""Andrew.""  ""Number five --  Andrew, as we affectionately call this donor unless we become blessed enough to find out his true name -- was the perfect one,"" Haley Holland wrote in a Facebook post. In the days since the transplant, Haley Holland has felt and listened to her husband's new heartbeat. ""It feels like a miracle,"" she told CNN, adding that with the help of a nurse, she first felt her husband's new heartbeat through a pulse on his foot. On Saturday, she used a stethoscope to hear the beating.  ""It just makes you cry because this isn't the heart that he was born with. It's not the heart that he spent 57 years with. This is someone else's heart. And so it's very touching and it's miraculous that Patrick now has this new heart that he'll be able to enjoy life with."" Though the surgery was successful, Patrick Holland's recovery is just beginning. In a Tuesday Facebook update, his wife said he has been able to stand but still has uncomfortable IV ports and extreme he nausea that is making eating difficult. By Thursday, Holland was progressing in his recovery, according to Dr. Claudius Mahr, his cardiologist at the UW Medicine Heart Institute. ""He's pretty much progressing as one would expect,"" Mahr told CNN. ""There's always a few bumps in the road with surgeries like this, but he's generally trending in the right direction.""   Mahr said Alaska is one of several states without a heart transplant program, and patients often come to Washington for care. Doctors at the UW Medicine perform among the highest volume of heart transplants in the country, according to the hospital's website.  Following the surgery, Haley Holland created a GoFundMe to support the family's expenses. Her thoughts have also been with his heart donor. ""Remembering that this is Andrew's heart and that someone had to pay the ultimate price,"" she said. ""Someone had to wmake an enormous sacrifice in order for this miracle to happen. So, it's a very emotional thing, feeling the pulse or listening to the heart."" Patrick Holland told CNN in December that he had a ""massive heart attack at 29"" followed by a series of heart-related complications. He said he dreamed of keeping up with his children, who then ranged in age from 3 to 36.  Following the transplant, Haley Holland said her husband is thankful. ""Even in the worst times he will look at me and he'll say, 'It was worth it,'"" she said. As of January, 3,365 patients were on the waiting list for a heart nationwide, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. Mahr urged people to become organ donors. ""You can save multiple people's lives.""  Correction: A previous version of this story mischaracterized the volume of heart transplants UW Medicine performs. It is among the highest in the US.

                      An imam is in stable condition after being stabbed during a Sunday morning prayer service at a mosque in Paterson, New Jersey, according to local officials. Imam Sayed Elnakib was stabbed during the first prayer of the day, around 5:30 a.m., at Omar Mosque in south Paterson while the congregation was kneeling for prayer, mosque spokesperson Abdul Hamdan told CNN.  The suspect, who was unknown to congregants prior to Sunday's incident, was performing prayers and ""lunged forward with a knife and stabbed Imam Sayed multiple times -- at least twice,"" Hamdan said. After the incident, the suspect attempted to flee from the mosque but congregants ""were able to bring him down and apprehend him and hold him"" until police arrived and arrested him, he said. There were more than 200 congregants in the mosque at the time of the stabbing, Hamdan said. The spokesperson said he strongly believes that this was an isolated incident and assured all congregants ""that the mosque is safe and to practice their faith, it is open."" Mayor Andre Sayegh said he visited Imam Sayed Elnakib in the hospital soon after the incident. The mayor said the imam is in stable condition at St. Joseph's University Medical Center.  CNN has contacted the medical center and did not receive an immediate response. Sayegh said Elnakib was ""in better spirits than before"" Sunday afternoon and is being treated for a punctured lung. The mayor said a suspect was detained, but their motive is not clear. The stabbing occurred during Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar. In 2023, it runs from March 22 to April 20.  In a news conference Sunday, Sayegh commended the efforts of worshipers who apprehended the attacker and announced that there would be increased police presence at Paterson mosques. ""We appreciate the efforts of those here who were able to apprehend the assailant and we also want to reassure the family, the congregation at the mosque, that there will be extra police attention,"" the mayor said.  ""This is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar year and we want to make sure that the safety of those that are just coming to pray is a priority for us and that we take this situation very seriously,"" he continued. ""We want to let anyone who is coming to worship know that they can do this in peace without any fear of being attacked."" The Paterson Police Department was taken over by the state attorney general's office in late March, due to a ""crisis of confidence"" in the city's law enforcement, the office said at the time. The attorney general's office told CNN the stabbing is being investigated by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office for further details. Councilman Al Abdel-aziz, who represents the area where the attack happened, said in a Facebook update that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the stabbing. ""My heart goes out to everyone affected by this tragic event,"" he said. ""While it is unclear what motivated the attacker, there is no justification for violence of any kind, especially in a sacred space."" ""I am relieved to hear that Imam Sayed Elnakib is in stable condition, and wish him a full and speedy recovery,"" the councilman added. ""Please know that my thoughts and prayers are with him and his family during this difficult time. As a community, it is important that we come together to support one another and denounce all forms of hate and violence."" A day earlier, the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for a hate crime investigation after a separate incident in Paterson. The chapter said a sign at the Dr. Hani Awadallah public school in Paterson was defaced. In a statement Saturday, the chapter's executive director. Selaedin Maksut, said, ""While the circumstances surrounding the incident remain unknown, the smearing of the word 'Allah' in Dr. Awadallah's name is apparently intentional, with the remainder of the sign left untouched, making an immediate hate crime investigation into this incident necessary."" ""In 2022, we've recorded the highest number of complaints of anti-Muslim prejudices, at 152,"" Maksut said. ""Over the years, our records have shown that complaints increase around and during Ramadan, in part because Muslims are more visible and take up more space -- physically and metaphorically.""  During the month of Ramadan, worshipers eat and hydrate before sunrise and fast until sunset. Worshipers also engage in other forms of practice including increased prayer, giving more to charity, volunteering and participating in communal meals. Paterson is a city with a population of more than 150,000, according to the US Census Bureau, about 15 miles north of Newark.  The city is home to one of the largest Muslim communities in the state of New Jersey and that New Jersey has more Muslims per capita than any other state in the nation, according to Maksut. Later Sunday, Hamdan performed the second prayer of the day at Omar Mosque, he said, along with 300 to 400 other worshipers. Prayers will continue throughout Sunday and moving forward, the spokesperson added. ""We urge everyone to allow this incident to even get them closer to their religion, to God, to visit the congregation more often and not allow this to bring them away,"" Hamdan said. ""This is a time of unity and peace, and this incident should not in any way take that away from us. We feel safe here at the mosque.""

""You think this is a game to me. I served hard time. And I survived,"" the younger Mysterio said. The ad then cuts to photos of prisons, one of which was Auschwitz, where Nazis murdered over 1 million people. ""We had no knowledge of what was depicted,"" the WWE said in a statement to CNN.

In later airings and reruns of the first night of WrestleMania, the footage showed an image of barbed wire. WWE is known for its outlandish storylines. In this father-son rivalry, Dominik eventually turned on Rey, culminating in an altercation on Christmas Eve. The gag was that though Dominik only spent a few hours in prison, he took on a hardened criminal persona.  Rey beat Dominik on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles to ""teach him a lesson about respect.""  WWE said WrestleMania 39 was the most successful and highest-grossing event in company history, with over 500 million views and 11 million hours of video consumed over the two days.

                      The latest on hybrid work: Who is WFH and who isn't

                      As the economy slows, are employers starting to regain the upper hand in negotiations with employees and job seekers? Pay is always an issue, of course, but in the wake of the pandemic, so too is how much time employers want people to work on site versus how much they are willing to let employees work remotely.  Recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 27.5% of private-sector businesses reported that their employees worked from home or another remote location some or all of the time between August 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022.  In other words, 72.5% of private-sector organizations — up from 60% in the July-to-September 2021 period — said they did not have employees working remotely. That percentage struck work-from-home researchers and observers as surprisingly high, given what other studies and surveys have found. (More on those in a minute.) Private sector businesses employ a majority of US workers and, according to the Pew Research Center, 61% of workers do not have jobs that can be done remotely. But it's worth noting that the BLS findings did not measure teleworking arrangements at federal, state and local government employers, at nonprofit organizations or among the self-employed. The BLS survey also interpreted respondents' answers as referring to a company's formal telework policies, not whether some employees informally work remotely on occasion, such as responding to work emails from home.  ""To the extent that 'work from home' would include an individual who checks their email after hours, we purposefully did not want to capture that type of informal work activity in the estimates as this would likely be included in the 'rarely or never' category,"" a BLS spokesperson said in an email to CNN.  What others have found  Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom said he finds it hard to infer much from the BLS's 72.5% finding, because he contends respondents must have misread the survey's very first question, which said, ""Do any employees at this location currently telework in any amount?"" In his view, ""any amount"" includes answering work emails or taking a work call from home.  Semantic concerns aside, however, the confusion and surprise over the BLS finding is a reminder that there is still no standard or easy way to measure the full extent of remote work in a post-pandemic world. Other surveys and studies of people who work for all employers — not just those in the private sector — suggest telework for those whose jobs can be done remotely remains common in this post-pandemic period.  The Pew Research Center, for instance, found in a nationally representative survey of US full-time working adults conducted in February that 41% of workers with jobs that can be done from home are now working a hybrid schedule. That is up from 35% in January of last year. Among hybrid workers who are not self-employed, 63% said their employer requires them to come into the workplace with some regularity; 59% say they typically work from home three or more days a week.  That suggests the push by top employers — such as Disney, Amazon, Apple, as well as several Wall Street banks — to get employees back into the office three or more days a week may not have moved the needle much.  Meanwhile, Kastle Systems, which operates card-swipe security machines in office buildings across the United States, said that the weekly average office occupancy rate at the end of March in the most populous U.S. cities was 49% of pre-pandemic levels. While that's much higher than the occupancy rates recorded during the height of the pandemic, it's still a very long way from occupancy rates recorded back in February 2020 just before the pandemic hit. The latest results from the monthly Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA), which Bloom and other researchers have conducted since May 2020, found that the overall average number of paid days worked from home in 2023 so far is 1.4 per week (or 28% of the workweek). That's based on responses from Americans aged 20 to 64 who earned $10,000 or more the prior year.  The same survey respondents said their employers plan to allow employees to work remotely 2.2 days a week, for those who can. That's up from the 1.6 days expected back in August 2020, although below the expected 2.4 days recorded in June 2022. SWAA found that working from home is most prevalent in cities and in sectors like technology and information, finance and insurance, and professional and business services. That is somewhat similar to the BLS finding that telework is most common in the following industries: information, professional and business services, educational services and wholesale trade.  Hybrid is here to stay, but fully remote work is declining Remote work experts strongly assert hybrid schedules will remain a permanent feature of work in the United States for a host of reasons — including better worker engagement and retention — even if the parameters and kinks are still being worked out in real time. ""Companies are still trying to figure it out,"" said Sara Sutton, CEO of remote-work jobs platform FlexJobs, which she founded 16 years ago. But, Sutton added, ""Hybrid is where things will settle."" When it comes to the overall average of how often employers are likely to let employees work from home, Bloom believes it will be 25% of the week. ""I have talked to hundreds of organizations about WFH [working from home] over the past three weeks, and this is now clearly stabilizing to a post-pandemic norm,"" he said in an email. Fully remote jobs, meanwhile, will remain but may become less prevalent than they have been of late. In Pew's February survey, 35% of people who could work remotely were doing so full time, down from 55% in October 2020, but still well above the 7% of people working remotely full-time before the pandemic.

                      The city without TikTok offers a window to America's potential future

                      Across the United States, more than 150 million people are being faced with the possibility of a new reality: life without TikTok. The wildly popular short-form video app has been at the center of an ongoing battle, with lawmakers calling for an outright ban, and the company portraying itself as a critical community space, educational platform and just plain fun.  In Hong Kong, there's no need to imagine that reality: TikTok discontinued its services there in 2020. Its abrupt departure was met with mixed reactions: disappointment from some users and content creators, but also relief from others who say life is better without the app's infinite scroll. At the time of its exit, TikTok had a relatively modest presence in the city and was not ubiquitous like it is in the US today. But the varied reactions to its departure, and the way users have pivoted to other platforms or even real-life offline communities, offer Americans a glimpse into their potential TikTok-less future. Lost opportunities TikTok announced its exit from Hong Kong in July 2020, a week after China imposed a controversial national security law in the city. The decision came as the app tried to distance itself from China and its Beijing-based parent company ByteDance, in the face of growing pressure in the US under the Trump administration. But it meant a jarring halt for creators like Shivani Dukhande, who had roughly 45,000 followers at the time the app left Hong Kong. Dukhande, 25, saw her account take off in early 2020 during the pandemic, with lifestyle content such as cooking and wellness videos flourishing on the platform. ""There were a lot of new creators emerging,"" she said. ""We used to all collaborate together, we had a [group] chat where we would all speak and share ideas and it created a community."" Momentum began to build. Companies started reaching out to Dukhande, paying for sponsored content and collaborating on ad campaigns. Brands began partnering with creators on trending ""challenges"" in a bid to attract young new consumers. ""More people were joining and it was becoming such a fun thing to do,"" she said. ""Then, it just kind of went away one morning."" ""If it continued, then I probably could have made enough to have quit my 9 to 5,"" she said. ""If I had the chance to grow, it could have been a potential career path."" This is one of the main arguments TikTok has made in recent weeks in the US. In March, as the company's CEO prepared to testify before Congress, TikTok produced a docuseries highlighting American small business owners who rely on the platform for their livelihoods. The platform is used by nearly five million businesses in the US, TikTok said in March. And it's set to surpass rivals: London-based research firm Omdia projected in November that TikTok's advertising revenues will exceed the combined video ad revenues of Meta -- home of Facebook and Instagram -- and YouTube by 2027. This is partly because people are spending more time on TikTok. In the second quarter of 2022, TikTok users globally spent an average of 95 minutes per day on the app, according to data analytics firm SensorTower -- nearly twice as much time as users spent on Facebook and Instagram. But in Hong Kong, other platforms have jumped in to fill the gap. Reels, Instagram's short-form video product, with similar features as TikTok such as an endless scroll, is growing quickly -- and Dukhande has gotten on board.  She had to rebuild her audience from scratch, and now has 12,500 Instagram followers, but she feels optimistic about its growth. Still, the loss of TikTok was a ""missed opportunity,"" she said, and the burgeoning community of creators has largely faded from sight. ""The amount of jobs, the amount of content creation, the amount of marketing opportunities that were there with TikTok -- we sort of missed out on that whole chunk of it."" Are the kids alright? But for some people, TikTok's departure was a welcome change. Poppy Anderson, 16, has been using TikTok since its launch in 2018. And, like many others in her generation, she would spend hours ""scrolling and scrolling"" -- even when feeling unfulfilled. ""It was very easy to kind of find exactly what you like on there, because the [algorithm-run] For You page kept you there,"" she said. ""And it's entertaining, but you don't really get anything from it."" She described TikTok as often being a toxic environment that breeds narrow thinking, herd mentality, a misguided ""cancel culture"" and inappropriate online behavior such as critiquing the bodies of girls and women. Even people she knew in real life began acting differently after joining the app, which strained friendships, she said. Martin Poon, 15, also grew weary of TikTok, but it was hard to quit.  ""Everyone was using it, so I feel like there was a sense that you have to use it, you have to be on top of things, you have to know what's going on. And I think that was stressful to me,"" he said.  Misinformation and misogyny ran rampant on TikTok, with accounts like those of  Andrew Tate, the self-styled ""alpha male"" recently detained in Romania on allegations of human trafficking and rape, gaining popularity among boys at Poon's school.  ""It's just concerning how [these accounts] have so much impact on the youth, and it has so much grip on what we think and how it affects our behavior,"" said Poon -- though he added that misinformation is a major problem on all social media platforms, not just TikTok. Experts have long worried about the impact of TikTok on young people's mental health, with one study claiming the app may surface potentially harmful content related to suicide and eating disorders to teenagers within minutes of them creating an account. In response to growing pressure, TikTok recently announced a one-hour daily screentime limit for users under 18, though users will be able to turn off this default setting. Anderson acknowledged some positives about TikTok, like open conversations about mental health. Still, she was glad when the app became inaccessible. Falling asleep became easier without the lure of TikTok. ""I didn't have the self control to get off it on my own,"" she said. Exploring passions For Poon and his friend Ava Chan, also 15, TikTok's disappearance sparked new beginnings. When the app left in 2020, they were doing online classes, isolated from friends and bored at home. At the time, Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts had yet to arrive in Hong Kong. ""We had to figure out how to use our time other than being on TikTok,"" said Chan. ""For us, that was exploring our passions more."" For both, that came in advocating for the neurodiverse community. They launched a club at school that spreads education and awareness about neurodiversity, as well as participating in volunteer activities with neurodiverse people. Both said it lent them a sense of purpose, and as time went on, they saw other benefits. Their friends, who would previously spend time filming and watching TikToks together, began having more face-to-face conversations. They noticed peers begin exercising outdoors more, which was made easier as Covid restrictions lifted. Their mental health improved. Of course, being teenagers, they're not off social media entirely and use it as a tool to promote their club -- but it's far from the previous hours of scrolling. And while they occasionally wonder what's happening on TikTok outside Hong Kong, the allure of it is lost when nobody else around them uses it either. ""A lot of people, they've just kind of forgotten about it,"" said Anderson. ""People move to different platforms -- or just move on.""

                      OPEC's surprise production cut complicates the Fed's fight against inflation

                      A surprise production cut announcement this week from Saudi Arabia and several other OPEC+ oil producers complicates the Federal Reserve's mission to cool the economy and could worsen inflation in the United States, economists say.  Energy prices across the globe surged last year when Russia invaded Ukraine, fueling global inflation just as the world's major economies were beginning to rebalance after the pandemic. Since then, a drop in energy prices has helped cool US inflation, which has fallen from a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June to 6% in February, year over year, according to the Consumer Price Index.  Energy prices, which make up around 7.5% of the overall index, were up 5% in February from the same month a year ago, well below the 41.3% rise last June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Now, with oil prices surging once again, headline inflation could remain elevated for longer or even rise. And Americans are already paying more at the pump — the national per-gallon average stood at $3.55 on Thursday, according to AAA, up from $3.40 a month ago. Even core inflation could be affected While Fed officials consider multiple economic metrics in order to inform their decision making, one of their main points of focus is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. However, higher oil prices can eventually push up core prices if they remain elevated for long enough. ""The Fed sees OPEC decisions as mostly geopolitical, but they can impact production of goods and the transportation of other items, so those higher oil prices can bleed into that core component, which the Fed does tend to focus on a little bit more in terms of setting policy,"" Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN. Plastic resin, for example, is a derivative of crude oil used to create everyday items such as bottles, wires, and clothes. The cost of jet fuel closely influences airfare prices. Consumer spending plays a key role Higher energy costs soften overall demand by weighing on consumer sentiment and consumer spending, both of which were surprisingly robust at the beginning of the year but have recently started to cool.  Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan fell to its lowest point on record last June when gas prices reached $5 a gallon. It has since improved with the decline of gasoline prices. ""Energy prices are a very powerful factor in people's expectations of inflation, but right now, they're not having that hold on consumer psychology yet,"" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust Corporation. ""If the price of a gallon of regular gasoline goes above $4, then that's a different story,"" he said. But weaker consumer spending could be a mixed bag in terms of inflation, said John Leer, chief economist at data analytics firm Morning Consult. While it can reduce inflationary pressure for service-providing businesses, it can also increase the odds of the United States going into a recession. ""If consumers are allocating a greater share of their wallet to energy expenses, that's going to limit their ability to spend money elsewhere, so on a real basis, you would see demand contract that way,"" Leer said. Ultimately, the volatility of oil prices mean they are just too difficult to track, said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in an interview with Bloomberg. However, he acknowledged the eventual impact of higher prices. ""Some of that might feed into inflation and make our job a little bit more difficult,"" he said.

                      The State University System of Florida Board of Governors has banned the social media app TikTok, along with some other software, applications, and developers, from use on university-owned devices ""due to the continued and increasing landscape of cyber threats."" In a memo sent to state university system presidents on Wednesday, Chancellor Ray Rodrigues said, ""This regulation requires institutions to remove technologies published in the State University System (SUS) Prohibited Technologies List from any university-owned device and to block network traffic associated with these technologies."" The ban is effective immediately, the memo said. ""Data privacy, particularly concerning student data and faculty research, is a critical priority for the State University System of Florida,"" the Board of Governors said in a statement to CNN. WeChat, Tencent also barred ""Therefore, at a March 29 meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, the Board unanimously approved an emergency regulation prohibiting the use of TikTok and other foreign actors identified as an immediate national security risk, across our 12 public university campuses,"" according to the Board of Governors. In addition to TikTok, the prohibited technologies include Kaspersky, VKontakte, Tencent QQ, WeChat and any subsidiary or affiliate.  CNN reached out to them for comment.  TikTok spokesperson Hilary McQuaide said ""TikTok has taken unprecedented actions to address national security concerns by securing U.S. user data on U.S. soil. The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing."" McQuaide added ""TikTok is enjoyed by more than 150 million Americans including university and college students and teachers to engage in the classroom."" Utah also regulating use  Bans and regulations of TikTok in particular, and of social media sites in general, have been increasing in the US and Europe as concerns over privacy, national security and child safety mount. Late last month, the governor of Utah signed a bill which requires teens to get parental approval to use social media.  Earlier this week, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office, which regulates data, fined TikTok for a number of breaches of data protection law. Italy is investigating TikTok for ""dangerous content.""

                      A labor market cooldown: US economy added just 236,000 jobs in March

                      US employers added just 236,000 jobs in March, coming in below expectations and indicating that the labor market is cooling off amid the Federal Reserve's yearlong rate-hiking campaign to chill inflation. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.5%, according to the March jobs report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting a net gain of 239,000 jobs for the month and a jobless rate of 3.6%, according to Refinitiv. This is the first jobs report in 12 months that came in below expectations. While the US labor market has kept trucking along despite other areas of the economy slowing under the weight of interest rate hikes, it is showing some signs of cooling. ""The labor market in March came in like a lion with a banking crisis and more layoffs, and is going out like a lamb with a solid jobs report,"" said Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor's lead economist, in a statement. ""The labor market is still strong, but it's gliding slowly back down to Earth."" Over the past 12 months, the labor market has seen a net gain of more than 4.1 million jobs, averaging 345,417 jobs gained, per month, helping drop the unemployment rate to decades-low levels.  March's total is a notable reduction from February's upwardly revised 326,000 jobs gained and January's monster jobs number — originally 517,000 but subsequently revised down to 472,000. The 236,000 jobs added during March is the smallest monthly gain since a decline in December 2020. Excluding the losses seen during the first year of the pandemic, it's the smallest monthly jobs gain since December 2019.  However, the job market remains above pre-pandemic norms: Between 2010 and 2019, the economy added an average of 183,000 jobs a month. President Joe Biden called the March employment report a ""a good jobs report for hard-working Americans,"" in a statement released Friday morning.  Industries such as leisure and hospitality, health care and government continued to lead the way in job gains. Industries reporting monthly losses included retail trade, temporary help, manufacturing, construction and information services. ""Industries that were facing acute labor shortages, particularly hospitality, are really making gains in getting the workforces back that they needed to,"" Jim McCoy, senior vice president at ManpowerGroup, told CNN. ""We saw some moderation in a few other sectors like government, like health care and then pretty much stability across most of the rest of the sectors. You have a few drops — retail dropped 15,000 — but in the grand scheme of things, I wouldn't consider that an alarming drop at all; that's just a normal wobble within a course of a month."" Employment in leisure and hospitality still has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Through March, the industry was about 368,000 jobs, or nearly 2.2%, shy of February 2020 employment levels, an analysis of BLS data shows. More cooling ahead Labor market data released earlier in the week teed up a more moderate jobs report.  Job openings fell to 9.93 million (the first sub-10 million total in nearly 10 years); ADP's private-sector job gains came in at 145,000 for March, landing below expectations of 200,000; the Challenger Report showed job cuts on the rise with 89,703 layoffs announced in March, a 15% gain from February; and continuing jobless claims hit 1.823 million, a level not seen since December 2021. For many months, weekly jobless claims data continued to paint a picture of an incredibly tight labor market that showed little impact from the building waves of mass layoff announcements from firms in technology and beyond.  However, Thursday's release from the Department of Labor included a series of significant revisions and seasonal adjustments to better reflect the labor market dynamics since the pandemic. The newly revised data shows a ""clear upward trajectory"" in initial claims since the beginning of February, with the four-week moving average rising to 240,000 claims from 200,000, noted Dante DeAntonio, director of Moody's Analytics.  ""The new revised path of [jobless] claims more closely aligns with an increase of job cut announcements in recent months and also with the slowdown in payroll growth,"" he said in a note. ""[Unemployment insurance] claims data will continue to provide an early signal into whether the labor market is likely to cool further in the coming months."" Some leading indicators in the March jobs report moved in a direction that would show a further cooling coming: The average workweek inched down to 34.4 from 34.5 hours, indicating employers could be starting to cut hours; temporary employment fell; and construction lost jobs for the first time since January 2022. ""I wouldn't necessarily call it an alarm bell at the moment, but those are the sectors [and indicators] you're going to want to continue to watch very closely,"" ManpowerGroup's McCoy said, noting that one month does not make a trend and that there remains strength in household finances. Still, the labor market continues to show resilience, said Amy Glaser, senior vice president at Adecco, a human resources and staffing firm. ""In reality, it's more of a rebalancing from the white-hot market post-pandemic,"" she said. ""We've heard a lot about layoffs, but there were still so many unfilled jobs in the tech sector that what we're seeing is a lot of folks who have been displaced or lost their jobs in the last few months, are very quickly finding new opportunities."" As of March, the median duration of unemployment was 8.1 weeks, down from 8.3 weeks in February, BLS data shows. Labor force participation climbs and wages ease The Fed wants to see more slack in the labor market: As the economy recovers from the pandemic, the demand for workers has far exceeded the supply, contributing to higher wages and inflationary pressures. Contributing to the tightness has been a smaller-than-expected labor force and participation rates that were slow to match projections or meet pre-pandemic levels.  During the past two and half years, a lot of ink has been spilled on the question of why workers were ""missing,"" with recent research zeroing in on Covid-19 deaths, reduced immigration, aging population and long Covid as the primary culprits.  Workers are now filing back into the labor market. In February, the labor force participation rate for workers between the ages of 25 and 54 hit 83.2%, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. And last month, the overall labor force participation rate continued its upward march, increasing to 62.6% and matching a pandemic-era high. But that's still below the February 2020 rate of 63.3%. Even though labor force participation increased, the unemployment rate ticked down by 0.1 percentage points to 3.5%. That's largely attributable to the strength in employment, according to Eugenio Aleman, Raymond James' chief economist. Average hourly earnings grew 0.3% from the month before, a slight uptick from the 0.2% seen in February. On an annual basis, earnings increases moderated to 4.2% from 4.6% the month before. ""The labor market continues to remain resilient and is a pillar of strength,"" said Glassdoor's Zhao. ""The Fed is looking for balance from the labor market, and today's report is a step in the right direction."" This is the last BLS jobs report that will be released before the central bank's next policymaking meeting on May 2-3 (the April jobs report drops on May 5). As of Friday, markets are still largely expecting the Fed to raise rates by another quarter point, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. —CNN's Nikki Carvajal contributed to this report.

                      Snoop Dogg, his ape and a question of celebrity hype

                      The question of whether Snoop Dogg deeply and sincerely liked some cartoon apes has become key in a federal lawsuit between the crypto empire Yuga Labs and the trollish artist Ryder Ripps.   Yuga Labs v. Ripps is a fight over trademarks, but legal filings in the case are pulling back the curtain on the year of mania around the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of cartoon apes.  The Bored Apes became some of the most famous NFTs after a series of celebrities said they got one. Snoop — not a plaintiff or defendant in the case — was one of the most famous and vocal owners of an ape. But Ripps' team says Snoop's love of the apes was not genuine, but bought and paid for by Yuga Labs — and federal regulations require celebs to disclose paid endorsements. Court documents filed by Ripps' lawyers claim Snoop was paid ""around $1 million"" to perform as a Bored Ape at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2022. The rapper did not disclose the payment in conjunction with his performance. Representatives for MTV did not respond to CNN's questions about Snoop's compensation for the appearance.  Celebrity-paid promos were part of the success of the broader crypto industry too, as revealed in the fallout from the collapse of FTX in November. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged eight celebrities for not disclosing they were paid to promote cryptocurrencies. Further, Snoop — along with several other celebrities and crypto firms — is facing a class action lawsuit filed in December that alleges he was part of a scheme to artificially inflate the price of Bored Apes with inauthentic celebrity hype.   The rapper's representatives did not respond to requests for comment on this story.  He told CNBC in an interview published in June last year that his interest in crypto focused on the intellectual property rights (IP) that came with it. ""Being able to own and control the whole IP and not be used as a face or marketing tool or, you know, someone as an ambassador, but to actually be the owner, the CEO,"" he replied when asked why he got into crypto.   The Bored Ape craze Bored Apes were already a craze — with many sports and entertainment stars using them for social media profile pics and more — when Ripps copied them last year. He sold his versions as RR/BAYC with an accompanying website that detailed claims the Bored Apes contained references to racist memes on 4chan, a troll website.  Yuga Labs sued Ripps not for defamation, but for trademark infringement.  Yuga didn't have registered trademarks, so it had to argue in court that consumers associate the company with its logos and apes. It did that, in part, by pointing to the many celebrities who publicly talked about Bored Apes.   Ripps' lawyers counter that the celebrities were paid to promote the apes without disclosing it, and therefore Yuga has ""unclean hands"" — a legal principle meaning that if the apes got their fame improperly, it can't be used to assert trademark rights.  Court documents recently filed by Ripps' lawyers state, ""Snoop Dogg created a music video featuring a BAYC image and performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in a performance using a BAYC image."" The filing further alleges: ""Yuga did not disclose its cash payment to Snoop Dogg for the endorsements, nor did it disclose that Snoop Dogg was a Yuga investor"" in connection with the performance. Yuga Labs previously told CNN that the celebrities were not paid to promote the Bored Apes.  Guy Oseary, a Hollywood agent who sits on Yuga's board and invested in the company, also told CNN the celebrities were not paid. But the Ripps filings say Oseary stated in a deposition ""he believes Snoop Dogg was paid around $1 million for 'financial support to do the video and performance...'""  Oseary did not respond to a request for comment on this subject. Oseary's deposition in the Ripps case has been sealed, at the request of Yuga Labs. A few hours after the filings were posted, Ripps' lawyers said they'd made an error in failing to redact the documents. A lawyer for Ripps told CNN he could not comment on the issue.   Yuga Labs initially declined to comment to CNN. After publication, a spokesperson sent the following statement: ""Defendants Ripps and [Jeremy] Cahen included verifiably false information in their court documents based on a twisted interpretation of the facts. Yuga Labs is proud of the investors and partners who share our vision for web3. The fact is that Yuga has never paid anyone to join or promote the club, and despite all the false allegations, Yuga has never given Apes to celebrities. When our seed round took place, we publicly and proudly announced our investors — including Snoop Dogg. Our involvement in his and Eminem's performance at the MTV VMA was well known and publicized before, during and after the show."" In a court filing posted Monday, Yuga said the description of Oseary's statements was ""incomplete and misleading,"" though it did not offer contradictory statements from his deposition. Yuga also said the Snoop information poses a danger of ""unfair prejudice and confusing the issues.""  John Jasnoch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the separate class action lawsuit, has been watching the Ripps case closely. ""The recent filings in the Ripps case provide a unique insight into the web of interconnected financial interests between the entertainment industry and predatory crypto venture capital,"" Jasnoch said.  Jasnoch pointed out that the sum Snoop allegedly received — around $1 million — is much more than the money paid to other celebrities who got busted for undisclosed crypto promo. Kim Kardashian was paid $250,000 to promote EthereumMax; the SEC fined her $1.26 million for not disclosing it last October. Lindsay Lohan was allegedly paid $10,000 to tweet about Tronix crypto tokens; the SEC charged her with illegally touting it without disclosure in March and ordered her to pay more than $40,000. Former NBA player Paul Pierce was paid $244,000 to promote EthereumMax; in February he agreed to pay $1.4 million for not disclosing it.  Failure to disclose In the press release about the Pierce fine, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, ""This case is yet another reminder to celebrities: The law requires you to disclose to the public from whom and how much you are getting paid to promote investment in securities, and you can't lie to investors when you tout a security.""  There is no indication that Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, is the target of any investigation or facing any federal accusation of wrongdoing. When CNN asked if Snoop Dogg was being investigated, the SEC issued its usual response that it would not comment on any specific case. The FTC also would not comment on a specific case. In general, an FTC spokesperson said, ""if there's a connection between an endorser and a marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed.""  The government views shilling for makeup or shoes as different from shilling for crypto. The SEC says cryptocurrency is a security -— an investment product that requires more extensive disclosures from an endorser. The SEC has not yet said whether NFTs — unique digital files bought and sold in crypto — are securities. Ripps' team says they are, and at least one federal court has recently agreed that NFTs can be securities, depending on how they're traded. Yuga says they're not.   Whether NFT issuers must make SEC-required disclosures can also have serious implications for regular people trying to make a quick buck on the internet. Molly White, a Harvard fellow and a critic of the crypto industry, told CNN some firms operated under a ""greater fools"" strategy — that to profit from their crypto products, they needed to bring in a wider and wider audience to offload them onto. Iconic celebrities brought in the widest audience possible.  Snoop's potential liability In their live/video hybrid performance at the VMAs, Snoop and Eminem morph into their Bored Apes as they rap about smoking weed and being rich. Snoop did not say he was paid, though Yuga asserted in court documents that Yuga's name appeared in the end credits of the awards show broadcast.  When looking at whether Snoop could be in regulatory trouble, there are a few questions to keep in mind, according to Charles Whitehead, a professor of business law at Cornell Law School. ""If Snoop is getting paid to promote the NFTs, then the first thing you'd have to decide is as a securities law matter, is it a security? If the answer is yes — and the SEC position has been in most of these cases, yes — then the question is, is he somehow conditioning interest in investing in securities?""   If Snoop were paid to say he'd invested in Bored Apes and they're really cool, ""That looks like it crosses the line at both the federal and the state level. ... He's got to disclose that this is a paid sponsorship and the amount that he's getting paid,"" Whitehead said.   Only dancing around as a Bored Ape, and not talking about it, ""looks a lot less like an endorsement, and looks a lot less like you are promoting an investment in the security,"" Whitehead said. That would be unlikely to raise SEC or FTC issues, he said. You are allowed to get paid to perform in a logo. You could ride around MTV's stage in a little wooden wagon for Wells Fargo.   But, there's another complicating layer. What if you've promoted an investment on social media — as Snoop did throughout 2022 — but you only get paid to dance around in the investment's logo in a video? ""Paid for the video but not paid for the tweets? Well, I mean, nudge nudge wink wink,"" Whitehead said. ""If the substance is that I'm in fact getting paid to tout the security, even if the contract says I'm only getting paid for the video — too bad, so sad. You cannot get around the law that easily.""  The overlapping lawsuits provide a window into the overlapping interests of the people involved. When Snoop got his Bored Ape in December 2021, he tweeted the image and thanked MoonPay, a crypto payments firm that says its ""concierge service"" allows wealthy people to buy NFTs without setting up a crypto wallet. In March 2022, Snoop invested in Yuga Labs, and the month after, he invested in MoonPay. Court documents filed by Ripps' lawyers say Snoop also invested in Yuga as ""an indirect investor through the investment fund Sound Ventures,"" which is run by Guy Oseary, the Hollywood agent on Yuga's board. Sound Ventures invested in Yuga and MoonPay. MoonPay also invested in Yuga. One of MoonPay's crypto wallets spent $15 million on Bored Apes.  In the VMAs video, Eminem turns into a white ape wearing ""hip hop clothes,"" while Snoop becomes a cheetah-fur ape wearing a ""pimp coat,"" according to Yuga Labs' description. Eminem rapped, ""I was penniless, now I'm plenty rich. And the sh*t don't make any sens

                      The latest monthly jobs report showed that US hiring slowed in March but remained robust, with gains in service-providing businesses like bars and restaurants, but weakness in construction and manufacturing. Leisure and hospitality fueled last month's growth in payrolls, a trend that has held firm since the economy started its recovery from the pandemic. Government employers and the professional and business services industry also hired at a solid clip last month. But employment shrank in construction, manufacturing, and nondurable goods. Here's a look at where employment grew last month and where it shrank, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' report. Strongest gains Leisure and hospitality employers added 72,000 jobs last month, the most of any industry. But the sector is still 2.2% below pre-pandemic staffing levels and added a smaller-than-average number of jobs in March than in the six prior months. ""The gains we continue to see in health care and leisure and hospitality are because those industries are still trying to recoup earlier losses,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. ""So, the services sector held up but showed some signs of cooling."" Government employers added 47,000 jobs in March, led by hiring from state and local governments, which typically struggle to add workers in a tight labor market. Health care businesses added 34,000 jobs and employment in the business services sector — which includes many white-collar jobs such as accountants, engineers, and consultants — grew by 39,000. Government jobs also remain 314,000, or almost 1.4%, below their pre-pandemic level. Some weakness Cracks are beginning to form in the goods-production part of the labor market, however. The construction industry lost 9,000 jobs in March, the first decline in construction employment in more than a year and the largest job loss in the sector since May 2021 -— though still a drop of just under 1.1%. Demand for housing tanked at the end of last year when aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve pushed up borrowing costs for home buyers. But while new residential construction has slowed over the past year, construction jobs have held up, mostly because of a backlog in construction projects, Swonk said. She added that the March decline in construction employment is attributed to weak demand for housing and ""unusually harsh spring weather."" One other casualty of the Fed's rate hikes is manufacturing, which also lost jobs last month, according to the BLS. ""Manufacturing is one of the most interest-rate sensitive industries, as much as technology and financial services, so it's not surprising to see the job losses there,"" said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter. Data from the Institute for Supply Management released this week showed that the manufacturing sector contracted in March for the fifth month in a row. The survey's index fell to its lowest level since May 2020. The nondurable goods industry also saw a pullback in hiring, which was likely due to weaker consumer demand for clothes and household products, Buber added. ""Those goods are a bit more responsive to any changes in the market, and that's why we're seeing that industry respond faster than durable goods,"" Buber said. Temporary jobs also declined by nearly 11,000 in March, which could be an indicator that the labor market is going to soften further in the coming months, according to Beth Ann Bovino, US chief economist at S&P Global. ""If you start to see a reduction in temporary hires, that usually means that businesses are seeing some softness in the revenue stream, which is one of the first signs of an easing in the jobs market,"" Bovino said.

                      A third juvenile suspect sought in connection with the recent shooting deaths of three teenagers in Central Florida has been arrested, according to police.  The US Marshals Service ""captured Tahj Brewton"" on Saturday with assistance from the Lake County Sheriff's Office, according to a Facebook post from the Marion County Sheriff's Office.  The sheriff's office had offered up to $10,000 for information leading to the capture of Brewton, who had remained at large and was considered ""armed and dangerous.""    The sheriff's office said that Brewton, 16, ""was arrested on oustanding warrants for carjacking with a firearm, aggravated assault, grand theft of a motor vehicle, fleeing or attempt to elude a law enforcement officer, and tampering with an electronic monitoring device."" He was arrested just south of Groveland, Florida. The Marion County Sheriff's Office said the investigation into the recent shooting deaths of the three teenagers is ongoing and ""additional charges are forthcoming.""   Two other suspects, Robert Le'Andrew Robinson, 17, and Christopher De'l Atkins, 12, have been arrested and charged with first-degree murder, police said Friday.  The three juvenile suspects were sought in connection with the killing of three teenagers at the end of March.  CNN is working to get comment from the suspects. It is not clear if the suspects will be tried in the juvenile or adult system. Police identified one of the victims as 16-year-old Layla Silvernail, who was found shot on the side of the road in the Forest Lakes Park area on March 30 and died of her injuries. A 17-year-old male was found on the side of the road the next morning, and a third female victim was found in the trunk of Silvernail's car, which was partially submerged in a lake. Police have not named the other two victims. Police have said they believe the victims and the suspects were allegedly affiliated with criminal gangs.

                      Predictions about the decline of Christianity in America may be premature

                      The cross, and the empty tomb. Both Christian symbols are bookends to the Easter story. One symbolizes the tragic execution of Jesus while the other represents the Christian belief in his resurrection, and the claim that death does not have the final word on him or his followers.  As millions of Americans celebrate the holiest day in the Christian calendar on Sunday, most will hear some variation of this Easter message — finding new life in unforeseen places. But that message could also describe a surprising prediction about the future of Christianity in the US. For years, church leaders and commentators have warned that Christianity is dying in America. They say the American church is poised to follow the path of churches in Western Europe: soaring Gothic cathedrals with empty pews, shuttered church buildings converted into skate parts and nightclubs, and a secularized society where one theologian said Christianity as a norm is ""probably gone for good — or at least for the next 100 years."" Yet when CNN asked some of the nation's top religion scholars and historians recently about the future of Christianity in the US, they had a different message.  They said the American church is poised to find new life for one major reason: Waves of Christians are migrating to the US.  And they said the biggest challenge to Christianity's future in America is not declining numbers, but the church's ability to adapt to this migration. Joseph P. Slaughter, a historian and assistant professor of religion at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, says people have been predicting the extinction of Christianity in the US for over two centuries, and it hasn't happened yet. He pointed to Thomas Jefferson, one of the nation's founding fathers, who predicted in the 1820s that Christianity would be replaced in the US by a more enlightened form of religion that rejected Jesus' divinity and belief in miracles. Instead, Jefferson's prophecy was followed by a series of revivals, including the Second Great Awakening, which swept across America and reasserted Christianity as a dominant force in American life. ""I'd never bet against American Christianity — particularly evangelicalism,"" Slaughter says, ""and its ability to adapt and remain a significant shaper of the American society.""  What's happening in Europe is the church's nightmare scenario If one only looks at the numbers, Slaughter's optimism seems misguided. Virtually every recent poll about Christianity in America has been brutal for its followers.  About 64% of Americans call themselves Christian today. That might sound like a lot, but 50 years ago that number was 90%, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study. That same survey said the Christian majority in the US may disappear by 2070. The Covid-19 pandemic also hurt the church in America. Church attendance has rebounded recently but remains slightly below pre-pandemic levels.  A  2021 Gallup poll revealed another grim number for Christians: church membership in the US has fallen below 50% for the first time.  In addition, a cascade of headlines in recent years have stained the church's reputation, including sex abuse scandals in the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention; the spread of White Christian nationalism; and the perception that the church oppresses marginalized groups such as LGBTQ people. Church leaders in the US also have fretted about the rise of ""nones."" These are people who describe themselves as atheists, agnostics or ""nothing in particular"" when asked their religious identity. The ascent of nones will transform the country's religious and political landscape, says Tina Wray, a professor of religious and theological studies at Salve Regina University in Rhode Island. About 30% of Americans now call themselves nones. ""The interest of the nones will soon outweigh those of the religious right in just a matter of years,"" Wray says. ""Nones are going to vote as a bloc and they're going to be pretty powerful. White evangelicals will eventually be eclipsed by the unaffiliated.""  Wray says those who are optimistic about the future of the American church underestimate how quickly Christianity can lose its influence even in a place where it once thrived. She cites what's happened in the Republic of Ireland, an overwhelmingly Catholic country. The Catholic Church prohibits divorce and was once so powerful in Ireland that the country wouldn't legally grant its citizens the legal right to a divorce until 1995, says Wray, author of ""What the Bible Really Tells Us: The Essential Guide to Biblical Literacy."" But Wray adds that she recently traveled to Ireland and discovered many of its citizens have left the religion. Churches are being closed and turned into apartment buildings, she says. ""People who went to mass everyday stopped going,"" she says. ""There's this cultural Catholic identity, but as far as practicing their faith, it's just disappearing. So within a generation, that's all it took. It's just shocking."" Why the American church's future may be different than Europe's Most of the religious scholars CNN spoke to said the American church may find salvation in another demographic trend: the booming of Christianity in what is called the ""Global South,"" the regions encompassing Latin America, Africa and Asia. The world's largest megachurch, for example, is not in the US. It's in South Korea. The Yoido Full Gospel Church has a weekly attendance of about 600,000 members.  Perry Hamalis spent time as a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, where he personally witnessed the vitality of the Christian church in the Global South. He says the church is not perceived in South Korea as an instrument of oppression, but one of liberation. When South Korea was colonized by the Japanese in the early 20th century, the church aligned with Koreans to protest. ""Christianity was looked at not as a religion of empire and of the colonizers, but as the religion of the anti-colonial movement and of pro-democracy,"" says Hamalis, a religion professor at North Central College in Illinois. The US has more immigrants than any other country. People from Latin America and Asia now make up the overwhelming majority of immigrants to the US, and many are bringing their religious fervor with them. This migration is known as the ""Browning of America,"" a phrase describing a demographic shift that is expected to make White people the minority in the US by 2045.  Those who predict that the church in America will collapse often overlook how the migration of Global South Christians to America will revitalize the country's religious landscape, scholars say. Christianity could rebound in America if White Christians embrace this one change, they say. Tish Harrison Warren, a New York Times columnist, pointed out recently that Latino evangelicals are now the fastest-growing group of evangelicals in the US. ""We cannot assume that America will become more secular so long as the future of America is less white,"" Warren wrote. The influx of Black and brown Christians from places like Latin America and Asia collides with another trend: a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement that insists, incorrectly, that the US was founded as a White, Christian nation. It is hostile to non-White immigrants. Some churches may discover that Jesus' command to welcome the stranger collides with their definition of patriotism, Hamalis says. ""Many congregations don't realize how much of their Christian identity is wrapped up with a kind of (Christian) nationalist narrative,"" Hamalis says. ""There's nothing wrong with loving one's country, but from a Christian perspective that ought to always be secondary to the mission of building the body of Christ and witnessing to the Gospel in the world."" How Christianity could re-establish its dominance There are other factors hiding in plain sight that point to the continued vitality of Christianity, others say. For one, declining church membership doesn't automatically translate into declining influence. Consider some recent landmark events. White evangelicals played a critical role in getting former President Trump elected. Conservative Christian groups played a crucial role in the recent passage of state laws limiting LGBTQ rights. And the Supreme Court's decision last year to overturn Roe vs. Wade was a massive victory for many conservative Christians. And atheism remains a taboo in American politics. American voters still prefer candidates -- including presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden -- who profess or evoke Christian beliefs. ""Christianity still holds a lot of capital in this country,"" says Lee M. Jefferson, an associate professor of religion at Centre College in Kentucky. ""There has always been a popular notion that a religious community's strength or influence is connected to numbers and attendance,"" Jefferson says. ""Even if there is ample space in cathedrals, Christianity will still hold some strong relevance in different landscapes in the US."" Even the rise of the ""nones,"" the growing number of Americans who say they don't care about religion, is not as much of a threat to the church as initial reports suggest, scholars say. A growing number of Americans may no longer identify as Christian, but many still care about spirituality, says Hans Gustafson, author of ""Everyday Wisdom: Interreligious Studies for a Pluralistic World.""  ""Just because more Americans are disaffiliating with institutionalized religion — most notably Christian traditions — this does not always mean that people are becoming less religious,"" says Gustafson, director of the Jay Phillips Center for Interreligious Studies at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. ""Many still practice spirituality: prayer, meditation... and sometimes even regularly attend religious houses of worship,"" he says. Among Americans with no religious affiliation, some still pray daily and say religion is very important in their lives, Gustafson says. He cites a surprising finding from a 2018 Pew Research Center study of religion in Western Europe. The study found that nones in the US are ""much more likely"" to pray and believe in God than their European counterparts, said Neha Sahgal, a vice president of research at Pew. ""In fact, by some of these standard measures of religious commitment, American 'nones' are as religious as — or even more religious than — Christians in several European countries, including France, Germany and the UK,"" Sahgal wrote. Why the Easter message offers a note of hope  Despite the optimism of many religious scholars, the future of Christianity in America still seems uncertain. Poll numbers about the decline of religiousness in the US cannot be ignored, along with something more intangible: the frailties of human nature. What if the US enters another xenophobic period and limits migration from non-White Christians?  What if progressive Ch

                      US Customs and Border Protection officers in Philadelphia have seized counterfeit auto parts worth nearly $200,000, the agency said. The parts were shipped from China to Philadelphia in March, including air bag covers, aluminum hoods, front fenders and bumpers, and badges featuring the logos of Chevrolet, Buick and Dodge, the CBP said in a news release. If the parts were authentic, the manufacturer's suggested retail price would be $196,035. Officers intercepted the shipment on March 2. Suspecting they were counterfeit, they submitted photos and documentation to trade experts at the Centers of Excellence and Expertise and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. CBP received word on March 31 the auto parts were counterfeit. CBP officers promptly seized the shipment and launched an investigation. Thus far, no one has been criminally charged. ""Consumers in need of auto repairs should be wary of unscrupulous repair shops and greedy internet vendors that prioritize profits over the safety of their customers,"" said Joseph Martella, CBP's Area Port Director for the Area Port of Philadelphia. ""Consumer safety is a top priority to Customs and Border Protection and CBP officers will continue to seize counterfeit goods that threaten the health and safety of American consumers."" CBP officers and Homeland Security Investigations special agents seized nearly 21,000 shipments containing counterfeit products in fiscal year 2022. The estimated value of the seized products was more than $2.98 billion, the statement said.

If you're a first-time filer — or know someone who is — check out these helpful tips to make taxes less taxing. Here's what else you need to know to Start Your Week Smart. The weekend that was • China said it was simulating precision attacks on key targets in Taiwan as the military drills launched in response to the island president's meeting with the US House speaker entered a second day. The drills included ""tactical maneuvers"" by the Chinese navy, state media said. • A pair of conflicting federal court rulings created arguably the most contentious and chaotic legal flashpoint over abortion access since the Supreme Court's ruling last summer that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the right to an abortion nationwide. Both cases deal with how the US Food and Drug Administration regulates mifepristone.  • Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said that he did not disclose luxury travel paid for by a Republican donor because he was advised at the time that he did not have to report it. The travel with his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, included lavish trips on donor Harlan Crow's yacht and private jet and was the subject of a bombshell ProPublica report.  • The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into the leaks of a trove of apparent US intelligence documents that were posted on social media in recent weeks. The investigation comes as new documents surfaced covering everything from US support for Ukraine to information about key US allies like Israel. • Residents in the German city of Hamburg have been warned of heavy smoke and possible toxins in the air after a major fire broke out at a warehouse. Video circulating on social media shows the warehouse engulfed in flames, with smoke billowing into the sky. The week ahead Monday Thousands of visitors are expected to converge on the South Lawn of the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll, a tradition that dates back to the 1870s. The theme of the event, the first lady's office says, is ""EGGucation"" for a second year in a row. Look for a new and improved Easter Bunny to make its debut. April 10 also is National Siblings Day, so expect your Instagram feed to be flooded with some heartwarming and/or awkward photos.  Tuesday President Joe Biden will travel to Belfast in Northern Ireland to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which the US helped broker to bring an end to decades of sectarian violence. The last US president to visit Belfast was Barack Obama in 2013. Later in the week, Biden will visit Ireland, where ""he will discuss our close cooperation on the full range of shared global challenges,"" the White House said. Wednesday The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release the Consumer Price Index for March — a key gauge of inflation. February's reading came in at 6%, down from January's 6.4% and the eighth straight monthly decline. Thursday Jury selection begins in Dominion Voting Systems' historic defamation case against Fox News. Both sides had asked a Delaware judge for a pretrial ruling in their favor, but after thousands of pages of filings and exhibits and a series of courtroom clashes, he decided the case should go to trial. The decision was a painful setback for Fox News and sets the stage for a lengthy trial where the network's top executives and most prominent hosts could be called to testify about the 2020 election lies that were promoted on its air. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages.

More than 99% of Service Employees International Union Local 99 members voted to approve the new agreement in voting held between April 3 and 7, per the union, which represents about 30,000 Los Angeles school custodians, cafeteria workers, bus drivers and other student services staff.  The board of the Los Angeles Unified School District also has to vote on the agreement, which the union said includes: • A 30% wage increase, bringing the average salary from $25,000 to $33,000  • A $1,000 bonus for those who worked during the Covid-19 pandemic  • Fully paid family health care benefits that will be expanded to teachers' assistants and after-school program workers, among others • Increased hours for workers like special education assistants ""This contract recognizes the essential work of those who work hard to ensure students can learn in a clean, safe, and supportive environment,"" Max Arias, SEIU Local 99 executive director, said in the release.  ""It is a major step forward with significant improvements to wages, work hours, and benefits for dedicated education workers who have been left behind for far too long."" Feeling undervalued by what the union said were low wages, minimal staffing and inadequate hours, members went on strike for three days last month, between March 21 and 23, halting classes for the more than half a million students served by the nation's second-largest school district.

                      All Boston residents are now eligible for tuition-free schooling at six community colleges -- regardless of their age, income or immigration status -- under a new plan announced by the city government. City officials announced the expansion of its ""Tuition-Free Community College Plan"" in a Wednesday news release.  The program provides funding for up to three years of tuition and fees at six partner institutions, according to the news release. The funding also covers up to $250 per semester in related costs, like textbooks and transportation, and debt up to $2,500 for ""students with an outstanding balance at a partner college that is preventing a student from re-enrolling at that college."" Bostonians will be eligible for free tuition at Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology, Bunker Hill Community College, Massasoit Community College, MassBay Community College, Roxbury Community College and Urban College of Boston, according to the release. Potential students won't need to fill out a separate application for the program, just the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, according to the release. Undocumented immigrants and students who have DACA status or Temporary Protected Status will not need to complete the FAFSA to be eligible for the program. Any associate's degree or ""short-term certificate program"" at a partner institution will be eligible for the funding, according to a fact sheet published by the Boston government. Students who are already enrolled at a participating school are not eligible for the plan. ""Costs should not be a barrier to higher education,"" said Boston Mayor Michelle Wu in a tweet Wednesday. The program ""will continue to help more residents afford, attend & complete college."" Massachusetts congresswoman Ayanna Pressley also voiced excitement for the expansion on Twitter. ""Expanding Boston's free community college program will help remove economic barriers to higher education,"" she said.

                      How electric tuk-tuks could become a 'virtual power plant' for this country

                      The streets of Dhaka are filled with constant clamor. Among the chorus of honking horns and ringing bells, roaring cars and rattling rickshaws, you can hear the electric hum of the city's three-wheeled open taxis, called tuk-tuks, as they weave through traffic. Among the chaos, one Bangladeshi startup has spotted an opportunity. SOLshare plans to tap into the country's estimated 2.5 million electric tuk-tuks, and turn them into a ""virtual power plant."" ""When (the tuk-tuks) return to the garage at the end of the night, they come back with 30% juice in their batteries,"" says Salma Islam, head of projects, fundraising and communication at SOLshare. ""If they can feed that back into the grid when the demand is really high, that would be amazing.""  SOLshare knows exactly how much electricity is left in these tuk-tuks because it has been working with local garages to upgrade their conventional lead-acid batteries to smart, lithium-ion batteries. These are equipped with SOLshare's digital chip, which collects data on the battery's performance, location, and charge level.  The startup claims that the leftover electricity in these batteries could provide up to 20% of the nation's energy when demand is at its highest. The vehicles would recharge overnight when demand on the grid is lowest.  SOLshare hopes that this mobile power supply could help to stabilize Bangladesh's energy grid — and power the country's economic development.  ""The demand is constantly growing, because the population is also growing, and as people's livelihoods get better, their energy requirements also increase,"" says Islam.  A bright idea SOLshare launched its EV pilot program, called SOLmobility, in 2021. It partnered with 15 tuk-tuk garages to upgrade the batteries of around 40 vehicles and began gathering data on the mileage and activities of the three-wheelers.  The smart batteries use 40% less energy than lead-acid batteries, says Islam. Additionally, the lithium-ion batteries charge in just six hours, around half the time of lead-acid batteries, and are lighter and more efficient. Although they're more expensive, costing more than double compared to lead acid batteries, they last up to five times longer, says Islam.  Muhammad Delwar Hossain, who has been driving a tuk-tuk in the Dhaka suburb of Tongi for over a decade, started using a SOLshare smart battery last year. He says it's boosted his monthly earnings by 50% because he can make more trips on a single charge, and he feels his health has improved because he's no longer breathing in the toxic fumes emitted by the lead-acid battery.  A light in the dark SOLshare's ambitions go far beyond tuk-tuks -- it wants to transform Bangladesh's entire energy sector through multiple strands.  In 2015, the company began building peer-to-peer solar-powered microgrids that allow households without solar panels to buy excess energy from others in the community using a pay-as-you-go mobile top-up system. To date, it has installed 118 microgrids across the country. The startup has raised $6 million so far.     The company also installs solar panel systems for homes and commercial buildings, and has 27 megawatts of installation in the pipeline, says Islam.  Increasing solar power can help the country reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, says Islam -- and these microgrids could even feed excess energy back into the national grid. SOLshare's innovations come at a pivotal time for the nation's energy sector.  ""We had massive power grid failures last summer ... that was an eye opener for everyone,"" says Islam.  Across the country, households experienced frequent load-shedding, a practice of enforced power outages that reduces strain on the grid to prevent a total blackout. Then, in October 2022, Bangladesh suffered its biggest blackout in eight years when the national grid failed and plunged 96 million people into darkness. Despite being home to the world's largest off-grid solar power program, Bangladesh's rapid growth and increasing demand for electricity means renewables account for just 3.5% of its energy.  The low-lying nation is also one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries in the world and is highly susceptible to floods, droughts and storms -- so finding a sustainable way to support its growing energy demand is vital.   ""I think they were a little bit early, ahead of their time,"" says Sonia Bashir Kabir, founder of Bangladesh venture capital firm SBK Tech Ventures and an early investor in SOLshare. She believes the next five years hold a lot of opportunity for the company. ""The government has taken a very serious mandate to look at climate, which helps because that means the policies are going to be favorable,"" she says.   Accelerating the renewable revolution  Bangladesh isn't the only country struggling to meet energy demand: disruptions in the oil and gas supply throughout 2022 have caused a global energy crisis. This has fueled a renewable revolution, with solar and wind energy growing 30% faster than expected last year -- and many are hoping it will accelerate the expansion of the green energy sector. SOLshare is continuing to upgrade more tuk-tuks, as well as working with battery manufacturers to install its digital chip directly into the battery.  Through its different projects, Islam hopes the company will become ""Asia's largest virtual utility provider"" -- a model that could play ""a massive role"" in other countries with large fleets of electric three-wheel vehicles, such as Thailand and India, she says.  ""We are tapping into as many decentralized renewable sources as possible, and not relying on just a central power grid,"" says Islam. ""The way we see it, if we can do this right here in Bangladesh, you can actually do it anywhere.""

Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who is being held in Russia, has been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department.   “Today, Secretary Blinken made a determination that Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained by Russia,” State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement Monday. The designation underscores the United States government’s statements that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless, and it will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.  Gershkovich’s case will now be handled at the State Department through the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.   Both of the Americans who have been recently brought home from Russia — Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner — had been designated as wrongfully detained, and were freed in prisoner swaps.  Paul Whelan, who remains imprisoned in Russia, also has been declared wrongfully detained.  In his statement, Patel said the “U.S. government will provide all appropriate support to Mr. Gershkovich and his family.” “We call for the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr. Gershkovich,” he said. “We also call on Russia to release wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.” Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv Monday. Branson became a new ambassador for UNITED24, Ukraine's official fundraising platform. Zelensky thanked Branson for his support of the country during the war, saying ""it is very important that famous and influential personalities keep joining this platform. One of our key tasks is to keep the world's focus on Russia's war against Ukraine, which has been going on for over a year."" Branson told Zelensky that on the way to Kyiv, he stopped in Lviv and met some soldiers, including one ""who lost both arms and a leg and he was still smiling and positive and wanted to get back to the frontline."" Earlier Branson was in Bucha, outside Kyiv, with American philanthropist Howard Buffett, supporting the building of a kitchen that will help feed children in educational facilities. The kitchen will help communities in Bucha, Nemishaevo and Borodianka. Branson attended an event for the kitchen with Bucha Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk, Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska, and Deputy Head of the Presidential Office Oleksiy Kuleba. ""More than 10,000 hot meals will be cooked here every day for our children. Another similar factory will be built in the Kharkiv region with Mr. Howard's support as well,"" Mayor Fedoruk said on Telegram Monday. This isn't the first time Branson went to Ukraine. He also met with Zelensky in June. US President Joe Biden is staying briefed on the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked in recent weeks, the White House said Monday.   “The president has been briefed, he was first briefed late last week when we all got word that there were some documents out there,” National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told reporters at a White House press briefing Monday afternoon. “He has stayed briefed and in contact with national security officials throughout the weekend.” Kirby said the Department of Defense had referred the case to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation and directed questions to them when asked if the government has any sense of who leaked the documents, “I'm not aware that they've come to any conclusions at this point about where they're coming from,” Kirby said.  Asked if the administration believed the leak is contained or if there’s an ongoing threat, Kirby responded: “We don't know. We truly don't.” CNN previously reported that the documents provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. In response to questions about whether Biden has contacted foreign allies in response, Kirby said US officials “have been in touch with relevant allies and partners over the last couple of days at very high levels.”  Kirby said “we know that some of them have been doctored,” but that he didn’t want to “speak to the validity of all the documents.”  “We're still working through the validity of all the documents that we know are out there,” Kirby said.  Pressed on if the US believes that some of the documents are valid, Kirby said the administration “cannot speak to the veracity and the validity of any of those documents at this point.”  Kirby added that there is, “no excuse for these kinds of documents to be in the public domain"" and he said the bigger concern was that the documents had become public at all.  ##Pentagon Docs##  US State Department Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has been tapped to lead the diplomatic response to the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, according to a US official familiar with the matter. US government officials “are engaging with allies and partners at high levels over this including to reassure them of our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and the fidelity of securing our partnerships” following the mass leak of highly classified documents, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Monday. Patel would not go into details about which countries they had engaged, saying “that work is ongoing.” Asked by CNN if the State Department is taking the lead on those conversation, Patel said that “as the main diplomatic branch and agency of this administration, of course the Department of State would have a role in communicating with our allies and partners, but these conversations are happening across the administration.” “US officials are engaging with allies and partners at the highest level over this,” he said.  Patel would not say if any steps had been taken to restrict access to classified information at the State Department as a result of the leak, saying he did not want to discuss policy decisions.  CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  International response: Patel would not speak on specific comments from South Korean and Israeli officials reacting to leaked documents. South Korea’s presidential office said it will hold “necessary discussions with the US” regarding the document leak, which comes as the relationship between Seoul and Washington is already strained due to South Korean anger over the Inflation Reduction Act harming South Korea’s electronic vehicle industry and concerns related to the US CHIPS Act.  “There is a lot of frustration towards the Yoon administration for being too committed to the US alliance so every aspect of the US-South Korea relationship is under the microscope,” said a former US Ambassador to South Korea.   The South Korean president is scheduled to visit the White House later this month, making the timing around this incident particularly unfortunate the former diplomat said.   “Does Yoon have to raise this during the State Visit? We don’t know yet,” the diplomat said More broadly, one diplomat from a NATO country told CNN that they do not believe Moscow was overly surprised by the most of the intel that was revealed in the leaked documents, noting Russia has robust intelligence gathering operations.  They also said that they were not frustrated that there was US intelligence that was not widely shared with allies. This diplomat said most nations do not share everything with their allies nor is there an expectation that they do so.  “That’s not the way it works,” the diplomat said. ##Pentagon Docs## Russian opposition politician, Vladimir Kara-Murza, told a Moscow court that he was “proud” of his political views during his final hearing on Monday. Kara-Murza was arrested in April 2022 after returning to Moscow to campaign against Russia’s war in Ukraine.  Russian prosecutors have requested a 25-year sentence in prison for criminal offenses that include treason, spreading fakes about the Russian army, and facilitating activities of an undesirable organization, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Kara-Murza delivered closing remarks before the court.  “I’m in jail for my political views; for speaking out against the war in Ukraine, for many years of struggle against Putin’s dictatorship, for facilitating the adoption of personal international sanctions under the Magnitsky Act against human rights violators. Not only do I not repent of any of this, I am proud of it,” Kara-Murza said  The opposition politician said he blamed himself for not being able to convince enough of his “compatriots” and politicians of democratic countries of the danger that the current regime in the Kremlin poses for Russia and the world.  Kara-Murza said he hoped “that the day will come when the darkness over our country will dissipate,” adding, “even today, even in the darkness surrounding us, even sitting in this cage, I love my country and believe in our people. I believe that we can walk this path.” Kara-Murza confirmed on Twitter that the verdict for his case would be announced on April 17.  Last month, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on a number of Russian individuals connected to the arbitrary detention of Kara-Murza.  The Pentagon is still working to determine the scale of a leak of classified information that has occurred in recent weeks, Chris Meagher, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said Monday.  CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  “The Department of Defense is working around the clock to look at the scope and scale of the distribution, the assessed impact, and our mitigation measures,” Meagher said. “We're still investigating how this happened, as well as the scope of the issue. There have been steps to take a closer look at how this type of information is distributed and to whom. We’re also still trying to assess what might be out there.”  Meagher said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was first briefed on the leak on April 6 and began “convening senior leaders on a daily basis” the next day.  Over the weekend, US officials engaged with allies and partners — some of whom were also implicated in the document leak, Meagher said.  The Pentagon team is also working to determine if the leak of classified material includes the Defense Department’s legislative affairs, public affairs, policy, general counsel, intelligence and security, and joint staff offices, Meagher said.  Meagher said the team is a “coordinated effort amongst several different components of DOD” who were all working to “get our arms around everything that has to do with” the leak. Meagher declined to say who specifically was in charge of that team and overseeing those efforts. ##Pentagon Docs## Valeria Karpylenko, a border guard from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine, is among the military personnel released during Monday's prisoner swap.  She is visible in videos released by the Ukrainian government showing prisoners of war returning home. Karpylenko fought alongside her husband in the besieged Azovstal steel plant. On May 5, 2022, she and her husband were married in an Azovstal bunker — but just three days later, he was killed, according to a Facebook post by Karpylenko at the time. She had promised that she would survive the siege and live for them both.  Some background: CNN reported earlier that Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners of war in their latest swap.  Ukraine's presidential office head, Andriy Yermak confirmed that 100 Ukrainians were returned home. They included ""military, sailors, border guards, and National Guard servicemen."" Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces said Monday evening that its main focus is repelling Russian forces in Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivak and Marinka in the east.  It said over twenty attacks were repelled in the last 24 hours in those areas. Russia launched 21 airstrikes and five missile strikes across Ukraine, including four in Kramatorsk from S-300 air defense systems. Russia is also increasing the number of checkpoints and patrols in several occupied areas, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Over the last day, Ukrainian Defense Forces say they shot down a Russian Mi-24 helicopter and six UAVs. Russia's Defense Ministry says that 106 Russian servicemen ""who had been held captive in mortal danger, were returned from Kyiv-controlled territory"" Monday. The servicemen will be flown to Moscow and provided with medical and psychological assistance. Ukraine's presidential office head, Andriy Yermak confirmed there was a prisoner swap saying 100 Ukrainians were returned home. They included ""military, sailors, border guards, and National Guard servicemen.""  He said that ""defenders of Mariupol, Azovstal and Hostomel"" who were ""seriously injured and have diseases"" are among those released, adding it's a key priority for President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""return all our people."" Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters on the Treatment of Prisoners of War provided more details on the Ukrainian servicemen who were returned. ""As a result of another exchange of prisoners of war, 80 male defenders and 20 female defenders are returning home. Nine of them are officers, the rest are privates and sergeants. This time, 24 National Guardsmen, 22 border guards, 22 representatives of the Navy, 21 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 11 territorial defense members were released, "" the group said on its Telegram channel Monday. ""Almost half of the released prisoners have serious injuries, illnesses or have been tortured. The youngest of the liberated defenders is 19 years old,"" it added. Separately from the prisoner of war exchange with Russia, ""in accordance with the Geneva Conventions,"" Ukraine also handed over five ""more severely wounded"" prisoners including ""the only woman who was held in Ukrainian captivity,"" according to Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Their repatriation took place without any conditions from the Russian side, according to the organization. Two more prisoners were also released who are Muslim. This was part of a proposal to exchange Muslims ""all for all"" on both sides as a sign of respect during the holy month of Ramadan. And earlier on March 24, Ukraine repatriated five seriously wounded Russians, according to Ukraine's Coordination Headquarters on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, posted a video of his visit to the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut on his Telegram channel Monday. The video shows Pushilin driving into the tattered city with mangled military vehicles on the sides of the road and buildings with windows blown out or reduced to rubble. Pushilin says he went to the city center where Russia's Wagner private military group ""installed our flags"" in the place where the administrative building was. He blamed Kyiv for the damage.  Kyiv has blamed the damage on Russia. Moscow's troops have switched to so-called ""scorched Earth"" tactics in the eastern city of Bakhmut, and are destroying buildings and positions with airstrikes and artillery fire, said Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian Land Forces, in a Monday statement posted on Telegram by the Ukrainian military.  Pushilin also met with a Russian official who maintains contact with voters in the DPR and he says they discussed organizing humanitarian aid points from Russia. In September, pro-Russian authorities held so-called referendums in four regions of Ukraine. The votes have been universally dismissed as “a sham” by Ukraine and Western nations. In the video, Pushilin said Wagner soldiers are evacuating people, and ""we are providing accommodations for them in the DPR."" He said they take 15 to 45 people out at once. Ukraine has described these types of evacuations as forced. Pushilin has claimed more than 75% of Bakhmut is now under the control of Russian forces, Russian state media TASS reported Monday, citing an interview on the state television channel Russia 24.  Though Pushilin reportedly said it was too early to talk about the complete liberation of the city, he said fierce battles were ongoing on its Western flank, according to TASS.  Pushilin also said the liberation of the nearby town of Marinka, which has been decimated by Russian shelling, had been delayed due to Ukraine constantly bringing in reserve troops. TASS reported he also claimed Russian forces were making serious advances in the Avdiivka area, which the Ukrainian military warned last month was at risk of becoming a “second Bakhmut.”  Twenty-four more children from the region have returned home on Monday, after being taken illegally to Russian territory, Kherson authorities said. ""Today I met them in Kherson to talk to them and present them with nice gifts,"" Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said in a Telegram post. ""This was one of the most difficult rescue missions. The Russians interrogated the children for 13 hours and later forced them to participate in a propaganda report,"" he said. CNN is unable to independently verify this claim. However, a February report from US State Department-backed Conflict Observatory by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab alleged Moscow's involvement in an expansive network of camps where kids underwent “political reeducation."" ""The main thing is that now the children are home with their families. Daring to live, daring to be happy again,"" Prokuduin said, adding ""we are grateful to the volunteers of the Charitable Foundation 'Save Ukraine,' who made incredible efforts to rescue the little Ukrainians from Russian captivity."" ""We will definitely bring home all Ukrainians illegally detained by Russia!"" he said, but did not share additional details about this latest ""rescue mission.""  More on family reunification efforts: This comes after a group of 31 Ukrainian children was reunited with their families over the weekend — months after they were taken from their homes and moved to Russian-occupied territories. Allegations of widespread forced deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia form the basis of the International Criminal Court's war crimes charges against Russian President Vladimir Putin and a senior Russian official, Maria Lvova-Belova. The Office of Ukraine's President recently estimated the total number of Ukrainian children forcibly removed from their homes is at least 20,000. Thousands of cases are already under investigation, Kyiv has said. Russian denies it is doing anything illegal and says it is bringing Ukrainian children to safety.  Russia has turned to airstrikes and artillery as it attempts to take the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut using ""scorched earth"" tactics, according to Ukraine's top land commander. Elsewhere, the fallout from the leak of classified US intelligence documents continues, with the Kremlin denying any involvement. Here are the latest headlines: Russia devastating Bakhmut: Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy Bakhmut in what Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Ukrainian Land Forces, has called ""scorched Earth"" tactics. ""Our brave soldiers have exhausted the Wagner fighters with their actions, so the enemy is now forced to engage special forces and air assault units in the battle for Bakhmut,"" Syrskyi said.
            Ukraine says Russia is using intel leak to spread disinformation: A Ukrainian Defense Ministry representative on intelligence accused Russia of using altered versions of the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online to spread disinformation. ""In recent decades, Russia's most successful intelligence operations have been carried out in Photoshop,"" said Andrii Yusov.
            Kremlin denies involvement in documents leak: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has dismissed accusations that Moscow may have been involved in the Pentagon leak of classified documents. “The tendency to always blame Russia for everything and blame everything on Russia is now a common disease,” he said. 
            Lukashenko asks Russia to defend Belarus: Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Minsk on Monday, telling Shoigu that he hopes Russia would protect Belarus ""as its own territory"" in case of aggression. ##Catch Up## Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has dismissed accusations that Moscow may have been involved in the Pentagon leak of classified documents. Asked during a regular call with journalists on Monday whether Russia or pro-Russian sources could be behind the leak, Peskov criticized what he said was a tendency to blame Moscow. “The tendency to always blame Russia for everything and blame everything on Russia is now a common disease,” he said.  Peskov also said the leaks are “quite interesting” and that he cannot rule out that the US could have been eavesdropping on its key allies. “The fact that the United States has long begun surveillance of various heads of state, especially of European capitals, has repeatedly surfaced and caused scandalous situations,” Peskov said. “Therefore, this cannot be ruled out.” The leaked Pentagon documents, which include highly classified information on US support for Ukraine and key US allies such as Israel, were posted online.  US officials have confirmed the authenticity of some of the leaked documents, which also allege the US was eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine. ##Pentagon Docs## A Ukrainian Defense Ministry representative on intelligence accused Russia of altering the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks.  ""In recent decades, Russia's most successful intelligence operations have been carried out in Photoshop,"" Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine, said in a national televised interview, according to remarks posted on the directorate's website on Saturday.  ""Based on a preliminary analysis of these documents, we see false figures for losses on both sides. Some of the information is clearly collected from open sources,"" Yusov said.  The ministry's intelligence representative said the needs of the Ukrainian army have been ""discussed at all levels"" and that it's ""no secret that Ukraine is asking for aircraft, tanks, ammunition and other things.""  The comments echo earlier claims by Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, who said on his Telegram channel Friday he believes the Russians are behind the purported leak.  Podolyak said the documents that were disseminated are inauthentic, have “nothing to do with Ukraine’s real plans” and are based on “a large amount of fictitious information.” As CNN reported earlier, bad actors are using the leaked documents to spread disinformation, analysts say. The document with casualty numbers, for example, was altered in recent weeks to more than halve the number of Russian deaths, before being spread on pro-Russian Telegram channels. Asked earlier about the images circulating on Twitter and Telegram, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN in a statement that “we don’t have the slightest doubt about direct or indirect involvement of the United States and NATO in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine."" What was in the classified documents: The highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online cover everything from US support for Ukraine to information about key US allies like Israel.  Some of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, expose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. Some of the documents divulge key weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces gear up to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians – and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. As CNN reported earlier, Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. ##Pentagon Docs## Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Minsk on Monday, according to Belarusian state news agency BelTa. The Russian defense minister arrived in the Belarusian capital to follow-up on recent agreements between Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to BelTa. Lukashenko told Shoigu that he hopes Russia would protect Belarus ""as its own territory"" in case of aggression, according to BelTa.  They also discussed combat training and cohesion of the two countries' joint forces, which includes Russian servicemen who are on the territory of Belarus, according to BelTA, which quoted Lukashenko saying there are currently ""several thousand"" Russian servicemen in Belarus.  Some context: Belarus is one of Russia’s few allies in its war on Ukraine. While the country’s military isn’t directly involved in the fighting, Belarus helped Russia launch its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country from its territory. CNN's Ivana Kottasová, Lindsay Isaac and Anna Chernova contributed to this post. Russia has switched to so-called ""scorched Earth"" tactics in the eastern city of Bakhmut and is destroying buildings and positions with airstrikes and artillery fire, according to Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander of the Ukrainian Land Forces. On Sunday, Syrskyi visited some of the hottest spots on the front line in the Bakhmut area and met with the brigades who are defending Ukrainian positions near the embattled city, according to a statement posted on Telegram by the Ukrainian military on Monday. ""Our brave soldiers have exhausted the Wagner fighters with their actions, so the enemy is now forced to engage special forces and air assault units in the battle for Bakhmut,"" Syrskyi said in the statement. ""The fighting is fierce on both sides."" ""The enemy has switched to the so-called 'Syrian' scorched Earth tactics. It is destroying buildings and positions with air strikes and artillery fire,"" he said.  ""The defense of Bakhmut continues. The situation is difficult but under control,"" he added.  On Monday, the Ukrainian military General Staff said in its latest operational update that Russia continues to focus its main efforts on offensive operations in the areas of Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Mariinka.  On Sunday, Ukrainian defenders repelled 58 enemy attacks on these axes, the General Staff said.  Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have revealed how the US spies on allies and foes alike — with leaked conversations including those about the war in Ukraine and international efforts to supply aid. One document reviewed by CNN describes, in remarkable detail, a conversation between two senior South Korean national security officials about concerns by the country’s National Security Council over a US request for ammunition. The officials worried that supplying the ammunition, which the US would then send to Ukraine, would violate South Korea’s policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war. According to the document, one of the officials then suggested a way of getting around the policy without actually changing it – by selling the ammunition to Poland. Seoul's response: The document has already sparked controversy in Seoul, with the country's presidential office saying on Sunday it would hold “necessary discussions with the US” regarding the leak. “We are well aware of the report, and we will hold necessary discussions with the US about the issues that have been raised,” the presidential office told reporters in a briefing. The office said the government will “review precedents and other countries’ cases, and come up with our response accordingly.”  South Korea’s policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war remains unchanged, the office said. Read the full story here. ##Pentagon Docs## The massive leak also reveals that US penetration of Russia’s Defense Ministry and the mercenary organization Wagner Group goes deeper than previously understood. Much of the information about Russia was gathered via intercepted communications, raising concerns that the Russians might now change their method of communication to better conceal their planning. Human sources could be at risk too. Maps of Russian troop movements and capabilities included in the trove of documents are sourced in part to human confidential sources, prompting fears among US officials that those assets could now be in danger. What was eavesdropped: The documents show that the US has been able to intercept Russian targeting plans, down to which exact thermoelectric power plants, electric substations and railroad and vehicle bridges Russian forces planned to attack inside Ukraine and when. The US was also able to intercept the Russian strategy for combating NATO tanks due to enter Ukraine beginning in April. The plan “called for establishing three fire zones based on range – long, medium, and short – with each zone covered by specific weaponry and unit types,” the US intelligence report says. Highlighting US concerns about the Wagner Group, which has thousands of personnel operating in Ukraine, the documents discuss Wagner’s renewed recruitment of Russian prisoners to fight in Ukraine – underscoring its leader’s “continued influence with Putin,” one report says – and the group’s plans to strengthen its presence across Africa and in Haiti. Rising casualties: The documents also provide a window into casualty figures on both sides, numbers that are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately and that the US has been reluctant to share publicly in detail. According to one of the documents, Russian forces had suffered 189,500 to 223,000 casualties as of February, including as many as 43,000 troops killed in action. Ukraine, meanwhile, had suffered 124,500 to 131,000 casualties, with up to 17,500 killed in action, the report says.

CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. One document reveals that the US has been spying on Zelensky. That is unsurprising, said the source close to the President, but Ukrainian officials are deeply frustrated about the leak. War plans: The US intelligence report, which is sourced to signals intelligence, says that Zelensky in late February “suggested striking Russian deployment locations in Russia’s Rostov Oblast” using unmanned aerial vehicles, since Ukraine does not have long-range weapons capable of reaching that far. Signals intelligence includes intercepted communications and is broadly defined by the National Security Agency as “intelligence derived from electronic signals and systems used by foreign targets, such as communications systems, radars, and weapons systems.” The intelligence could explain public US comments about not wanting to give Ukraine long-range missile systems over fears that Kyiv will use them to strike inside Russia. But Ukraine has pledged not to use US-provided weapons to do so. Ukraine's response: Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said on his Telegram channel Friday that he believes the documents that have been disseminated are inauthentic, have “nothing to do with Ukraine’s real plans” and are based on “a large amount of fictitious information” disseminated by Russia. Read the full story here. ##Pentagon Docs## A massive leak of classified Pentagon documents reveal the US' efforts in spying on Russia, with details of intercepted communications of Russia's Defense Ministry and the mercenary organization Wagner Group.  The documents also divulge weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry — reportedly forcing the country's military to alter some plans as fighting continues in eastern Ukraine, with a deadly attack by Russian forces on Easter Sunday. Here's the latest headlines out of Russia's war on Ukraine today: The leak: The documents expose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine, as well as its foes such as Moscow — raising concerns that the Russians might now change their method of communication to better conceal their planning.
            Holiday attack: Russian strikes killed a 50-year-old man and his 11-year-old daughter in the city of Zaporizhzhia early Sunday, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. “This is how the terrorist state spends this Palm Sunday,” said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, referring to the holiday in the eastern Orthodox tradition, as other Christians celebrate Easter Sunday.
            Battle for Bakhmut: Russian forces continue their campaign to take the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, with Wagner mercenary fighters, Russian paratroopers and infantry soldiers deployed to the area. But Ukrainian forces are still holding their positions and the supply route is still open, a military spokesperson said Sunday.
            Abandoned towns: When CNN visited eastern Ukraine recently, it found largely abandoned towns, destroyed homes and hungry stray dogs. Only those too elderly, infirm or impoverished to escape remain. “I’m on the last breath of survival,” one told CNN. ##Catch Up## Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Some of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, expose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine. Others reveal the degree to which the US has penetrated the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group, largely through intercepted communications and human sources, which could now be cut off or put in danger. Still others divulge key weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces gear up to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians – and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of the leak, a source close to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN. The leak has also led the Pentagon to take steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, officials said, which are normally available on any given day to hundreds of people across the government. Read more here. ##Pentagon Docs## Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed Russia during his nightly speech Sunday for the deadly attack reported by Ukraine's emergency service in Zaporizhzhia overnight. ""This is how the terrorist state spends this Palm Sunday,"" Zelensky said, referring to today's holiday in the eastern Orthodox tradition, as other Christians celebrate Easter Sunday. At least two people were killed when Russian strikes hit the southern city overnight, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service. A 50-year-old man and his 11-year-old daughter were killed after the strikes partially destroyed a residential building, officials said on Telegram. Rescuers pulled a 46-year-old woman out of the rubble, it added.  ""This is how Russia puts itself in even greater isolation from the world, from humanity,"" Zelensky said. Seven-year-old Karolina plays the piano at the Ukraine House cultural center in the United States capital, poking at keys, swinging her sneakers underneath. She could be any child playing the piano — except the legs swinging below the bench are prosthetic. Karolina lost her legs last fall in a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Nikopol and came to the United States to receive treatment. Sitting with Karolina is Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, who helped arrange the young girl’s care. Visits like these are now typical for the wartime ambassador. “It’s running a marathon and just doing every day whatever you can do, in order to move our country a little bit closer to the victory,” Markarova told CNN at the Ukrainian Embassy late last month. “It’s definitely a very difficult, very demanding experience.” This month marks two years since Markarova became ambassador. She was less than a year into her post when Russian leader Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. “We were preparing for it,” she recalled. “We knew that the intent to attack us was there, but you never completely believe until, unfortunately, something horrific like war happens.” Markarova said that for the first couple of months of the war she would wake up and wonder if it was a bad dream. “Everyone in Ukraine, of course, it’s more difficult for them,” she acknowledged. “As I say always, the bombs are not falling on us here – but we work literally 24/7 since February 24, and we will continue working like that until we win.” All around Washington: These days, much of Markarova’s time is spent outside the embassy, shuttling between various government agencies around Washington. On a recent car ride from the Capitol to the Commerce Department for one of those meetings, Markarova noted the cars she uses have become “a second office.” “This is where I prepare between the meetings, drive around everywhere,” she told CNN from the back seat. The former private equity associate said she is not only working on securing military aid from Congress but also seeking support from American companies and entities as Ukraine begins rebuilding. While House Republicans are divided over helping Ukraine, Markarova said she doesn’t see a difference with the chamber’s new GOP majority. She conceded, however, that there are members she has to “talk to more.” Markarova hopes the burgeoning political debate will not weaken support overall. Read CNN's full profile on Markarova here. The battles inside the eastern town of Bakhmut, Ukraine, are ""the most difficult ones since you are very close to the enemy,"" Serhiy Cherevaty, a spokesperson for the Eastern Grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said on national television Sunday.  ""But the supply route is still open and Ukrainian forces are holding their positions,"" he said.  Wagner mercenary fighters have been ""the most aggressive in the Bakhmut direction"" but Russian paratroopers and infantry soldiers are also fighting in Bakhmut and in the area, he said. ""Russians still hold a significant advantage in artillery in the areas of their main attack,"" he said.  ""We are supplying Bakhmut with ammunition, food and supplies, as well as taking our wounded out,"" Cherevaty, said. Moscow's recent push: Russian forces continue their push to take ""full control"" of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military said in its latest operational update Sunday morning. Unofficial reports suggest Russian forces are maintaining their slow advance through the center of Bakhmut and into the western parts of the city, with the railway station as a potential next key target. Yuriy Syrotyuk, a grenade launcher in Ukraine's military, said in an interview on national television Sunday that the situation in Bakhmut is ""really hard"" for Kyiv's forces, as they are outnumbered by Russian troops and Wagner fighters.  ""Bakhmut stands; there is a supply"" but ""Russians outnumber us and hold more ammunition,"" Syrotyuk said.  ""It's hell in Bakhmut. We are currently holding the right flank of the city's defense. The enemy artillery is shooting non-stop, as well as (multiple rocket launcher fire) and aviation,"" he said.  ""It is really hard now because Russian artillery and tanks have pulled up very close, they are trying to shoot everything. (Enemy) paratroopers with weapons have arrived. Unfortunately, the enemy is fine with weapons. In Bakhmut they have no shortage of personnel or ammunition,"" he added.  The Russian offensive on the southern flank of the city has weakened, ""which is why they are trying to attack head-on through the city,"" Syrotyuk said. Russia has moved its artillery and rocket launchers within the city's boundaries. ""The enemy is destroying everything and proceeding through the ruins,"" but the supply road to Bakhmut is open, Syrotyuk said. 
            ""I was on the southern outskirts of Bakhmut this morning. We left OK. Yes, the enemy is shelling the road, yes it is dangerous. However, there are supplies, the defense is properly organized and there is even a rotation. Look, we were able to leave, to wash up, and will come back,"" he added, noting he had taken a brief break from the fighting to rest and participate in the interview.

                      Israeli forces shot and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in the Aqbat Jaber refugee camp near the occupied West Bank city of Jericho, Palestinian officials said, as violence in the region continued to simmer on Monday.  Mohammad Fayez Balhan was ""killed by live occupation bullets in the head, chest and abdomen,"" the ministry said, adding that two other people were injured by live ammunition and sent to a hospital in Jericho for treatment. The Israeli military said they raided the camp to arrest a ""terror suspect.""  ""During the activity, violent riots were instigated in a number of locations,"" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. ""As the soldiers left the area, suspects opened fire toward them, hurled explosive devices and Molotov cocktails. The soldiers responded with live fire and .22 caliber ammunition. Hits were identified.""  Tensions in Israel and the occupied West Bank have spiraled in the aftermath of recent Israeli police raids on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.  Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh warned that images of Israeli forces storming the mosque had ""created an incredible mood of anger among every Palestinian, wherever they are -- in Gaza, in Ramallah, in the West Bank, in Lebanon, in Syria,"" and called on Israel to deescalate the situation. ""There is a mood of anger that is there in the heart and mind of every Palestinian,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.    Over the last week, dozens of rockets were launched from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria into Israeli territory, followed by Israeli retaliatory strikes.  On Friday, a vehicle hit a group of tourists in Tel Aviv, killing one Italian national, in what Israeli authorities described as a terror attack. Two sisters, aged 15 and 20, with dual British-Israeli citizenship were also killed Friday in a shooting attack in the West Bank. On Monday, the mother of the women, Lucy Dee, succumbed to wounds sustained during the shooting.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the shooting as a ""severe terrorist attack.""  ""On behalf of all citizens of Israel, I convey heartfelt condolences to the Dee family on the passing of the mother of the family, Leah (Lucy), who was murdered in the severe terrorist attack in the Jordan Valley last Friday, together with her two daughters Maia and Rina,"" Netanyahu said in a statement Monday.     Netanyahu on Friday instructed Israeli police ""to mobilize all border police units in reserve and the IDF to mobilize additional forces in face of terrorist attacks,"" according to his office. The Israeli military said it was on high alert, calling up an unspecified number of reservists amid what it described as ""very volatile times."" Also on Monday, thousands of Israeli settlers staged a march to Evyatar, an illegal settler outpost in the occupied West Bank that has been a flashpoint for Israel's settler movement. Far-right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Givr, among those who have spearheaded a campaign to legalize the outpost, was among the protesters. Evyatar sits on a hilltop, along a corridor linking Tel Aviv to the Jordan Valley, known locally as Jabal Subeih. Palestinians who say they own land in the site have been holding counter-protests.  Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians close to the nearby town of Beita led to nearly hundreds of injuries, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.  The Palestinian Red Crescent said 216 people were injured in the clashes, including 22 people hit by rubber bullets which, they say, were fired by Israeli forces. Three people were transferred to hospital, it also said. In a statement, the IDF said ""a violent riot"" had been instigated near Beita, adding that ""rocks were hurled at the soldiers, lightly injuring two IDF soldiers"" and ""security forces at the scene responded with riot dispersal means."" Asked about video shared on social media that appeared to show Israeli forces throwing tear gas canisters at journalists in the area, the Israel Police released a statement saying it ""appears that the security forces failed to adhere to the established rules and guidelines"" in ensuring freedom of the press. Palestinians in Beita, which is just south of Nablus, say they own the land at Evyatar.  Israeli settlers left Evyatar in 2021 after a deal with the government of then-Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. The buildings remained as part of the government's deal with the settlers. ""The land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel, belongs to us,"" Knesset member Ariel Kallner, of Netanyahu's Likud party, told CNN. ""I think that those who live here, the Arabs and so on, they can live here. But it's our land.""  Under international law, both the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered occupied territory and settlements there illegal, which Israel disputes.  Nabil Abu Radina, a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the march as an ""invasion of settler militias, led by ministers from the Israeli occupation government."" Abu Radina also demanded than ""immediate and quick intervention"" by the US government to ""stop this madness for which the entire region will pay the price.""

                      At least 3 people were wounded by gunfire during an apparent fight at a Delaware mall food court Saturday evening, according to state police. Police were called to the Christiana Mall in Newark around 6:43 p.m. local time Saturday, where they found three individuals with gunshot wounds in the area of the food court. They were all taken to area hospitals, two of them in critical condition, said Delaware State Police Senior Cpl. Jason Hatchell. Five other people were also taken to a hospital after they ""sustained various injuries not related to gunfire,"" the corporal said. No shooting suspect was in custody Saturday night, Hatchell said, adding that ""it has not been confirmed how many suspects were involved. Investigators are actively working to identify the suspects."" The shooting was not a random one, Hatchell said. ""Investigators believe this is a result of an altercation between several suspects and at least one of the victims,"" Hatchell said. With the investigation still in its early stages, Hatchell said it's unknown whether any of the victims and suspects knew each other previously. The shooting prompted police to evacuate and close the mall as law enforcement converged on the scene, which was searched and cleared. ""There is no threat to public safety,"" the corporal said later Saturday. Investigators were still on scene collecting evidence, examining surveillance video and speaking with witnesses Saturday, and the the mall will stay closed Sunday as the investigation continues, Hatchell said. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the location of the incident. It is the Christiana Mall.

                      Almost 90% of mpox-related deaths in the United States were among Black men, and nearly all had weakened immune systems, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From May 2022 to March 2023, 30,235 people in the US were diagnosed with mpox, previously known as monkeypox. Thirty-eight deaths were linked to mpox; 36 of them were men, and 33 were Black men. The average age of those who died was 34. Mpox spreads through close contact, and it can infect anyone. during the 2022 outbreak, infections were mostly among gay or bisexual men or other men who have sex with men.  Most people hospitalized for severe cases of mpox were Black men with uncontrolled HIV that may have caused a weakened immune system, according to the report, which was published Thursday. Although most of the people who died got one or more prompt treatments and intensive care, nearly a quarter had delays of three to seven weeks from diagnosis to treatment, and two got no treatment for mpox. ""These findings highlight the importance of integrating prevention, testing, and treatment for multiple sexually associated infections,"" the report says. ""Equitable access to prevention, treatment, and engagement and retention in care for both mpox and HIV should be prioritized, particularly among Black men and other persons at risk for sexually associated infections."" A separate CDC report published Thursday urged equity-based strategies, such as tailored messages and expanded vaccine services, to increase vaccination among racial and ethnic minorities.  Early in last year's outbreak, vaccination rates were lower among Black and Hispanic men than among White men, but by August, rates among Black and Hispanic men exceeded those among White men. However, the vaccination-to-case ratio was lower among Black and Hispanic men, and vaccination rates were not proportionate to the ""elevated incidence rates"" among Black men, the report said, leaving vaccination needs unmet.  Between May and December 2022, 723,112 people in the US received the first of two doses of the mpox vaccine, and 89.7% of the doses were given to men.  ""Continued implementation of equity-based vaccination strategies is needed to further increase vaccination rates and reduce the incidence of mpox among all racial and ethnic groups,"" the report says.  More than 30,000 people have been diagnosed with mpox in the United States as of Wednesday, and 42 people have died, according to the CDC.

                      About 100,000 registered nurses in the US left the workplace due to the stresses of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the results of a survey published Thursday by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.  Another 610,388 registered nurses, who had more than 10 years of experience and an average age of 57, said they planned to leave the workforce by 2027 because of stress, burnout or retirement. The same was true of 189,000 additional nurses with 10 or fewer years of experience and an average age of 36.  The survey found that there were over 5.2 million active registered nurses and 973,788 licensed practical nurses or vocational nurses in the US in 2022. The researchers analyzed data from 29,472 registered and advanced nurses and more than 24,000 licensed practical or vocational nurses across 45 states. More than a quarter of those surveyed said they plan to leave the industry or retire in the next five years, the study says.  About 62% of the nurses surveyed said their workload increased during the pandemic, and 50.8% said they felt emotionally drained at work.  Almost half of nurses said they felt fatigued or burnt-out: 49.7% and 45.1%, respectively. These concerns were seen most in nurses with less than 10 years of experience.  Maryann Alexander, chief officer of nursing regulation at NCSBN and one of the authors of this study, said she is shocked by the findings of the study, especially related to younger nurses.  Soon, the industry will rely on nurses with less than 10 years of experience to act as mentors, managers and leaders in nursing care, Alexander said. ""It will send us into a health care crisis of huge proportions,"" Alexander said.  She said that while it is common to see young nurses leaving the industry to go back to school and get more education,  it is uncommon to see young nurses leaving due to stress and burnout.  ""That is a huge cause for concern,"" Alexander said.  This exhausted tone was a driving factor behind a strike in New York in January, when over 7,000 nurses took to the streets to call attention to staffing shortages and burnout.  ""We are sick and tired of the hospital only doing the bare minimum,"" said Danny Fuentes, a union official who spoke to the crowd during the strike. ""Time and time again, we are forced to take unsafe patient loads. We are humans, and we are burnt-out. And we are tired. And the hospital doesn't seem to care. All they see are profits. We don't want to be out here. We would much rather be with our patients. We need a fair contract to protect our patients."" The strike ended when the New York State Nurses Association reached tentative deals with the two hospitals involved, Mount Sinai Health System and Montefiore Health System. The union said the deal would provide enforceable ""safe staffing ratios"" for all inpatient units at Mount Sinai and Montefiore.  Montefiore agreed to financial penalties for failing to comply with agreed-upon staffing levels in all units. The researchers on the new survey say their findings pose a threat to the US workforce, especially among younger and less experienced nurses. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing says hospitals and policymakers should be quick to enact solutions and address these challenges.

                      The suicide rate in the United States returned to a near-record high in 2021, reversing two years of decline, according to a report released Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Final data for the year shows that suicide was the 11th leading cause of death nationwide, with more than 14 deaths for every 100,000 people. The death rate has increased 32% over the past two decades, and the 4% jump between 2020 and 2021 was the sharpest annual increase in that timeframe. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 34 and fifth for people ages 35 to 54. The suicide death rate was four times higher among men than women in 2021, CDC data shows, as it has been in many years prior. Rates increased significantly for men of most ages between 2020 and 2021 but were relatively unchanged for women of most ages, except for a significant rise among those 75 and older. Rates were highest among American Indian people -- about twice as high as average for men and three times as high for women -- and rates spiked about 17% between 2020 and 2021. Rates also increased significantly for Black and White men and women. Another report published Thursday by the CDC shows that adolescents were the age group most likely to visit the emergency department for suicidal thoughts in recent years. Children are facing increasing mental health challenges, with significant shares of both teen girls (57%) and boys (29%) saying they felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021. Nearly 1 in 3 teen girls said they seriously considered attempting suicide, a recent CDC survey found. But growing demand for services is matched with a nationwide shortage of beds for children who need mental health help, leaving many children waiting in emergency department beds and crowding hospitals.

                      At age 14, Helen wasn't bothered by the fact she was born via surrogacy. ""My mum is still my mum. My dad is still my dad,"" she told UK researchers conducting a study on the mental health and well-being of children born through egg donation, sperm donation and surrogacy. Helen is not her real name. ""I was talking to someone at school and they said they were an accident,"" 14-year-old Simon (also not his real name) told the researchers. ""I know I was no accident, I was really wanted, and it makes me feel special.""  Parents worried their children may experience difficulties as a result of learning they were conceived by assisted reproduction can stop fretting — the kids are just fine, according to the study published this week after two decades in the making.  ""When we began this study more than 20 years ago, there was concern the absence of a biological link between the child and the parents could have a damaging effect on their relationship and on the well-being of the child,"" said lead author Susan Golombok, professor emerita of family research and former director of the Centre for Family Research at the University of Cambridge in the UK. However, at age 20, children born via egg or sperm donation and surrogacy were psychologically well-adjusted, the study found, especially if parents told the children about their birth history before age 7. ""What this research means is that having children in different or new ways doesn't actually interfere with how families function. Really wanting children seems to trump everything — that's what really matters,"" Golombok said.  Clinical psychologist Mary Riddle, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University called the study ""important, in that it represents research conducted over a long period of time."" However, Riddle, who was not involved in the study, said the results aren't completely applicable to the United States because surrogacy can be practiced differently in the UK in several ways. Called ""tummy mummies"" by some of the children, surrogates in the UK may become part of the family, participating in the upbringing of the child they helped bring into the world, according to Golombok's 2020 book, ""We Are Family: The Modern Transformation of Parents and Children."" ""In the UK, intended parents often know their surrogate prior to the surrogate pregnancy whereas in the US, commercial surrogates are often matched through agencies and don't have prior relationships with the families for whom they carry babies,"" Riddle said. It's also more common in the UK to use ""partial"" surrogacy, in which surrogates are impregnated with the sperm of the intended father and are therefore the biological mother of the child, Riddle said.  ""Here in the US, gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother has no genetic connection to the child she is carrying, is far more common and thought to be potentially less fraught with psychological and legal pitfalls,"" she added. Telling a child early helps The study, published Wednesday in the journal Developmental Psychology, followed 65 children — 22 born by surrogacy, 17 by egg donation and 26 by sperm donation — from infancy until age 20. Another 52 families who did not use any assistance were also followed. Researchers spoke to the families when the children were 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and 14. Young adults who learned about their biological origins before age 7 reported better relationships with their mothers, and their mothers had lower levels of anxiety and depression, the study found. However, children born through surrogacy had some relationship issues around age 7, ""which seemed to be related to their increased understanding of surrogacy at that age,"" Golombok said.  ""We visited the families when the children were 10, and these difficulties had disappeared,"" she said. ""Interestingly, the same phenomenon has been found among internationally adopted children. It may have to do with having to confront issues of identity at a younger age than other children."" Developmentally, children begin to notice and ask questions about pregnancy between the ages of 3 and 4, said clinical psychologist Rebecca Berry, an adjunct faculty member in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine. ""To satisfy their curiosity they'll begin to ask questions about babies and where they came from as a way of trying to understand why they are here,"" said Berry, who was not involved with the study. Children as young as 7 will already have a basic understanding of genetics, and can be surprised when they learn they aren't genetically connected to one or both parents, said Lauri Pasch, a psychology professor at the University of California San Francisco, who specializes in infertility and family building. ""Our current thinking is that it is best for parents to share the story of donor conception with their children at a very early age, so that if I were to ask their child when they are an adult when they learned that they were donor conceived, they would respond that they 'always knew,'"" said Pasch, who was also not involved in the study, via email. ""This allows the child to grow up with the information, as opposed to learning it later in life, when it comes as a surprise or shock and can hurt their trust in their parents and their identity development,"" she added. A few differences When it came to maternal anxiety and depression, there were no differences between families formed by surrogacy and egg or sperm donation and families with children born without assisted conception. Nor were they any differences in the mothers' relationships with their partners at home, the study found. However, mothers who had babies via donor eggs reported less positive family relationships than mothers who used sperm donation, likely due to insecurities about lack of a genetic connection to their children, Golombok said. Young adults conceived by sperm donation reported poorer family communication than those conceived by egg donation, the study found. That's perhaps due to a greater reluctance on the part of fathers to disclose they are not a genetic parent, Golombok said.  Only 42% of parents who had conceived via sperm donor had revealed the child's birth history by the time their children were age 20, compared to 88% of egg donation parents and 100% of  parents who used surrogacy. When asked, many of the children said they weren't concerned about how they were conceived.  ""A lot of the children said 'It's not a big deal. I've got more interesting things going on in my life,' while others said 'Actually it's something a bit special about me. I like talking about it,' Golombok said. ""I think it's really nice to hear from the children themselves and I don't think any other study has done this."" Once told, a child needs to revisit the birth history from time to time, so parents should be sure any conversation is an ongoing one, Golombok said. ""There is this idea parents will tell the child and that is it. But you need to keep having these conversations to give the child a chance to ask questions in an age appropriate way as they grow older,"" she said. ""Many of the parents in our study use children's books that were specifically designed for this purpose,"" Golombok added. ""Then they could bring the child's own story into the narrative.""

                      Concerned about the courts, some states and universities are stockpiling abortion drugs

                      With an eye on the courts, a growing number of Democratic-led states are stockpiling the pills that can be used for a medication abortion, the most common form of the procedure in the US. The officials want to be prepared, in case US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone goes through, so medication abortions would still be available in their states for some period of time. But they're taking different approaches to the idea. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday that her state's Department of Health would buy 150,000 doses of misoprostol, the other of the two drugs typically used in a medication abortion. Misoprostol can be used off-label for an abortion, without mifepristone, but patients often have to use more of it. It would not be covered by the court case, and if Kacsmaryk's decision stands, the New York City's Health Department tweeted, it will change to using this medication only. ""Medication abortion continues to be available at our Sexual Health Clinics and NYC Health + Hospitals locations. Should mifepristone become unavailable, we will continue to make medication abortion accessible to all in NYC by shifting to a misoprostol-only treatment regimen,"" the tweet said.  The state says the 150,000 doses should represent a five-year supply of pills. ""Anti-choice extremists have shown that they are not stopping at overturning Roe, and they are working to entirely dismantle our country's reproductive health care system, including medication abortion and contraception,"" Hochul said. ""New York will always be a safe harbor for abortion care, and I am taking action to protect abortion access in our State and continue to lead the nation in defending the right to reproductive autonomy."" California is also stocking up on misoprostol. ""While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday's ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a release Monday. California plans to purchase up to 2 million pills through CalRx, a state initiative set up to make drugs more affordable.  The governor's office said the state now has more than 250,000 pills on hand, which it purchased for about $100,000.  California said it shared the terms of its purchase agreement with other members of the Reproductive Freedom Alliance, a nonpartisan coalition of 21 governors who are committed to protecting reproductive rights, and who might also be interested in taking such action. Another member of that alliance, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, announced last week that his state bought a three year-supply of mifepristone, the drug at the center of Kacsmaryk's ruling.  Inslee directed the state Department of Corrections -- which has a pharmacy license and is legally able to buy medications -- to buy the drug last month, he said, and the shipment was delivered March 31. The University of Washington also purchased 10,000 doses.  Lawmakers are introducing a bill to authorize officials to distribute or sell the medication to licensed providers throughout the state. ""This Texas lawsuit is a clear and present danger to patients and providers all across the country. Washington will not sit by idly and risk the devastating consequences of inaction,"" Inslee said. ""Washington is a pro-choice state, and no Texas judge will order us otherwise."" In the meantime, its attorney general, Bob Ferguson, is helping lead a multistate lawsuit to protect access to mifepristone.  On Friday, the same day Kacsmaryk's ruling came down, a federal judge in Washington ordered the US not to make any changes that would restrict access to mifepristone in the territories that brought the lawsuit: 17 states and the District of Columbia.  On Monday, Massachusetts Gov. Maura T. Healey announced that at her request, the University of Massachusetts and health care providers have also taken action to stockpile doses of mifepristone. The governor's office said last week that the university bought about 15,000 doses of mifepristone, enough to cover the commonwealth for about a year, and the pills are expected to arrive this week. Local health care providers have agreed to buy more, and the government agreed to set aside $1 million to pay for those doses. The Massachusetts governor also signed an executive order confirming protections for medication abortion under existing law.  ""Here in Massachusetts, we are not going to let one extremist judge in Texas turn back the clock on this proven medication and restrict access to care in our state,""  Healey said. ""The action we are taking today protects access to mifepristone in Massachusetts and protects patients and providers from liability. In Massachusetts, we stand for civil rights and freedom. We will always protect access to reproductive health care, including medication abortion.""  Danco Laboratories, the manufacturer of the brand-name version of mifepristone, says that orders for the drug have increased substantially in recent months and are significantly higher than they were at this time last year.  Demand for mifepristone is up across all types of customers, including clinics, pharmacies and individual providers, said Abby Long, Danco's director of public affairs. But Massachusetts is the only state that has requested an especially large number of pills from the company. Maine Gov. Janet Mills, who called the Texas decision ""reckless"" and a ""fundamental assault on women's rights,"" said Monday that her administration is evaluating its options, ""including procuring mifepristone if needed, to protect access to medication abortion for Maine women.""  The Connecticut governor's office said Wednesday that it is also monitoring the situation.  Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek's office said in an email Wednesday that she has directed the Oregon Health Authority to ""explore all available avenues for ensuring Oregon is prepared should Mifepristone become less available. That includes evaluating the supply of Mifepristone and Misoprostol and consulting with providers to better understand the potential impact on the provision of abortion and reproductive health care and what additional support might be necessary.""

                      The White House has declared that the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl combined with xylazine -- an animal tranquilizer that's increasingly being used in illicit drugs -- is an ""emerging threat"" facing the United States due to its role in the ongoing opioid crisis.  Administration officials call the threat FAAX, for fentanyl-adulterated or -associated xylazine.  The move, announced Wednesday, marks the first time in history that any administration has declared a substance to be an emerging threat to the country, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 established that the office has authority to declare such ""emerging threats,"" and no administration has used it until now. Last year, Congress declared methamphetamine an emerging drug threat but none have been declared by an administration previously. Under other agencies or in separate circumstances, concerns such as bioterrorism, infectious diseases or climate change may be identified as ""emerging threats."" ""This drug, which is an animal sedative, is being mixed with fentanyl and is being found in almost all 50 states now,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""It's become an important part for us to make sure that we're declaring it an emerging threat."" Now that the administration has declared fentanyl combined with xylazine an emerging threat, it has 90 days to coordinate a national response. ""We are working quickly to develop and implement a whole of government nationwide plan, with real deliverable action, that will save lives and will be published within 90 days of this designation,"" Gupta said. Xylazine, also known as tranq or tranq dope, has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths in the United States due to its rising illicit use. Between 2020 and 2021, overdose deaths involving xylazine increased more than 1,000% in the South, 750% in the West and about 500% in the Midwest, according to an intelligence report released last year by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. And in some cases, people might not even know that xylazine was in the drug they used. Just last month, authorities at the DEA issued a public safety alert about the ""widespread threat"" of fentanyl mixed with xylazine, reporting that in 2022 approximately 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine. Fentanyl, which has been driving the opioid crisis, is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high the drug provides.  Xylazine is not an opioid. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine, typically in horses, but it is not approved for use in humans. And xylazine can do major damage to the human body, including leaving drug users with severe skin ulcers, soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. ""Xylazine is one of the contaminants in fentanyl, but there could be others,"" Gupta said. ""So, I think with the declaration of an emerging threat, we're sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit xylazine and illicit fentanyl that we're going to respond quicker, we're going to match the challenge of evolution of these drugs supply, and that we're going to protect lives first and foremost.""  'There is a shift that is occurring' Now that xylazine has been declared an emerging threat, some of President Biden's $46 billion drug budget request to Congress can be used to respond.  This year, the Biden administration announced that the President has called on Congress to invest $46.1 billion for agencies overseen by the Office of National Drug Control Policy to tackle the nation's illicit drug crisis. If the budget request is not approved, there could be the option to reallocate money within the Office of National Drug Control Policy, but ""we don't want to be in a position where moneys that are being utilized for some other important aspect of saving lives has to be moved away for this purpose,"" Gupta said Tuesday. ""That is the reason we are asking Congress to act."" Such funds could be used to test drugs on the street for xylazine, collect data on FAAX, invest in care for people exposed to FAAX and develop potential treatments for a xylazine-related overdose.  The medication naloxone, also known as Narcan, is an antidote for an opioid overdose, but people who have overdosed on a combination of opioids and xylazine may not immediately wake up after taking naloxone, as it may not reverse the effects of xylazine in the same way it does opioids. ""We need to recognize, first of all, that there is a shift that is occurring from organic compounds and substances like heroin and cocaine to more synthetics,"" Gupta said of the state of the nation's illicit drug crisis.  ""Both the types of drugs have changed -- from predominantly organic to predominantly synthetics -- but the way drugs are bought and sold have also changed,"" he said. ""Now, all you need is a phone in the palm of your hand and a social media app to order and buy some of the most dangerous substances on planet Earth."" Rise of synthetic drugs Xylazine is just one of the many adulterants -- or substances that are typically added to others -- found in the nation's illicit drug supply. ""All of a sudden, you can synthesize hundreds of compounds and kind of mix them together and see what does the best in the market,"" Joseph Friedman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in March. ""People are synthesizing new benzodiazepines, new stimulants, new cannabinoids constantly and adding them into the drug supply. So people have no idea what they're buying and what they're consuming."" Some of these adulterants may be as simple as sugar or artificial sweeteners added for taste or additives or fillers that bulk up the drug. Sometimes, they may be contaminants left over from the manufacturing process.  But all of these things can carry real-life health harms, says Naburan Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and senior scientist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Like an opioid, xylazine can depress the respiratory system, so the risk of overdose multiplies when it's combined with heroin or fentanyl. Also, ""in the veterinary literature, we know that it causes a really bad severe form of anemia. And so when people are injecting heroin that's contaminated with xylazine, they can end up with a near-fatal form of blood iron deficiency,"" Dasgupta said in March. ""We had one person here who ended up going to the hospital needing multiple blood transfusions. And it was all because of the xylazine."" Move to make xylazine a controlled substance US lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine as a controlled substance. In March, bipartisan legislation -- the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act -- was introduced in the House and Senate. It describes illicit xylazine as an ""urgent threat to public health and safety"" and calls for it to be a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl. ""Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said in a statement in March. The bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that the product is not being diverted to the black market. ""This bill recognizes the dangers posed by the increasing abuse of animal tranquilizers by drug traffickers, and provides new tools to combat this deadly trend,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the statement.  ""It also ensures that folks like veterinarians, ranchers and cattlemen can continue to access these drugs for bona fide animal treatment.""

                      What is autism? An expert explains

                    ","
                      Some individuals with autism have challenges processing senses. Others struggle to communicate. Still others might have a tough time socializing, thinking, physically moving or just going about daily living. People with autism have their own ways of interacting with the world, because autism is a developmental disability that affects everyone who has it a little differently, according to Dr. Daniel Geschwind, the Gordon and Virginia Macdonald distinguished professor of human genetics, neurology and psychiatry at UCLA. Geschwind has spent 25 years studying autism and what causes it. To mark Autism Awareness Month, CNN  talked with him about what autism is and what causes it. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What is autism?  Dr. Daniel Geschwind: Autism refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills and social and communication and repetitive behaviors, resistance to changes in routine, or restricted interests. I prefer to call it ""the Autisms,"" because it's not one thing, and no two autistic children or adults are exactly alike even though they may share basic features. People with autism may also have some sensory-motor integration issues, especially sensory hypersensitivity.   CNN: How prevalent is autism today? Geschwind: It isn't rare. The most recent statistics (from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) came out in March, pulled data from 11 sites (in the United States) and reported 1 out of every 36 kids is autistic. The study before that estimated around 1 in 40. About 10 years ago, the autism rate was 1 in 100, or even lower.  It would be easy to look at this trend and say autism is increasing, but that's not really what is happening. The most recent data reflects that our ability to recognize autism and diagnose it early has improved dramatically. We're now able to diagnose people with autism who might have (previously) fallen through the cracks. Everybody is neurodivergent to some extent. For example, if you look at a simple IQ test, a substantial portion of people will perform really badly on one specific item. That doesn't mean they have problems — it's just that it means we all have strengths and weaknesses. If I were being tested on artistic ability, for example, or engineering ability, I would be far below what's called typical. I think we have to accept that intelligence is not just one thing, that cognition isn't one thing, that there's not just one way to behave. CNN: What does it mean when people describe some as being ""on the spectrum""? Geschwind: About a decade ago, the term ""autism spectrum disorder"" was adopted to encompass everything that we called autism into one rubric. The intent was simply to describe the variability in how people with autism act and behave biomedically. There are some autistic individuals who just need accommodations and don't need treatment. There are other autistic individuals who need a lot of treatment. The spectrum was intended to include them all.  Over time, non-autistic people began referring to the spectrum in a linear fashion: high to low. That means some autistic individuals were categorized as ""high-functioning,"" while others were categorized as ""low-functioning."" For many, the notion of a spectrum is now a loaded term. Many believe that instead of talking about autism in a linear fashion, we should talk about it as a wheel or pie, where each slice represents a different trait and every individual has different strengths and weaknesses.   CNN: Is there a cure for autism? Geschwind: There is no cure. At the same time, we've come very far in understanding what autism is, and we're making progress on how to treat it. When I started researching autism 25 years ago, the autism rate was 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 2,000. To put it in deeper historical perspective, I think at that time there was only about $10 million a year or less in autism research being done that was funded (by the National Institutes of Health). And so, there was a huge disconnect between the research dollars, public awareness and the real needs of patients and families.  The notion of the term ""curing"" autism can be controversial. From my perspective, our true goal is to establish a kind of personalized medicine, or precision health in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders, so that each autistic person is seen as the individual they are. We envision a world where individuals who are severely impacted by autism have the opportunity to get therapy and drugs that can help them — and those for whom a therapy is not warranted or who don't want it will have opportunities to live life the way they want to as well. Patient autonomy and societal accommodation are important aspects when considering these issues.   CNN: What causes autism?  Geschwind: Almost every medical condition has both genetic and environmental components. In autism, it seems that heritability is very high. The most recent large study suggested that heritable genetic factors — the things that you get from your parents that your parents have in their DNA — are probably somewhere around 80% or slightly higher.  That leaves 20% that's nonheritable, and of that we know that at least 10% of autism is caused by rare mutations that are not inherited. And that sounds like a paradox, but it's not. If you think about Down syndrome, that's a genetic mutation that the parents don't have in their DNA. That's called a new, or de novo, mutation.  You can calculate a risk score for having autism based on genetics, (but) right now, the risk score for autism is not that predictive because we haven't done enough research. For other conditions like cardiovascular or certain cancers, risk scores are very predictive because very large numbers of people have been studied.  Even so, this autism risk score is strongly correlated with high educational attainment, or a high IQ, which again speaks to the strengths associated with being autistic and highlights that we need to be more aware of the strengths that autistic individuals may have as well to optimize their opportunities to achieve their goals or contribute to society.  There also are several environmental factors that have been shown to increase the risk of autism. One of them is maternal exposure to valproate, which is an anti-epilepsy medication. There are several maternal viral infections that have been associated with autism. And two other things: the interbirth interval — how quickly after one birth a mother has another — and the age of the father. The thought on the last point is that as a man ages, their DNA repair mechanisms are maybe less active, and there are more frequent mutations in sperm.  A key point is that all these known environmental factors act prenatally, so in most cases the tendency towards being on the spectrum is something that individuals are born with.   CNN: To what extent has research debunked the controversial notion that vaccines can cause autism? Geschwind: The notion that vaccines cause autism has been entirely (disproved). There have been dozens of studies, using very different methodologies. There is absolutely no evidence that vaccines cause autism, and there's been much more harm than good done by purveyors of that fiction.   CNN: How do you treat autism?  Geschwind: It is imperative to have an early diagnosis, because we know that early identification and early intervention with behavioral therapies can be effective in up to 50% of kids. Some kids will respond so well that it's very hard to make a diagnosis of autism when they're 9 years old if the therapy is started early enough. The problem is that for many autistic individuals, current therapies are not that effective. There's a lot of work being done developing more effective cognitive behavioral therapies, figuring out which therapy is the best for which child. There's also work being done to develop medications that can be helpful to treat certain symptoms such as injurious behavior, repetitive behavior or difficulty with changes in routines.  My colleagues and I want to use treatment to augment and improve people's symptoms, not change who they are fundamentally. We believe strongly in every individual's autonomy. We also believe in personalized medicine so that it's not one-size-fits-all. There will be some patients in whom we're trying to correct a severe genetic mutation that has profound consequences, and there'll be others that need only a handful of accommodations, just like we provide for folks who need wheelchairs.   CNN: What will your research focus on next? Geschwind: There are two basic frontiers in my research. One recognizes that most of the work in neuropsychiatric disorders and autism has been done in primarily White European populations and focuses on a pressing need to be studying diverse populations. About seven or eight years ago, I started working with African American communities because certain aspects of genetics are population-specific, and we as researchers really need to understand that.   The frontier that is crosscutting across all of this is we need to be able to move from genetics in a population to genetics in an individual, so that by looking at somebody's genetic makeup, we can understand the mechanism of their autism. This is precision medicine.  My work is trying to understand how specific genetic variants, how specific mutations, impact brain development to eventually lead to the symptoms of autism. If my colleagues and I can understand that mechanism, just like we can understand the genetic mechanism in cancer, we can find a drug to target that and improve those symptoms over time.

                      'It just didn't enter my mind to initiate sex;' Low sex drive in men linked to chemical imbalance

                      While hanging out with his college roommates, Peter (not his real name) realized he felt differently about sex than other heterosexual men. ""I've never been somebody who was interested in pornography, but I'd laugh along with their jokes,"" said Peter, now 44, who is British. ""Of course I never mentioned that ... as a man, you'd be kicked out of the herd."" As he developed ""proper, serious relationships"" with women, Peter discovered he didn't have the sexual drive many of his partners did. ""I would make excuses around getting tired or feeling stressed, that kind of thing,"" he said. ""It wasn't an issue with attraction to my partner. It just didn't enter my mind to initiate sex."" In 2021, Peter saw an ad recruiting male volunteers for a new study on hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. Researchers planned to inject the study's participants with kisspeptin —a naturally occurring sexual hormone — to see if it increased their sex drive. Kisspeptin plays a key role in reproduction; without adequate levels of the hormone children do not go through puberty, for example. In a long-term, committed relationship with a woman he says has a higher sexual appetite, Peter signed up, intrigued by the thought that a biological imbalance might help explain his behavior. In the week after the final session, Peter said, something amazing occurred. ""All of a sudden, I wanted to initiate intimacy. I can only presume it was driven not by my mind remembering something, but my body wanting something,"" he said. ""I did initiate sex more and it improved things with my partner incredibly.""  Wiring in the brain Experts believe HSDD affects at least 10% of women and up to 8% of men, although those numbers may be low, said Stanley Althof, a professor emeritus of psychology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio and executive director of the Center for Marital and Sexual Health of South Florida. ""Men are embarrassed to go to the doctor to begin with, and you're supposed to be a macho guy,"" said Althof, who was not involved in the kisspeptin study.  ""So it's difficult for men to say, 'Hey, I've got a problem with my sex drive.' That's why the majority of male patients I see with HSDD are sent in by their partners.""   To be diagnosed with the disorder, a person must have no other issues that might cause a change in libido, such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.   ""Losing interest due to performance issues is common, but HSDD is its own thing,"" Althof said. ""It's an absence of erotic thoughts and a lack of desire for sex that has to be present for six months. It also cannot be better explained by another disorder or other stressors: It can't be due to depression. It can't be due to a bad relationship. It can't be due to taking an antidepressant."" One more key point: A man or woman must have clinically significant distress to have HSDD, said clinical psychologist Dr. Sheryl Kingsberg, a professor in reproductive biology and psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University, who was also not involved in the kisspeptin study. ""Some people aren't bothered by their lack of interest in sex, so we wouldn't treat them for HSDD,"" said Kingsberg, who is also chief of behavioral medicine at MacDonald Women's Hospital and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. ""The women coming into my office are deeply distressed,"" she said. ""They tell me 'I used to have desire but it's gone. I could be on a desert island with no pressures, but I just don't have the appetite. I want it back.' Those women have HSDD."" 'Surreal' experience Dr. Waljit Dhillo, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism at Imperial College London, has been studying the relationship between low sexual desire and the hormone kisspeptin for years, first in animals, then in people. Prior studies by Dhillo of healthy men with no libido problems found giving them kisspeptin boosted levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone, which is important for gonad function.  His newest study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open in February, enrolled 32 men with verified HSDD. Peter was one of them. ""So many people say to themselves, 'It's just me. I've got a problem.' But actually, HSDD may be how your brain is wired,"" said Dhillo, who is a dean at the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Research Academy in Newcastle upon Tyne. ""The biology is telling us there's increased activation of inhibitory areas in the brain — the same areas that tell us it's not OK to walk around in public naked — and those areas are switching off sexual desire. How can we tackle that? We give a hormone that would naturally give you increased sexual desire, essentially hijacking the normal system."" The men participating in the new study visited Dhillo's lab twice. On each occasion, they were fitted with a device to objectively measure arousal, given an injection and asked to watch pornography while their brains were scanned via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neither the subjects or the researchers knew if that day's injection was kisspeptin or a placebo. ""It was extraordinarily surreal, lying there with something resembling a hangman's noose around your bits and watching a mixture of '70s to modern-day pornographic images and videos,"" Peter said. ""You'd get about five or six seconds of one type of image or video, rate your arousal for the researchers, and then move on to the next.""  Brain scans showed a significant dual effect after the kisspeptin injection, Dhillo said. Activity in the areas of the brain that inhibit behavior slowed, while areas of the brain connected to sexual interest lit up. ""As a group, the men had a 56% higher sexual response to sexual images after the kisspeptin than the placebo,"" Dhillo said. ""And we found no side effects at the very, very small dose that we are using.""  Peter noticed a difference immediately after finishing the treatments. His sex life was so robust, in fact, that it wasn't long before his partner was pregnant with their first child. As published, the study did not follow the men long-term to see if the effects of kisspeptin lasted. For Peter, however, its impact has been life-changing. ""I have found there's been a lasting effect for me,"" he said. ""I do find I have a much better sexual appetite even now some years after the treatment."" Even the arrival of a baby boy didn't deter his new interest in sex. ""The cliche is when you have kids, your sex life takes a bit of a hit,"" he told CNN. ""But that hasn't been the case for us. In fact, we're pregnant with our second child, due in July."" More research is needed While Peter had a positive long-term result, it's too soon to say kisspeptin injections were the reason, Althof said.  ""When you hear dramatic results like Peter's, I would be cautious in saying that is the typical outcome. While it's wonderful that it happened for him, these fMRI studies are difficult to interpret and not conclusive,"" he said. ""Sexual desire is very complicated — I say it's a combination of brain function, hormones and love, wine and roses,"" Althof added. ""This study is promising, but it needs replication in larger groups."" And even if future research does confirm kisspeptin's benefits, medical treatment is not a substitution for healthy communication about sex between partners and with health care providers, Dhillo said.  ""These are society's taboos, but actually, the more we talk about real (sexual) issues that affect real people, the more we find it's actually quite common,"" he said.""If you're not troubled by low libido, it's not an issue at all, but if you are troubled by it, this can lead to marital breakdown, unhappiness and reduced quality of life.""

                      Police dogs are nothing new — but a bunny in uniform is something that sound more like a character in an animated children's movie than real-life recruit. Not anymore. ""We would like to introduce Wellness Officer Percy,"" wrote police department in Yuba City, California in a recent Facebook post, sharing a picture of a brown and white bunny rabbit in a tiny K9 police harness. ""Officer Percy lounges at the police department during the day and is a support animal for all."" Also known as ""Officer Hops,"" Percy is a part of the department's recent focus on promoting mental health support for their staff. He serves as an outlet for stress when he is in the office, and as a friendly face when he is out visiting in the community. ""Our wellness program promotes the importance of prioritizing mental and physical health, providing tools and resources to reduce stress and create a positive foundation for well-being,"" said the department in their Facebook post. Percy was found by Ashley Carson, a member of the police department, in the middle of a road last October. Carson took the rabbit to animal control once realizing he was domesticated, but he was never claimed, according to the department.  Newly-named after the road he was found on — Percy Avenue — the bunny was adopted by another staff member soon after. Therapy bunny Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular in recent years, with several studies reporting evidence of their health benefits, including the decrease of anxiety and depression in their owners.  A 2020 study found that petting an animal can boost cognitive and emotional brain activity, for example, while a 2022 study found that just 10 minutes with a therapy dog reduced pain in emergency room patients. ""Recognition of our mutually beneficial relationship with domesticated animals, and in particular companion animals, is ever evolving,"" said Colleen Dell, a sociology professor at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, via email. Dell has for years researched the relationships between humans and animals.  ""When our team first started researching the impact of therapy dogs visiting with university students ten years ago, there was somewhat limited recognition of their potentially important role in human's lives,"" Dell said. ""Today, therapy dogs are on many campuses across North America, and in spaces you would never have thought you would see (them), like a hospital emergency department."" It's important to keep in mind a support animal's feelings too, Dell noted, as any human-animal relationship can be complicated. Picking up on body language is important to monitor their wellness — in the case of Percy, purring can signal a happy bunny, whereas pushed-back ears likely mean the opposite. Percy's new position could also help bring attention to the wider welfare of his species, which is often neglected, according to Dell.  ""Bunnies are adored in North America for being cute, friendly and cuddly,"" Dell said. ""In face of what officers and others in the station may face in their jobs, this can serve as a nice counterbalance."" ""This is an excellent way to establish rapport with the community,"" she added. ""There is a strong message here to build upon, of respecting others, including animals.""

                      There were 32,000 fewer legal abortions in the US in the six months after the Dobbs decision, new analysis suggests

                      In the six months after the Supreme Court ruling that ended the federal right to an abortion, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions than expected in the United States, according to a new analysis.  There were about 5,000 fewer legal abortions each month, on average, than there were in the months before the ruling -- a drop of about 6%. In April and May, there were an average of about 82,000 abortions each month, according to the analysis. From July through December, that fell to an average of 77,000 abortions per month. The total number of abortions fluctuated month-to-month, but was always lower than it was in April.  The Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit focused on abortion and contraception, sponsored a research effort that collected data from abortion providers nationwide -- including clinics, private medical offices, hospitals and virtual clinics. More than 80% of known providers responded. Self-managed abortions that occur outside of the formal health care system were not included in the analysis. In the 13 states that enacted bans following the Supreme Court decision, abortions fell more than 95%, with just a few reported each month from July to December. But in the remaining set of states, the average number of abortions ticked up slightly. There were surges in some of those states, including Minnesota and Kansas, that suggest that individuals living in states with more restrictions may travel for care.  ""Those unable to overcome travel barriers are likely those with the fewest socioeconomic resources,"" the authors of the report wrote. ""Even small declines in the abortion rate still translate into enormous life impacts for those affected."" While the number of abortions declined overall, those provided virtually through telehealth increased each month and accounted for a growing share of abortions overall. There were more than 8,500 telehealth abortions in December, more than double compared with April.  Earlier research found that the average travel time to an abortion facility increased significantly for women in the US following the Supreme Court Decision. Dozens of clinics shuttered within the first month, and the average travel time to the closest facility more than tripled.

                      EPA proposes new regulations on toxic gas used to sterilize spices and medical equipment

                    ","
                      The US Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed a set of new restrictions on facilities that use the cancer-causing chemical ethylene oxide, a colorless, odorless gas that is used to sterilize medical devices and spices. The agency said the new rules, which have not been finalized, would help to reduce ethylene oxide gas that these facilities release by 80%, bringing emissions below a Clean Air Act standard for elevated cancer risk. Communities exposed to ethylene oxide gas have been pushing the EPA to put tighter controls on plants that use ethylene oxide gas. In 2018, an EPA report found that dozens of communities across the nation faced elevated cancer risks because of trace of amounts of ethylene oxide released into air as part of the sterilization process. The EPA issued the report on the new risks without issuing a news release, as it had done for the same report in years past. Some affected communities learned of the risk through a health assessment conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and media reports. A report from the EPA's Office of the Inspector General found that some communities weren't alerted to their risk by EPA at all. The elevated risk became apparent after a two-decade long review of the toxicity of ethylene oxide by scientists in EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program. While the EPA acknowledged that ethylene oxide was more dangerous that had been previously understood, it continued to use an older set of rules to regulate facilities that released ethylene oxide as well as companies that manufacture it. The proposed rules aim to better align regulations on the producers and users of ethylene oxide with the cancer risk posed by the chemical. They follow a set of proposed rules issued by EPA last week that would put new controls on facilities that manufacture ethylene oxide. Taken together, the two sets of rules would remove 77 tons of ethylene oxide emissions a year, an 84% reduction compared with 2020 levels, EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said in a call with reporters on Tuesday. Environmental watchdog groups applauded the proposed restrictions, but noted that they don't go far enough to protect vulnerable communities, where residents are often low-income and disproportionately people of color. ""These regulations are long overdue, by almost a decade. I'm relieved and pleased that the EPA has finally issued proposed standards that are based on their own scientists' recommendations on an updated, higher cancer risk value. If enacted, these updated regulations would reduce emissions in fenceline communities,"" said Darya Minovi, a senior researcher scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""When the EPA issues the final rule, they should throw the net wider. The standard should cover a larger range of facilities to include off-site warehouses that often store recently sterilized equipment that continue to release ethylene oxide, but aren't regulated for their air emissions."" Minovi also said the EPA should require fenceline monitors -- devices that constantly read the air outside of facilities to make sure that toxic gas isn't drifting into neighborhoods. Jaime Rukstales, a member of the Illinois grassroots advocacy group Stop EtO in Lake County -- one of the communities impacted by ethylene oxide pollution -- says the EPA needs to impose tougher restrictions on ""all types of facilities that impact the health of our communities ... including sterilizers, manufacturers and warehouses near our homes, schools and businesses.""   Some off-site warehouses used to store newly sterilized products have registered high levels of ethylene oxide due to off-gassing of the products.   Meanwhile, chemical manufacturers sued the EPA in February over its updated hazard assessment for ethylene oxide. The industry wants the agency to use a less protective standard developed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. AdvaMed, a group that lobbies for the interests of medical device manufacturers, warned that more regulations could pose problems for patients. ""If new EPA regulations force sterilization facilities to close, patients could face treatment delays as sterile technology supplies, such as pacemakers and surgical equipment, fall short,"" Scott Whitaker, president and CEO of AdvaMed, said in a comment posted on the group's website. The EPA said some commercial sterilizers have already made the planned changes. ""Many sterilization and health care facilities are already taking the steps outlined in the proposal and have seen emissions drop significantly,"" McCabe said. Most facilities have taken action to control ethylene oxide blown out of sterilization chambers through exhaust vents known as ""back vents"" but only 25% to 33% of sterilizers are controlling so-called fugitive emissions, ethylene oxide that escapes or leaks into room air, said Jonathan Witt, an environmental engineer and technical lead on EPA's review of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. ""So we think it's a good sizable chunk of the industry, but still a little ways to go,"" Witt said on a call with reporters. If the rules go into effect, sterilizers would have 18 months to make the changes, which the EPA said is an accelerated time frame under the Clean Air Act. AdvaMed's Whitaker says that's not enough time. ""It could take many months for abatement equipment to arrive. Supply chains and manufacturing are still recovering from the pandemic,"" he noted in the statement. In issuing the proposed rules, the EPA said it aimed to strike a balance between lowing cancer risks for impacted communities and workers who use ethylene oxide while preserving ""critical sterilization capabilities."" The proposed rules would apply to 86 commercial sterilization facilities in the United States that use ethylene oxide gas to fumigate spices and medical devices.   The EPA says 20 billion medical devices -- mostly single-use, disposable items used in health care such as catheters, gloves and surgical gowns -- are sterilized using ethylene oxide. The US Food and Drug Administration is actively exploring alternatives to the use of the gas, the EPA said on Tuesday, but some devices still can't be sterilized any other way. In proposing the new rules, EPA said its new analysis found that exposure to ethylene oxide, or EtO, on the job significantly increased cancer risks for workers in sterilization facilities and those who apply ethylene oxide in health care facilities.   ""Now, a new EPA analysis shows that there may also be significant risks to workers who handle [ethylene oxide] and people who live, work or go to school near places where EtO is used in sterilization. And failing to take action to address these risks is simply unacceptable,"" EPA Administrator Janet McCabe said on a call with reporters. The additional lifetime cancer risk for a worker exposed to ethylene oxide for eight hours a day, 240 days a year for 35 years was between 1 in 10 and 1 in 36 for workers in sterilization facilities; and between 1 in 12 and 1 in 25 for workers exposed to ethylene oxide in health care facilities. To help lower those risks, the proposed rules require greater use of personal protective equipment for workers and new controls to decrease the amount of ethylene oxide in indoor air. Whitaker from AdvaMed, the medical device industry group, said the cancer risk for employees exposed to ethylene oxide on the job is overstated and disregards ""the strong employee protections already in practice."" Companies will also be required to use new real-time monitoring methods to confirm that these pollution controls are working inside facilities. These controls can measure ethylene oxide in indoor air down to 10 parts per billion.  If ethylene oxide levels climb above this threshold, everyone in the workplace would be required to wear protective equipment. They will also lower the amount of ethylene oxide that can be used for each sterilization cycle. The EPA is proposing to limit the application rate for ethylene oxide to no more than 500 milligrams per liter of air.   The rules would eliminate some niche uses of ethylene oxide where alternatives exist, including its use in museums, archival settings, beekeeping, some cosmetics, and in musical instruments. The EPA will take public comment on the new rules for 60 days. The agency will also host a virtual public webinar on May 1 to discuss its proposed rules and new risk assessment.

                      Clinics and doctors brace for more restrictions on women's health care after court ruling on abortion drug
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/10/health/mifepristone-clinics-doctors/index.html,"
                      Apr 11, 2023
                    ","
                      Less than a year after the US Supreme Court ended legal protection for abortions nationwide, clinics that provide reproductive health care across the United States are bracing for more restrictions on the care they provide to women. If a judge's ruling takes effect Friday, it may soon be illegal for doctors to prescribe mifepristone, the first in a two-drug regimen that can help women terminate a pregnancy at home -- and that has other uses. At Northeast Ohio Women's Center, staffers are calling patients who expected to get medication abortions next week, telling them to change their plans. ""They're scrambling to change their schedules to get in to see us earlier,"" said Dr. David Burkons, the physician who runs the clinics. About half of abortions in the US use mifepristone, which is sold under the brand name Mifeprex. Mifeprex blocks the hormone progesterone, which effectively stops a pregnancy from continuing. For an abortion, women take mifepristone first, followed one or two days later by misoprostol, a drug that causes the uterus to contract, cramp and bleed, similar to a heavy period. It empties out the uterus, ending the pregnancy. It can be used up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. But the uses of mifepristone go beyond abortion. The drug helps soften and open the cervix, the neck of the uterus, and doctors depend on it to help when women are having a miscarriage and when a pregnancy needs to be terminated quickly if the life of the mother is at stake. In certain situations, when a pregnancy has become too risky, time is of the essence, says Dr. Alison Edelman, who directs the division of Complex Family Planning at Oregon Health and Sciences University. ""The more expediently that we can have somebody not be pregnant, the better, and mifepristone helps us speed that process up and make it safer for patients,"" she said. Doctors also use mifepristone before procedures in which they need to go into the uterus, such as to remove bleeding polyps.  Studies have shown that the drug helps reduce the amount of force needed to open the cervix and reduces the amount of blood loss associated with the procedure. Studies also show that mifepristone has moderate to strong benefits for inducing labor and treating uterine fibroids and endometriosis, sometimes helping avoid surgery, according to the American Society of Health Systems Pharmacists.  It can be used to prevent bleeding between periods and to control hyperstimulation of the ovaries during in-vitro fertilization, the society said in a statement. Doctors say they still have other ways to treat those problems, but when considering the needs of individual patients, they will be missing a valuable tool. ""We have our gold standard of what we provide -- the safest, most effective regimen -- and then if it's not available, we use the next best one. And that's what we would be left with,"" Edelman said. Mifepristone has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for 23 years, and it has been used by over 5 million women in the United States. FDA data shows that less than 1% of women who take it have significant adverse events. A CNN analysis of FDA data found that mifepristone was even less risky than some other common medications, including Viagra and penicillin. Medication abortions have become an increasingly important option for women in states that restricted abortion access after the Supreme Court's ruling last year that ended legal protections for abortions in every state. They are also sometimes the only kind of abortion many women can get in rural areas that have lost abortion providers. This ease of access has also made the medication regimen a target for abortion opponents. ""They want to see a national ban, and this is in fact what they are going for in this case,"" said Kristen Moore, director of the EMAA Project, a nonprofit that is seeking to make it easier to get abortion medications in the US. What will happen next is far from settled. Appeals have been filed to stop the ruling in Texas from taking hold, and higher courts will have to weigh in. Even if the court does take mifepristone off the market in the US, doctors say, they will still be able to provide medication abortions using misoprostol alone. In fact, some abortion providers have been planning on using misoprostol by itself in case mifepristone is isn't available. Carafem, which provides telehealth abortion care, has been offering a misoprostol-only regimen since the Covid-19 pandemic began, Chief Operating Officer Melissa Grant says. ""In 2020, we started to use misoprostol alone as an option,"" she said. Workers have since been tweaking the regimen and gathering data. ""We now feel confident that, even though we would much prefer to use both, that we can use misoprostol alone effectively and are ready to switch gears to have a higher percentage of our clients or even 100% of our colleagues use that option if necessary,"" Grant said. Still, some providers said it's not ideal. The misoprostol-only regimen is slightly less effective than the one that uses both drugs, and it causes more cramping and bleeding, which can mean more complications. ""We're more likely to see failures and therefore more likely to need surgical intervention after misoprostol alone,"" said Dr. Erika Werner, chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts Medical Center. Still, doctors want women to know that medication abortions and miscarriage care will still be available even if mifepristone isn't.  And they hope that higher courts will intervene to keep this medication on pharmacy shelves. ""The clinicians would have to use these other options instead of choosing based on their own expertise, knowledge and judgment when rendering such care,"" Dr. Iffath Hoskins, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said Monday. ""Frankly, as a clinician, I do not want to be in that position.""

                      Sexually transmitted infections jumped by 7% in 2021, according to the CDC

                      More than 2.5 million cases of sexually transmitted infections were reported in 2021, jumping by 7% in one year, according to new data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""The US STI epidemic shows no signs of slowing,"" said Dr. Leandro Mena, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention.  Chlamydia accounted for more than half of the reported cases, with rates increasing about 4% in 2021. Cases of gonorrhea rose nearly 5%. Cases of syphilis surged 32% in one year, including an alarming rise in infections passed from pregnant mothers to babies developing in the womb. In 2021, congenital syphilis caused 220 stillbirths and infant deaths.  ""The most important thing to remember is that congenital syphilis is 100% preventable,"" Mena said. ""In many ways, it is the result of our failure to prevent syphilis among women of reproductive age and their partners."" Lacking prenatal care and adequate maternal treatment are among the most common missed opportunities for preventing congenital syphilis, he said.  But a recent report found that it's become harder for women to access reproductive health care services — such as routine screenings and birth control — in recent years. Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access — and more of them — in 2021 than they were in 2017.  A combination of factors has contributed to the overall rise in STI cases, and the pandemic exacerbated many of them, Mena said.  ""The lack of access to health care, including testing and treatment for STI, can make it difficult for people to receive the care they need,"" Mena said. ""Decreased funding for public health and an eroding infrastructure in public health really have limited access to testing driven services."" Persistent stigma associated with STIs and lingering effects of pandemic-related disruptions challenge the scope of screening services. The number of reported STIs is likely a vast underrepresentation of a ""staggering"" number of actual cases, he says.   STIs affect every population, but the 2021 data from the CDC shows that case rates are disproportionately high among gay and bisexual men, younger people, and Black and American Indian people.   ""To make progress towards ending this STI epidemic, we must really meet people where they are by developing tailored and localized interventions to have the greatest impact,"" Mena said. ""We want to make sure that we're addressing the social and economic conditions that make it more difficult for some of these populations to stay healthy.""

                      Weight loss may mean a risk of death for older adults, study shows

                      As much as people may celebrate their own weight loss, it is not always healthy. A new study shows that weight loss in older adults is associated with early death and life-limiting conditions.  Weight gain, on the other hand, was not associated with mortality, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Network Open.  Medical professionals have known to be concerned when older people with health conditions lose weight but researchers have not fully understood the impact of weight change on healthy older adults, according to lead study author Dr. Monira Hussain, a clinical epidemiologist and senior research fellow in public health and preventative medicine at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. The study looked at nearly 17,000 adults at least 70 years old in Australia and more than 2,000 adults in the United States who were at least 65 years old. Everyone who participated in the study was weighed at their annual checkup between 2010 and 2014, according to the study.  ""Our study found that even a 5% weight loss increases mortality risk, particularly in older men,"" Hussain said.  Weight gain in healthy older people, on the other hand, showed no association, she added. The association was found across starting weights, meaning people who are medically classified as obese also were at an increased risk when losing weight, said Perri Halperin, the clinical nutrition director for the Mount Sinai Health System. Halperin was not involved in the study. Other health issues The study was able to account for health issues at the start. It excluded people who had conditions like cardiovascular disease, dementia, physical disabilities or chronic illness, Hussain said.  ""It also excluded those with recent hospitalizations, which is important because hospitalization is often followed by weight loss due to acute conditions,"" Halperin said in an email.  But the study wasn't able to distinguish if people involved lost weight intentionally or unintentionally, Hussain added.  ""No questions were asked about changes in activity level and diet quality between the baseline study visit and subsequent study visits, so we do not have any information on how those factors may have impacted the results,"" Haperin said.  Why weight loss can be a risk Weight loss may be a risk factor for mortality because it can signal underlying issues. Weight loss may be a warning sign for conditions like cancer and dementia, and it is ""often linked to reduced appetite influenced by inflammation and hormones,"" Hussain said.  Underlying chronic health conditions can also trigger weight loss in older adults by impacting appetite, metabolism and eating habits, Halperin said. Mobility issues and medication side effects can also affect weight. Changes in weight can also signal concerns in lifestyle, Halperin said.  ""A major contributing factor to weight loss in older adults is social isolation. Other concerns include financial constraints and pain and discomfort,"" she added. In studies like these, remembering that correlation is not causation is important, Halperin said. Weight loss was associated with mortality, which means it's correlated -- but that doesn't mean the weight loss caused a person's death. ""It's also important to say that the opposite cannot be extrapolated nor recommended -- ie gaining weight would not necessarily decrease your mortality risk,"" she said in an email. ""As always, discuss your weight changes with your doctor or other medical professional."" The takeaway is for older adults to monitor their weight change, Halperin said. ""If they notice a decrease in the number on the scale (weight loss) or perhaps pants that were once snug fitting looser (decreased waist circumference),"" she added, ""bring it up with their doctor for possible further screening or testing."" But the advice also goes for the medical community, she said. Doctors and health care providers need to know that changes in weight require further investigation.

                      Suspension of mifepristone approval wouldn't be the end of medication abortion

                      Even if US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's decision to suspend the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone goes through, there still will be a nonsurgical option for people to manage abortions at home.  In the United States, the so-called abortion pill is actually two medications, mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym, or known as RU-486, and misoprostol, which is taken about 24 to 48 hours later.  The federal judge's ruling in Texas last week applies only to mifepristone. He delayed his ruling for a week to allow for appeals, but even if the ruling is put in place, it does not involve misoprostol.  Misoprostol alone is considered a safe and effective way to have an abortion, studies show. It has been used that way for decades. The two drugs work differently. Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus, and without it, the uterus will expel its contents. Misoprostol is approved by the FDA to prevent and treat gastric ulcers caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). It also is used off-label for other kinds of ulcers, and it has several gynecological uses, including to induce contractions, to decrease blood loss after delivery and to treat miscarriages.  When used for an abortion, misoprostol works to help empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions. ""It's a little old-school, but we could do it,"" said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in New Jersey and a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  It's what people did before the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, Brandi said. ""Many places around the country that don't have access to mifepristone, often due to politics, have been using misoprostol-only regimens for a long time,"" she said. California said Monday that it is stockpiling misoprostol. ""While California still believes Mifepristone is central to the preferred regimen for medication abortion, the State negotiated and purchased an emergency stockpile of Misoprostol in anticipation of Friday's ruling by far-right federal judge Matthew Kacsmaryk to ensure that California remains a safe haven for safe, affordable, and accessible reproductive care,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a release.  Some health organizations such as Carafem, a national provider of reproductive health services, offer the one drug alone. It is endorsed as a medically acceptable approach by the World Health Organization. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says a misoprostol-only regimen is an ""acceptable alternative"" if mifepristone is unavailable. Misoprostol is safe and effective The two-drug approach to medicine abortion is preferable because it is slightly more effective, Brandi said. Also, abortion with misoprostol alone can come with more side effects. A person who uses this method is instructed to use it sublingually, putting four pills under their tongue and leaving them there for 30 minutes, then swallowing what's left with water. They can also be used vaginally.  Typically, bleeding will begin within one to four hours after the first dose. Heavy bleeding usually lasts about three to five hours, but bleeding can last two weeks or longer, studies show.  Without mifepristone, a person most likely has to take more misoprostol than they would with the two-drug regimen. One study suggested that a person should be prescribed three or four doses as well as an additional dose in case it is needed. ""The more we give, the more side effects people will have. And that's not the goal. We want to make sure people not only have an effective response to the medicine, we also want to make sure that people aren't as uncomfortable as they could be,"" Brandi said. ""Like I tell my patients, you do not need to suffer to have an abortion. That is not the purpose of this process.""  Other side effects can include fever, chills, nausea and diarrhea.  Medication abortion now accounts for more than half of all US abortions, studies show. Even if mifepristone is no longer available and misoprostol becomes the only option, it will still be the most popular choice, according to Dr. Jamila Perritt, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in Washington, D.C.  ""Again, it is safe. It is effective. It requires a different dosing, and you experience the symptoms a little bit longer,"" Perritt said. ""There are some other some additional side effects, like a longer duration of bleeding or more intense nausea or vomiting or gastrointestinal side effects, but when you look at that against the barriers that are put in place, both at the state and now the federal level for accessing abortion, many individuals still choose the second medication alone, because it is more convenient and easier, and it means you're not walking through hundreds of protesters when you go to get care at your health care provider's office."" Dr. Iffath A. Hoskins, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, says that although the one-drug option is safe, people shouldn't have to make that choice because a lot of research shows that the two drugs in combination are highly safe and effective. ""We do use off label medications when clinically appropriate; however, that should not happen here because we have over two decades worth of clinically sound evidence based information that this is valid option,"" Hoskins said.

                      Gun violence has affected most families in the US, new survey finds

                      Worry and fear about gun violence are widespread in the United States, where most families have been affected by a gun-related incident, according to a new survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation.   Nearly 1 in 5 adults has had a family member killed by a gun, including in homicide and suicide. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey found.  The new report comes less than a day after a shooting that claimed at least four lives in Louisville, Kentucky. Mass shootings have escalated in recent years, reaching a record pace in 2023. There have been at least 146 incidents so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving more than 200 people dead and hundreds more injured.  About half of all gun-related deaths are suicides, federal data shows. And the suicide rate has also recently increased, reversing years of decline and returning to near-record levels.  These tragic trends are part of a gun epidemic that has become deadlier than ever in the US. There were nearly 49,000 gun-related deaths in 2021, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- an unprecedented surge of about 23% over two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. The vast majority of adults say they worry at least sometimes that they or someone in their family will become a victim of gun violence, the new KFF survey found. Nearly a quarter of parents of children younger than 18 say they worry about it daily or almost daily.  Guns are now the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US, surpassing car accidents in 2020. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to another recent KFF analysis. There are vast disparities in who's dying from guns, too. A recent study found that the homicide rate among young Black men was nearly 10 times higher than the overall firearm death rate in the US in 2021.  According to the new KFF survey, Black adults are more than twice as likely as White adults to have lost a loved one to gun violence and to have personally witnessed someone being shot.  The weight of that disparity is felt heavily in the Black community. One in 6 Black adults say that they don't feel at all safe in their neighborhoods, far higher than the share of White or Hispanic adults, according to the new KFF survey. About a third of both Black and Hispanic adults say they worry daily or almost daily that a family member will become a victim of gun violence, and about 1 in 5 say that gun-related crimes, injuries and deaths are a constant threat to their local community.  Still, prevention measures are lacking.  About three-quarters of adults who have a gun in their home say it is stored in a way that bucks common gun-safety practices, such as in an unlocked location or already loaded, the new survey found. And only 5% of adults say that a health care professional has talked to them about gun safety.  The latest KFF survey is based on responses from a representative sample of about 1,300 adults that were collected in mid-March.

                      Ninety-three confirmed or probable cases of blastomycosis have been identified in Michigan's Delta and Menominee counties, according to the local health department, and they are believed to be associated with a paper mill in the town of Escanaba. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is predominantly found in the Midwest and the South, particularly around the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and the Great Lakes. There are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, according to the CDC. One analysis found 1,216 deaths related to the illness from 1990 to 2010. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won't get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Other symptoms may include chest pain, trouble breathing, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and muscle or joint pain, according to Public Health Delta & Menominee Counties. In rare cases, the infection can spread outside the lungs to places like the skin, bones, brain and spinal cord. Blastomycosis does not spread from person to person. It's treated with antifungal medication that must be taken for a period ranging from six months to a year, depending on the severity of the illness and the person's overall health.   Nineteen of the cases linked with Escanaba Billerud Paper Mill have been confirmed by culture or microscope, and the other 74 are probable, meaning the person has symptoms of blastomycosis and a positive antigen or antibody test, the health department says. ""Although the source of the infection has not been established, we continue to take this matter very seriously and are following recommendations from health and government officials and implementing numerous, proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and visitors,"" Billerud Escanaba Mill Operations Vice President Brian Peterson said in a statement from the health department.

                      As abortion rights become more restricted in the United States, a new study shows that it's become harder for women to access reproductive health care services more broadly -- such as routine screenings and birth control -- in recent years. Women seeking reproductive health care were more likely to report challenges to access -- and more of them -- in 2021 than they were in 2017, according to the study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open. Researchers analyzed survey data from thousands of women who were asked to reflect on their experiences with reproductive health care in the three years leading up to the study. About 45% of women experienced at least one barrier to reproductive health care services in 2021, up 10% from 2017. Nearly 19% reported at least three barriers in 2021, up from 16% in 2017.  ""Reproductive health care services are among the most common health care needs of women of reproductive age, and access to such care is of paramount public health importance,"" the researchers wrote. Delaying or forgoing it can have serious consequences, both to an individual's physical health and to their general well-being.  The most commonly cited barrier in both years was finding a physician or clinic that felt comfortable to the patient. About 1 in 4 women identified this as a challenge in 2021, up from about 1 in 5 in 2017.  Cost became slightly less of a barrier in that timeframe, but interpersonal relationships and logistical challenges such as finding transportation or child care became more challenging.  The Covid-19 pandemic probably contributed to these shifts, according to the researchers. Fear of contracting the virus could have heightened anxieties around visiting a health care setting, for example. The child care crisis has been exacerbated in recent years, which could limit travel flexibilities. On the other hand, stimulus checks may have helped ease some financial barriers.  Broader restrictions on reproductive rights -- including a significant cut in federally funded family planning clinics by the Trump administration -- probably also played a role, they wrote.  The largest increases in barriers to reproductive health care were reported by individuals from historically disadvantaged populations, including low-income and Hispanic women.  Access to reproductive health care is a ""persistent and pressing barrier,"" the researchers wrote. ""Significant"" challenges that existed in 2017 generally got worse in 2021.  ""The study's findings suggest that efforts are needed to ensure reproductive health care access, especially during disruptive events,"" they wrote.

                      Project that gave $500 a month to some California residents shows that such efforts could have a 'profound impact on public health, researchers say

                      Results are out from a two-year experiment testing the effects of guaranteed income on residents of Stockton, California -- but the findings were complicated by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, researchers say.  The program, dubbed the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration or SEED, gave monthly payments of $500 to 131 people starting in February 2019. There was also a control group of 200 Stockton residents.  A little over a year later, the Covid-19 pandemic began, launching a domino effect of lifestyle changes as more people stayed home under lockdown orders. Researchers Dr. Amy Castro and Dr. Stacia West, from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Tennessee, found that people who received the money were more likely to be able to handle a $400 emergency, according to the analysis, published Monday in the Journal of Urban Health.  The extra $500 a month also ""permitted judiciousness about COVID and what conditions workers would tolerate for poorly compensated work,"" the study says.   But the virus wasn't the only public health emergency the Stockton residents faced: The researchers also examined the impact of the record wildfires that scorched Northern California in 2020. According to Castro, the wildfires and the pandemic ""trapped"" people between ""competing public health orders,"" especially for those with pre-existing health conditions. People were supposed to interact outdoors because of the coronavirus, for example, but the wildfires drove them back inside. ""The $500 buffered against some of these stressors by providing people the ability to stock up on household goods and procure what they needed to weather covid and wildfire season,"" Castro wrote in an email to CNN. One survey respondent described how he chose to use food delivery apps because wildfire smoke made it difficult to breathe outdoors but going to the grocery store seemed risky because of Covid-19.  ""In this case, his pre-existing health condition was forcing him to pit the need for air against the need for groceries,"" meaning ""he often resorts to expensive food delivery apps which eroded his finances further,"" the researchers wrote.  Overall, the researchers said, their findings appear to show ""that guaranteed income, under normative economic and health conditions, does calm income volatility and allay financial emotional and psychological distress"" and could have a ""profound"" impact on public health.  ""We never could have predicted the ways that the concept of unconditional cash has spread around the country and across both sides of the political aisle with serious public investment in the concept of unconditional cash. When we launched SEED we assumed it would be several years before anyone would replicate it.  Instead, the pandemic lead to an explosion in guaranteed income programs across the entire United States including some unexpected places like upstate New York, Iowa, Ohio, South Carolina, and Florida,"" West wrote in an email to CNN. Guaranteed income pilot programs are underway in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois; and Los Angeles. Although the analysis was limited because people left work for a variety of reasons during the pandemic and the data is limited to people in Stockton, making it difficult to generalize further, the researchers found that overall, the extra $500 a month did not disincentivize people from working. ""The effect of guaranteed income on work was not statistically detectable, meaning that members in both groups maintained their work obligations at equal rates,"" West explained.   Guaranteed income, also known as universal basic income, means giving money to everyone, regardless of how much they earn, so they can have more freedom to move between jobs, train for new positions, provide care or engage in creative pursuits. Interest in the concept has risen in recent years, driven by concerns that automation and the climate crisis would lead to a mass displacement of workers. This study also showed that the ""length of time someone receives unconditional cash matters,"" Castro said. ""We did not start seeing changes in people's health and well-being until 6 months after receiving consistent cash. Recurring cash over time impacts people differently than a short-term cash infusion like the [Earned Income Tax Credit]. This offers a clear signal back to the Federal government when we think about policies like the child tax credit,"" she wrote. A Pew Research Center poll from 2020 found that about 54% of American adults are against the idea of the federal government providing a guaranteed income of approximately $1,000 a month to all adults, regardless of their work status. More Democrats support the concept than Republicans.

                      Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and dozens of other biotech and pharmaceutical company leaders have signed an open letter in support of the US Food and Drug Administration's authority ""to approve and regulate safe, effective medicines for every American"" after Friday's decision by a Texas district court judge to halt the agency's approval of mifepristone, one of the medications used in abortion procedures.  US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said Friday that he will suspend the FDA's approval of mifepristone, the first of two drugs used in a medication abortion, after a weeklong stay to allow for appeals. On Monday, the US Department of Justice asked a federal appeals court to put a hold on the ruling. The letter called for a reversal of Kacsmaryk's decision, saying it ""set a precedent for diminishing FDA's authority over drug approvals, and in so doing, creates uncertainty for the entire biopharma industry."" ""As an industry we count on the FDA's autonomy and authority to bring new medicines to patients under a reliable regulatory process for drug evaluation and approval. Adding regulatory uncertainty to the already inherently risky work of discovering and developing new medicines will likely have the effect of reducing incentives for investment, endangering the innovation that characterizes our industry,"" the letter says. The letter also warns that if the judicial system ""can overturn drug approvals without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone.""   In a separate statement, the biotech industry group BIO's interim president and CEO, Rachel King, emphasized the ""dangerous precedent"" the Texas judge's decision sets. ""The preliminary ruling by a federal judge in Texas is an assault on science and the FDA's long-standing role as the authority to make decisions on the safety and efficacy of medicines. For a court to invalidate the approval of a drug that was reviewed and approved more than two decades ago is without precedent. As legal scholars have noted, the courts do not have the medical expertise to make these types of scientific determinations,"" King said.

                      Certain brands of fresh ready-to-eat salads that include chicken or ham may also contain lettuce contaminated with listeria, a potentially deadly bacteria, according to the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Revolution Farms of Caledonia, Michigan, voluntarily recalled lettuce produced and sold under the brand Revolution Farms on April 5, 2023, due to the potential for listeria contamination.  However, lettuce from that recall was used to create ready-to-eat salads under the brand names ""Fruit Ridge Farms"" and ""Bell's Bistro,"" according to a FSIS public health alert issued Monday.  The salads were shipped to retail locations in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. As yet, no confirmed reports of adverse reactions have been reported, however the FSIS is ""concerned some products may be in consumers' refrigerators,"" according to the alert.  ""Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,"" the alert advised. The potentially contaminated products are ""Fruit Ridge Farms White Chicken Caesar Salad""; ""Fruit Ridge Farms Chef Salad with Ham""; ""Bell's Bistro White Chicken Caesar Salad""; and ""Bell's Bistro Chef Salad with Ham."" Consumers can also identify the salads by looking for the numbers ""EST. 17050"" or ""P-17050,"" which should appear inside the USDA mark of inspection on the item, the alert said. Listeria is a hardy germ, so determined to stick around that it can continue to grow while refrigerated, which even its fellow foodborne bacterial threats salmonella and E. coli cannot do. Listeria contamination can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects pregnant people and newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. In the United States, listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness, killing about 260 people a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Even with adequate antibiotic treatment, the disease has a high mortality rate"" of 20% to 30%, the US Food and Drug Administration said. Pregnant people are about 10 times more likely to become sick from listeria, and the illness can be fatal to a fetus. Pregnant Hispanics are at highest risk, likely due to eating traditional soft cheeses such as queso fresco and other foods made with milk that is unpasteurized, the FDA said. Foods made with raw milk are 50 to 160 times more likely to contain listeria, the agency said. Adults and healthy children with listeria infections may simply develop a mild or unpleasant illness that will not require hospitalization or antibiotics. However, anyone immunocompromised — including older adults, organ transplant patients, and those with cancer, kidney disease, diabetes or HIV/AIDS — can become seriously ill and die.

                      For all the joy they bring, families and close friendships often involve conflict, betrayal, regret and resentment. Prince Harry's recent memoir, ""Spare,"" is a reminder of the fact that the people closest to us often have the greatest power to hurt us. He describes power struggles, conflict, challenging family dynamics and decades of guilt, jealousy and resentment. This sort of conflict can feel impossible to resolve. It's not easy to move past, and sometimes it simply isn't going to happen — at least in the short term. But psychology has helped us understand more about the breakdown of close relationships and what factors make resolution more likely. In the course of a lifetime, it is difficult to avoid hurting, upsetting or being in conflict with people we love. It is an inevitable part of most lives, and learning how to negotiate it is a more useful and realistic goal than avoiding it. The first step is understanding what makes relationship conflict so difficult and the different approaches people have to it. Canadian psychologists Judy Makinen and Susan Johnson have used the term attachment injuries to describe the sorts of wounds inflicted when we perceive that we have been abandoned, betrayed or mistreated by those closest to us. These wounds sting so sharply because they lead us to question the safety, dependability or allegiance of these people. They trigger a myriad of emotional and behavioral responses, including aggression, resentment, fear, avoidance and reluctance to forgive. These responses have evolved as self-protection and are rooted to our personal histories and personality. But the pain can linger indefinitely, continuing to influence us from the shadows. So what have psychologists learned about how people heal, move through the hurt and even learn and grow from it? READ MORE: 'Love languages' might help you understand your partner — but it's not exactly science Turtles, sharks, teddy bears, foxes and owls Much research has been carried out studying conflict resolution. Social psychologist David W. Johnson studied conflict management ""styles"" in humans and modeled the typical ways we respond to conflict. He argued that our responses and strategies in conflict resolution tend to involve an attempt to balance our own concerns (our goals) with the concerns of the other people involved (their goals and preservation of the relationship).  Johnson outlined five main styles or approaches to this balancing act. ""Turtles"" withdraw, abandoning both their own goals and the relationship. The result tends to be frozen, unresolved conflict. ""Sharks"" have an aggressive, forceful take and protect their own goals at all costs. They tend to attack, intimidate and overwhelm during conflict. ""Teddy bears"" seek to keep the peace and smooth things over. They drop their own goals completely. They sacrifice for the sake of the relationship. ""Foxes"" adopt a compromising style. They are concerned with sacrifices being made on both sides and see concession as the solution, even when it results in less-than-ideal outcomes for both sides. ""Owls"" adopt a style that views conflict as a problem to be resolved. They are open to solving it through whichever solutions offer both parties a pathway to achieve their goals and maintain the relationship. This can involve considerable time and effort. But owls are willing to endure the struggle. READ MORE: Moving in with your partner? Talking about these 3 things first can smooth the way, according to a couples therapist Research has suggested that our conflict resolution styles are related to our personalities and attachment histories. For example, people whose early attachment experiences taught them that their feelings are unimportant or invisible may be more likely to develop conflict management styles that instinctively minimize their needs (for example, the teddy bear). Some psychologists have also suggested that our conflict management styles can be modified in long-term relationships but do not tend to change dramatically. In other words, while a teddy bear may have the potential to develop conflict management characteristics that reflect other styles, they are highly unlikely to turn into a shark. Psychologists Richard Mackey, Matthew Diemer and Bernard O'Brien argued conflict is inevitable in all relationships. Their research found the duration of a relationship heavily depends upon how conflict is dealt with, and the longest-lasting, most fulfilling relationships are those in which conflict is accepted and constructively approached by both parties. So, while a relationship between two sharks might be enduring, the likelihood that it will be harmonious is significantly less compared with a relationship between two owls. READ MORE: Should I stay or should I go? Here are the factors people ponder when deciding to break up Forgiveness Forgiveness is often hailed as the ultimate goal in relationship conflict. Jungian analysts Lisa Marchiano, Joseph Lee and Deborah Stewart describe forgiveness as reaching a place where we are able to ""hold in our hearts at the same time, the magnitude of the injury that has been done to us and the humanity of the injurer."" That's not an easy place to reach because it can feel as though we are minimizing our suffering by forgiving someone. Psychologists Masi Noor and Marina Cantacuzino founded the Forgiveness Project, which provides resources to help people overcome unresolved grievances. They include a set of essential skills or tools that they argue can help us reach forgiveness. These include understanding that all humans are fallible (including ourselves), giving up competing over who has suffered more, finding empathy for how others see the world and acknowledging that other perspectives exist, and accepting responsibility for how we might have contributed to our own suffering, even if it's a bitter pill to swallow. As Mark Twain put it: ""Forgiveness is the fragrance that the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it."" READ MORE: Sex, love and companionship ... with AI?

                      Is your blood type A, B, a combination of the two, or something else? You don't know, you say? Many people are in the same boat. In fact, only 62% of Americans reported knowing their blood type, according to a 2020 CBS News poll.  Those letters (and pluses and minuses) can be crucial information in an emergency, and there are simple but accurate ways to find out. Most blood types are only compatible with a handful of others, according to Dr. Dayand Borge, Divisional Chief Medical Officer at the American Red Cross.  Accidental incompatible blood transfusions, while rare, can be dangerous, Borge said. Luckily, there are easy ways to find out your blood type.  Ask your parents or doctor Before you go out of your way to try any of the other methods, check with your parents first. They may know or have old health records that include your blood type. You can also reach out to your health care provider, who may have that information on file. Blood draw Next time you go in to get your blood drawn, ask to know your blood type. If you've had blood drawn in the past, you can call the lab to see if they have the information. To request a blood test, visit your healthcare provider or a local health clinic. At-home blood test You can also purchase an at-home blood test online and have it shipped to your door. The kit comes with a needle and a testing card to drop your blood on. For many at-home tests, results take only minutes. Blood donation When you donate blood, the blood goes through multiple tests, including blood type. After you've donated with the Red Cross, you're given a blood donor card which will give you access to your blood type when they test it. This takes a few days and is free. If you've donated in the past, you may be able to check your blood type on their website. Saliva test For those squeamish of needles, a saliva test can help you determine your blood type without having to draw blood.  About 80% of people secrete the same antigens that are in their blood in their saliva, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical & Diagnostic Research.  This means that the test is effective for most, but not everyone. These tests can be found online and cost more than traditional, at-home blood tests.

                      How safe is the abortion pill compared with other common drugs

                      A federal judge in Texas ruled on Friday to suspend the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, the first drug in the medication abortion process, nationwide by the end of this week.  The judge sided with the coalition of anti-abortion national medical associations that filed the lawsuit. He argued that the FDA failed to adequately consider risks associated with the drug, including ""the intense psychological trauma and post-traumatic stress women often experience from chemical abortion.""  However, data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone is even safer than some common, low-risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. There were five deaths associated with mifepristone use for every 1 million people in the US who have used the drug since its approval in 2000, according to the US Food and Drug Administration as of last summer. That's a death rate of 0.0005%. Comparatively, the risk of death by penicillin — a common antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia — is four times greater than it is for mifepristone, according to a study on life-threatening allergic reactions. Risk of death by taking Viagra — used to treat erectile dysfunction — is nearly 10 times greater, according to a study cited in the amicus brief filed by the FDA.  ""[Mifepristone] has been used for over 20 years by over five million people with the capacity to become pregnant,"" said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive science at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Its safety is very well established."" The Justice Department, the FDA, and Danco — a manufacturer of mifepristone that intervened in the case — have already appealed the ruling. Within hours of the decision in Texas, a federal judge in Washington state issued a conflicting ruling that the federal government must keep mifepristone available in the 17 Democrat-led states and the District of Columbia that had sued in a separate lawsuit. If the Texas ruling is allowed to take effect this week, 40 million more women of reproductive age would lose access to medication abortion care around the country, according to data from abortion rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America. That's in addition to the 24.5 million women of reproductive age living in states with abortion bans. ""The court's disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation,"" said Dr. Jack Resneck, Jr., president of the American Medical Association, in a statement. ""By rejecting medical facts, the court has intruded into the exam room and has intervened in decisions that belong to patients and physicians."" Weighing medication abortion against the alternatives Medication abortion has become the most common method for abortion, accounting for more than half of all US abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute.   The growing popularity of medication abortion is largely because of its accessibility, said Abigail Aiken, associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who leads a research group on medication abortion.  ""It reduces the cost, it reduces barriers where people may not want to go to a clinic,"" she said.  It is also a safer option than both procedural abortion or childbirth. The rate of major complications — like hemorrhages or infections — for medication abortions is about one-third of a percent, according to a 2015 study conducted by Upadhyay. That means out of more than 11,000 cases, 35 experienced any major complications. The likelihood of serious complications via procedural abortion — performed second-trimester or later — is slightly higher than medication abortion at 0.41%, according to the same study. And childbirth by far comes with the highest risk, at 1.3%. If access to mifepristone is cut off, abortion clinics and telehealth organizations could pivot to misoprostol-only abortions, Aiken told CNN. Although misoprostol-only abortions are used around the world, they are less effective, associated with a higher risk of serious complications and often more painful than the mifepristone and misoprostol combination, she said. In the latest study of self-managed misoprostol-only medication abortions in the US, Johnson found misoprostol-only abortions to be a safe alternative, though less safe than using both pills. The study, published in February, analyzed data from online telehealth medication abortion provider Aid Access from 2020. Nearly 90% of 568 users reported completed abortions and 2% experienced serious complications using only misoprostol.  Mifepristone and misoprostol together is still considered the gold standard, Aiken told CNN. People who used the two-pill combination were less likely to experience serious complications than those who went with the misoprostol-only regimen. ""It's clear people can use these medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, at home even without the help of a medical professional very safely,"" said Aiken. Because misoprostol is used to treat multiple ailments including stomach ulcers, it's readily stocked in pharmacies and unlikely to be taken off the market anytime soon, Johnson told CNN.  However, a lesser-effective method means more people will likely have unsuccessful abortions. ""It's possible that it might not work for some people, and it will prolong their abortions,"" said Upadhyay. ""Then by the time they get back to the clinic, they're seeking abortion later in pregnancy."" Before the ruling, 19 states already restricted telehealth abortion care, limiting access to medication abortion. Nearly half of US adults were unsure whether medication abortion was currently legal in their state as of late-January, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Experts say that confusion will only be exacerbated. ""People are not going to be sure mifepristone or misoprostol in fact, is available. I think it's going to be confusing,"" said Aiken. ""As people look around for options or feel unsure about their options, they may end up delaying [care].""

                      Why you keep having the same dream

                      For years, dreams of my teeth cracking, loosening or falling out plagued my sleep. Loved ones of mine have repeatedly dreamed of flying, rolling away in a self-operating car, or running late for school or work. These aren't typical nightmares, which usually happen once. They're some of the most common recurring dreams, which tend to lean negative and can take some work to overcome.  ""Recurring dreams are likelier to be about very profound life experiences or just very character logic issues that are kind of guaranteed to recur in waking life because they're part of you rather than a one-time event,"" said dream researcher Deirdre Barrett, a lecturer of psychology in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.  Since our dreams typically don't repeat themselves, all it takes is dreaming the same dream twice or more for it to be considered recurring, Barrett said. They're more common in childhood, Barrett said, but can last into adulthood. And recurring dreams don't always happen in close proximity to each other — they can pop up multiple times per month or years apart, Barrett said.  Recurring dreams might be the same every time, or they might just recycle the same types of scenarios or worries, experts said.  ""It is difficult to assess the prevalence of recurrent dreams because it is not something that happens on a regular basis for most people,"" said clinical psychologist Dr. Nirit Soffer-Dudek, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, via email. ""And when people are asked about past dreams in their life, they may be influenced by memory distortions, interest in dreams (or lack thereof), or other factors.""  Regardless, anything that comes up repeatedly is worth investigating, said sleep medicine specialist Dr. Alex Dimitriu, founder of Silicon Psych, a psychiatry and sleep medicine practice in Menlo Park, California.  ""People have this kind of touch-and-go approach with things that are uncomfortable or fear-inducing, and I think dreams are, in some way, the same way,"" Dimitriu said. ""As a psychiatrist, I'm inclined to say that there is some message that might be trying to be conveyed to you. And the answer, then, might be to figure out what that is. And I think when you do, you might be able to put the thing to rest.""  Here's how to figure out what's triggering your recurring dreams.  What's in a dream?  For some recurring dreams, the message is straightforward — if you repeatedly dream about running late for school or work, you're probably just often nervous about being unprepared for those things. But others, despite their commonness, might not have a universal meaning, requiring you do some soul-searching to learn more.  ""In interpretation, we really don't believe there are universal symbols, but that (it's) what an individual's own sort of personal symbol system is and their associations to something are,"" Barrett said.  In addition to unpreparedness, other common themes of recurring dreams include social embarrassment, feeling inadequate compared with others, and danger in the form of car crashes or natural disasters, Barrett and Dimitriu said.  Some people have dreams revolving around test anxiety even if they haven't been in school in years, Barrett said. This can reflect a general fear of failure or a sense of being judged by authority figures. Dreams of tooth loss or damage might have to do with loss of something else in your life, feelings of hopelessness or defenselessness, or health concerns.  When faced with a recurring dream, ask yourself what the message could be, Dimitriu said. What is your relationship to the things or people in the dream? What are your fears and belief systems about those things? What are the top five things in your life that might be triggering it or related to it? What are you really worried about?  ""I definitely think it's fine to do informal dream interpretation, either on your own or with a close, trusted person who may just sort of see things to question in it that you don't,"" Barrett said.  People with post-traumatic stress disorder or anxiety are more likely to have recurring dreams, especially ones with anxious natures, Dimitriu said. A PTSD dream stems from a trauma so severe it keeps returning as a nightmare.  ""The brain is trying to resolve something and lay it to rest,"" he added. But ""in people with PTSD, their dreams are so vivid that they wake them up from sleep. And that becomes the problem because the dream never gets processed. ... And that's why it recurs — it's unfinished work.""  Sometimes recurring dreams can point to biological sources, too. ""People with sleep apnea will report dreams of, like, drowning, suffocating, giant waves, gasping for air, being underwater or being choked,"" Dimitriu said, when they're actually experiencing breathing interruptions because of their condition.   There can be environmental triggers as well, such as a car alarm down the street or a dripping faucet, he added, which can set off dreams with imagery of those things. How to cope  Once you have a better sense of what your worries are, writing about them before bed can be helpful for alleviating negative recurring dreams and stress in general.  ""For my patients and myself, journaling is such a powerful tool,"" Dimitriu said. Meditating could also help.  When you know what fear is behind your dream, Dimitriu recommended processing it via a three-column method used in cognitive behavioral therapy: What is your automatic thought? What's your automatic feeling? Lastly, what's the more reality-based alternative thought?  Dream rehearsal therapy, also known as imagery rehearsal therapy, can be effective for both recurring dreams and nightmares. This approach involves writing down in detail the narrative elements of the dream, then rewriting it so it ends positively. Right before falling asleep, you'd set the intention to re-dream by saying aloud, ""If or when I have the beginnings of the same bad dream, I will be able to instead have this much better dream with a positive outcome.""  If your recurring dreams are making you stressed or unhappy, causing other symptoms, or starting to impair your ability to function on a regular basis, it's time to seek professional help, experts said.  There could be another reason Recurring dreams could also stem from poor sleep hygiene, Soffer-Dudek said.  ""A lot of awkward things happen in the night when people are sleep deprived, drink caffeine too late, drink alcohol too late, worked too late or slept four hours last night because they stayed up too late,"" he said. ""The fundamental core and foundation of healthy dream life starts with healthy sleep.""  Dimitriu also recommended limiting distractions that interfere with your time to reflect and process, such as spending unnecessary time on your phone or always filling the silence.  When your mind is always occupied, ""what happens is all that processing has to happen somewhere,"" he said. ""So now there's more pressure for that to happen in your dream life.""

                      Maternity units are closing across America, forcing expectant mothers to hit the road
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/07/health/maternity-units-closing/index.html,"

                      In picturesque Bonner County, Idaho, Leandra Wright, 40, is pregnant with her seventh child.    Wright is due in August, but three weeks ago, the hospital where she had planned to deliver, Bonner General Health, announced that it would be suspending its labor and delivery services in May.    Now, she's facing a potentially precarious drive to another hospital 45 minutes from her home.    ""It's frustrating and worrisome,"" Wright said.   Wright has a history of fast labors. Her 15-year-old son, Noah, was born on the way to the hospital.  ""My fifth child was born on the side of the highway,"" Wright said. ""It was wintertime, and my hospital at the time in California was about 40 minutes away, and the roads were icy, so we didn't make it in time.""   By the time she and Noah got to the hospital, about 15 minutes after he was born, his body temperature was lower than normal.  ""It worries me not to have a doctor there and worries me to have to go through that,"" Wright said.  Residents of Bonner County aren't the only ones dealing with unexpected maternity unit closures.   Since 2011, 217 hospitals in the United States have closed their labor and delivery departments, according to a report by the health care consulting firm Chartis. A CNN tally shows that at least 13 such closures have been announced in the past year alone.   Closures nationwide Services provided at maternity units vary from hospital to hospital. Most  offer obstetrics care in which an obstetrician will deliver a baby, either vaginally or via cesarean section. These units also provide perinatal care, which is medical and supportive care before and after delivery.  Other services provided may include lactation specialists and private delivery rooms.  After May 19, Bonner General Health will no longer offer obstetrical services, meaning there will be zero obstetricians practicing there. Consequently, the hospital will no longer deliver babies. Additionally, the unit will no longer provide 24-hour anesthesia support or post-resuscitation or pre-transportation stabilization care for critically ill newborns.  Some hospitals that have recently closed their maternity units still offer perinatal care, along with routine gynecological care.  Bonner General is planning to establish a clinic where perinatal care will be offered. Gynecological services -- such as surgical services, preventative care, wellness exams and family planning -- will still be provided at a nearby women's health clinic.  The Chartis report says that the states with the highest loss of access to obstetrical care are Minnesota, Texas, Iowa, Kansas and Wisconsin, with each losing more than 10 facilities.  Data released last fall by the infant and maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes also shows that more than 2.2 million women of childbearing age across 1,119 US counties are living in ""maternity care deserts,"" meaning their counties have no hospitals offering obstetric care, no birth centers and no obstetric providers.   Maternity care deserts have been linked to a lack of adequate prenatal care or treatment for pregnancy complications and even an increased risk of maternal death for a year after giving birth.  Money is one reason why maternity units are being shuttered.   According to the American Hospital Association, 42% of births in the US are paid for by Medicaid, which has low reimbursement rates. Employer-sponsored insurance pays about $15,000 for a delivery, and Medicaid pays about $6,500, according to the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that analyzes health care cost and utilization data.  ""Medicaid funds about half of all births nationally and more than half of births in rural areas,"" said Dr. Katy Kozhimannil, a public health researcher at the University of Minnesota who has conducted research on the growing number of maternity care deserts.  Kozhimannil says communities that are most likely to be affected by maternity unit closures tend to be remote towns in rural counties in states with ""less generous Medicaid programs.""  Hospitals in larger cities are often able to offset low reimbursement rates from Medicaid births with births covered by employer-sponsored insurance, according to Dr. Sina Haeri, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and CEO of Ouma Health, a company that provides virtual prenatal and perinatal care to mothers living in maternity care deserts.   Many large hospitals also have neonatal intensive care units.   ""If you have a NICU, that's a substantial revenue generator for a hospital,"" Haeri said.   Most rural hospitals do not have a NICU, only a nursery where they care for full-term, healthy babies, he said. Due to that financial burden, it does not make financial sense for many rural hospitals to keep labor and delivery units open.   A low volume of births is another reason for the closures.   In announcing the closure, Bonner General noted that in 2022, it delivered just 265 babies, which the hospital characterized as a significant decrease.   Rural hospital administrators providing obstetric care say it takes at least 200 births annually for a unit to remain safe and financially viable, according to a study led by Kozhimannil for the University of Minnesota's Rural Health Research Center.   Many administrators surveyed said they are working to keep units open despite low birth rates.   ""Of all the folks that we surveyed, about a third of them were still operating, even though they had fewer than 200 births a year,"" Kozhimannil said. ""We asked why, and they said, 'because our community needs it.' ""     Another issue for hospital administrators is staffing and recruitment.     The decision to close Bonner General's labor and delivery unit was also directly affected by a lack of experienced, qualified doctors and nurses in the state, said Erin Binnall, a Bonner General Health spokesperson.   ""After May 19th, Bonner General Health will no longer have reliable, consistent pediatric coverage to manage neonatal resuscitations and perinatal care. Bonner General's number one priority is patient safety. Not having board-certified providers certified in neonatal resuscitation willing to provide call and be present during deliveries makes it unsafe and unethical for BGH to provide these services,"" Binnall told CNN by email.   The American Hospital Association acknowledges the staffing challenges some hospitals face.    ""Simply put, if a hospital cannot recruit and retain the providers, nurses, and other appropriately trained caregivers to sustainably support a service then it cannot provide that care,"" the association said in a statement. ""Such challenges are only magnified in rural America, where workforce strain is compounded by aging demographics that in some communities has dramatically decreased demand for services like Labor and Delivery.""  More stringent abortion laws may be playing a role in the closures, too.   Bonner General said in a news release last month that due to Idaho's ""legal and political climate, highly respected, talented physicians are leaving. In addition, the Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care.""   According to the Guttmacher Institute, Idaho has one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country: a complete ban that has only a few exceptions.   Idaho requires an ""affirmative defense,"" Guttmacher says, meaning a provider ""has to prove in court that an abortion met the criteria for a legal exception.""  No matter the reason, Kozhimannil said, closures in rural communities aren't just a nuisance. They also put families at risk.   ""That long drive isn't just an inconvenience. It actually is associated with health risks,"" she said. ""The consequence that we saw is an increase in preterm births. Preterm birth is the largest risk factor for infant mortality. It is a huge risk factor for developmental and cognitive delays for kids.""   Haeri says the decline in maternal care also has a clear effect on maternal mortality rates.   The maternal death rate for 2021 -- the year for which the most recent data is available -- was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in the US, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020, according to a report from the National Center for Health Statistics. In raw numbers, 1,205 women died of maternal causes in the US in 2021.   Conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes may raise a person's risk of complications, as can being pregnant with multiples, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pregnant women over the age of 35 are at a higher risk of pre-eclampsia.  Searching for solutions   As labor and delivery units continue to shut their doors, possible solutions to the growing problem are complex, Haeri says.   ""I think anyone that comes to you and says the current system is working is lying to you,"" he said. ""We all know that the current maternity system is not good.""    Kozhimannil's research has found that many women who live in maternity care deserts are members of minority communities.   ""When we conducted that research, we found the communities that were raising the alarm about this ... tended to be Black and indigenous, or tribal communities in rural places,"" she said. ""Black communities in the South and East and tribal communities throughout the country, but especially in the West, Mountain West and Midwest.""   Haeri says one possible solution is at a woman's fingertips.    ""I always say if a woman's got a cell phone, she should have access,"" he said.    A 2021 study found that women who live in remote areas of the US could benefit from telehealth visits, which would decrease the number of ""in-person prenatal care visits and increase access to care.""   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 12 to 14 prenatal care appointments for women with low-risk pregnancies, and the study suggests that expansion of prenatal telehealth appointments could help women living in remote areas better adhere to those guidelines.    Ouma works with mothers who are typically remote and high-risk, Haeri says.     He also believes that promoting midwifery and doula services would help bolster maternity care in the US.    Certified nurse midwives often assist remote mothers who are high-risk or who decide to give birth at home, he says.    Midwives not only deliver babies, they often work with medical equipment and can administer at-home physical exams, prescribe medications, order lab and diagnostic tests, and assess risk management, according to the American College of Nurse Midwives. Doulas -- who guide mothers through the birthing process -- are often present at home births and even hospital births.   ""That midwifery model shines when it comes to maternal care. [And] doula advocacy involvement leads to better outcomes and maternity care, and I think as a system,

                      At least seven fires and one injury that were related to some FreeStyle Libre glucose monitor products have led the US Food and Drug Administration to issue a Class I recall, the agency's strongest, which suggests that use of a device could cause ""serious injuries or death."" The manufacturer, Abbott, says there have been 206 incidents related to these monitors since 2014. But no users have died due to the problem, nor have there been any serious adverse health consequences.  The issue affects more than 4.2 million devices across the US, the FDA says. Abbott initiated a voluntary medical device correction in February on its FreeStyle Libre, FreeStyle Libre 14 day and FreeStyle Libre 2 Readers in the US because of reports from some users that the readers' lithium-ion batteries swelled, overheated and, in some cases, generated sparks or even caused a fire.  ""No FreeStyle Libre readers are being physically recalled and customers can continue to safely use their readers with the Abbott-provided USB cable and power adapter. Customers do not need to return their readers. The steps outlined at www.FreeStyleBattery.com provide guidance on how to properly store, charge and use a reader and its accompanying USB cable and power adapter,"" Abbott told CNN in an email Friday.  The company sent letters to some users of the FreeStyle Libre readers on February 13. People with diabetes use glucose monitors to check their blood sugar levels because of problems with how their body makes or uses insulin, a hormone that helps blood sugar enter cells, where it is used for energy. Without insulin, sugar can build up in the bloodstream and break down the body's own fat and muscle.   A continuous glucose monitor uses a handheld device that reads a sensor placed on the back of the person's upper arm to capture real-time glucose levels.  The monitor used with the FreeStyle Libre line uses lithium-ion batteries similar to those in a mobile phone. The battery is recharged with a yellow USB cable that Abbott provides with the equipment and which limits electric current to safely charge the battery. Use of other USB cables or power adapters, along with misuse of the equipment such as damage or exposure to liquids, may increase the risk of fire, the FDA's recall says.  The problem involves only the reader, not the sensor that the person wears on their arm. Unlike more common recalls in which customers are told to dispose of or return their items, this type of correction instructs users to continue using their devices but only with the equipment provided to recharge the device. The equipment should also be properly stored between temperatures of -4 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The reader should never be put in water, and the USB port should be kept clean. More information is available in the device's user guide. Users of these glucose monitoring devices also have the option to use an app on their phone to receive the glucose data, but this requires a new sensor, the FDA said. Customers who have questions or who want to learn about testing, storing charging or using their reader can visit www.FreeStyleBattery.com or contact Abbott customer service at 1-855-632-8658. Customers may also contact Abbott if they need a replacement power adapter or yellow USB cable.

                      What is mifepristone, the drug at the heart of the Texas medication abortion lawsuit?

                    ","
                      A federal judge in Texas has said he will suspend the approval of mifepristone, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration that has been shown to be safe and effective for more than two decades, although he is pausing his ruling for seven days so the federal government can appeal.  The lawsuit from anti-abortion advocates claims that the drug is not safe and that the FDA didn't study it enough to approve it. Along with misoprostol, mifepristone is one of the drugs used for an abortion via medication, as opposed to surgery.  Mifepristone is marketed under the brand names Mifeprex and Korlym, and it's sometimes known as RU 486. How mifepristone works Mifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which helps the body maintain the inside of the uterus so a pregnancy can continue. A healthy uterine lining is what supports a fertilized egg, embryo and fetus. Without progesterone, the uterus will expel its contents. Someone having a medication abortion takes mifepristone and then, after 24 to 48 hours, takes misoprostol. That drug helps empty the uterus through heavy bleeding and muscle contractions. The medications can be taken as soon as someone learns that they are pregnant and up to 70 days or less since the first day of their last period.  This method is effective 99.6% of the time when used to end a pregnancy, studies show.  How safe is mifepristone? Data from hundreds of studies and 23 years of approved use has shown that mifepristone is highly safe and effective, according to 12 of the country's most respected medical associations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, which signed an amicus brief in the Texas case. This medicine combination for abortion is also available in more than 60 other countries. Since its approval in the US in 2000, there have been 5 deaths associated with mifepristone for every 1 million people who used it, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. That means the death rate is 0.0005%. Mifepristone's safety is on par with those of common over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, studies show.  Data analyzed by CNN shows that mifepristone is even safer than some of the most common prescription medications. The risk of death from penicillin, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections like pneumonia, for example, is four times greater than it is for mifepristone. The risk of death after taking Viagra -- used to treat erectile dysfunction -- is nearly 10 times higher. Side effects of mifepristone Mifepristone usually doesn't have many side effects, doctors say, but as with any drug, there can be short-lived ones. Side effects of mifepristone may include dizziness, weakness, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, nausea, and fever or chills, according to the FDA.  Major adverse events like blood loss, hospitalization or a significant infection are ""exceedingly rare,"" happening in less than 0.3% of patients, according to the medical associations' amicus brief. How often is mifepristone used? The mifepristone-misoprostol combination is the most common abortion method in the US. Preliminary data published February 2022 from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on sexual and reproductive health that supports abortion rights, showed that medication abortion accounted for 53% of all abortions in the US.  Misoprostol on its own No matter the status of mifepristone, misoprostol would still be available and could be used for a medication abortion on its own.  The only use of misoprostol that's approved by the FDA is for the prevention and treatment of gastric ulcers. But some doctors use it ""off-label"" by itself for an abortion; it can also have other off-label obstetric or gynecologic uses such as inducing labor.  Studies show that misoprostol alone is effective and safe for an abortion and is a ""reasonable"" option for people who want an abortion in the first trimester, according to a 2019 review of multiple studies, but the two-drug regimen is considered more effective.  This review said that across all studies of people who took only misoprostol, about 78% had complete abortions, and a viable pregnancy was terminated in more than 93% of the cases. At most, 0.2% of cases had serious complications that required a transfusion or hospitalization.  People who take misoprostol on its own for an abortion typically need to take more for it to work, and the side effects can be more intense, said Dr. Melissa L. Wong, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Massachusetts and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. ""Misoprostol still works very well and is very safe,"" Wong said. ""Mifeprestone typically does not cause any side effects as it stops the pregnancy hormone. With misoprostol, some people may tolerate it a bit less because of some side effects like nausea, vomiting, sometimes things like diarrhea or a transient fever. Those are still safe and expected side effects, but they are still uncomfortable for anyone.""

                      The US Food and Drug Administration issued a Class I recall Friday, the most serious type of recall, for certain Philips Respironics DreamStation1 CPAP machines.  A Class I recall means the FDA has determined a reasonable probability that a product could ""cause serious adverse health consequences or death."" ""Philips is recalling certain reworked Philips DreamStations because some devices were assigned incorrect or duplicate serial numbers during initial programming,"" the recall notice says. ""This duplication can cause therapy to be delivered using the wrong prescription or factory default settings. Additionally, it may fail to deliver any therapy at all. There is no warning or indication to the user that the DreamStation is not working the way the doctor intended or prescribed."" The problem could lead to serious health problems such as heart failure, respiratory failure or death, the FDA says. Phillips has received 43 complaints about the issue, but there have been no reported injuries or deaths. These machines help with certain breathing conditions that don't allow people to breathe in a regular rhythm. The machines provide continuous positive airway pressure, known as CPAP, to keep the airways open with a steady stream of air through a mask or bilevel positive airway pressure, also known as BiPAP support, pumping air into the lungs using different pressures.  People who have sleep apnea or obstructive sleep apnea, potentially serious disorders in which they may stop breathing at night, can use these machines to keep their airways open during sleep.  The recall involves 1,088 machines distributed from December 1, 2021, to October 31, 2022.  Philips has sent letters to affected customers to encourage them to continue to use the devices until a replacement is sent or their health care provider makes pressure changes  on their current device. The fastest way to manage the problem, the FDA says, is to contact the provider to ask about a manual reset of pressure, either remotely or in person.

                      Gardening has taken off. Here's why the popular activity can replace your gym workout

                      A lot of people find it difficult to embrace the idea of regular exercise, even though they know it's good for their physical and mental health. Yet committing to a workout routine doesn't necessarily entail going to the gym or running around your neighborhood. Gardening is a great example of a popular hobby that's accessible and can also be used as a workout.  Working in your garden or yard is a source of moderate to vigorous physical activity in younger adults, while providing low to moderate physical activity in older adults, research has shown. The pastime is also a muscle-strengthening activity, according to the US Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, and one of the physical activities with the lowest injury rates. More good news: Puttering in your garden just two hours a week could help boost your mood, while the communal gardening that's proliferating in communities and schools provides social benefits that can alleviate stress and help combat isolation and even dementia, according to studies. With all these benefits, gardening for fitness will be a trend this year, predicts Rishi Mandal, San Francisco-based cofounder and CEO of the fitness coaching app Future. ""Our clients at Future have already been asking their coaches to add gardening and landscaping activities into their routines,"" Mandal said, ""because it's easy to access, fits into their lifestyle and offers meditative benefits."" This demand fits with the overall interest he's seeing among clients for less intensive fitness routines that are accessible and mesh with an on-the-go lifestyle. Why gardening is exercise Gardening engages all the major muscle groups, such as the arms, legs, shoulders, back and abdomen, Mandal said. The activity also improves mobility, helps build endurance, and is a comparable workout to walking or Pilates. All the necessary digging, planting, mowing, raking and weeding torches calories, too. A 154-pound person burns an average of 330 calories per hour through gardening, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such activity is similar to what that same person would burn playing golf or dancing.  Tom Adkinson of Nashville has long been on board with the notion of gardening to stay fit. The 72-year-old has three gardens, which he uses primarily to grow tomatoes, sweet banana peppers and okra. The work varies in intensity during the growing season. ""Every year I turn the soil by hand,"" Adkinson said, ""and I consider that serious exercise."" The hours Adkinson spends staking the tomatoes, then watering and weeding all three gardens, involves a lot of bending and stretching, which he likens to performing garden yoga.  Start with a warm-up Just as with traditional exercise, Adkinson warms up beforehand, doing various stretches. That's wise, said Christine Zellers, an assistant professor of family and community health sciences at Rutgers University. ""Even though gardening may not appear strenuous, using the body in new ways can make you stiff if you don't work up to the movement and prepare by limbering up a little,"" said Zellers, who teaches at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension of Cape May County in New Jersey. In addition to stretching, going for a short walk before you begin gardening can also serve as a warm-up. While working in your garden or yard, it's important to bend at the knees to lift heavy objects, she said, and pace yourself if you're new. Just as a new runner would slowly build up miles before tackling a marathon, new gardeners should start with short sessions, gradually increasing the time and intensity spent in their gardens. Build muscle strength and burn calories Once you've got some experience working in your garden or yard, you can ramp things up for more of a challenge. If you've purchased a flat of flowers, bring them to the backyard one at a time. When it's time to mow the lawn, increase the pace of your mowing or switch to a push mower. For some strength training, fill two large watering cans, then carry them around your yard to water the plants.  ""Gardening can provide a sense of accomplishment and reward, in addition to movement, by doing something with your hands that is fulfilling, like feeding your family or making your yard look wonderful,"" Zellers said. For Adkinson, one of the biggest benefits of gardening as exercise is the tangible reward he receives for his efforts. ""Getting fresh tomatoes and fresh okra well into the fall is way better than going to the gym,"" Adkinson said. ""There's really nothing better than your own sliced tomato for a sandwich.""

                      Popular Easter candy Peeps contains additive linked to cancer, Consumer Reports says

                      Most convenient store shelves are well stocked with sugary marshmallow chicks and bunnies in time for Easter.  The original yellow-colored chick is still the best-selling product sold under the Peeps brand, but the popular springtime candy brand is being criticized for containing red dye No. 3 in its pink- and purple-colored candies. Consumer Reports called out several Peeps candies as containing the dye that it said is ""a known carcinogen,"" according to a Monday news release from the nonprofit.  Consumer Reports sent a letter on March 17 to Just Born Quality Confections, which makes the candy, asking for a response by the end of the month. Consumer Reports said the company did not announce ""any plans to change its manufacturing process."" In a statement to CNN via email, Just Born said, ""FD&C Red #3 is currently an approved colorant for use in candy by the (US Food and Drug Administration). We manufacture all our candies in compliance with FDA regulations, sourcing our ingredients and packaging exclusively from reputable suppliers who adhere to high quality and safety standards.""   The company noted that the ingredients are listed on packaging and websites.  Just Born added that its product development team is ""continually exploring opportunities to provide expanded options for our consumers, including colors derived from natural sources that can deliver the same visual impact and stability as their certified counterparts."" Consumer Reports has started a petition for the removal of the colorant in Peeps. ""The widespread use of Red Dye 3 is particularly concerning since it is found in many products marketed to children who are especially at risk of developing health problems from exposure,"" said Michael Hansen, senior staff scientist for Consumer Reports, in a statement. ""Just Born Quality Confections should stop making its iconic marshmallow treats with this dangerous food chemical since other less risky alternatives are readily available,"" Hansen added. This move is not the first push to ban red dye No. 3. In October, Consumer Reports joined more than 20 other organizations to urge the FDA to remove the color additive from its approved list of ingredients.  Recently, a California State Assembly bill was introduced that would ban the sale of food products containing red dye No. 3 and other food additives thought to be harmful by January 2025. The confectionery industry's trade group, of which Just Born is a member, said US companies follow government standards.  ""Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy, as they have been for centuries. Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we do not use any ingredients in our products that do not comply with the FDA's strictest safety standards,"" said Christopher Gindlesperger, senior vice president of public affairs and communications at the National Confectioners Association, via email.  ""Chocolate and candy companies will continue to innovate as new information becomes available and consumer preferences change,"" Gindlesperger added. What is known about red dye No. 3 Nearly 3,000 food products contain the red colorant, according to the Food Scores database created by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization. Red dye No. 3 is approved for use in food and oral drug forms but has been banned in cosmetics since 1990 due to a carcinogenic response in rats. A 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment found that the consumption of red dye No. 3 can cause hyperactivity and other behavioral difficulties in children, concluding that some may be more sensitive than others. And a study published in 2012 suggested that the common food dye can cause cancer in animals, although there is no evidence that it is the same case for humans. While the yellow Peeps do not contain the red dye, concerned consumers should check food labels of other candies when putting together this year's Easter baskets. Any food products containing red dye No. 3 will have the additive listed as FD&C Red #3, as required by the FDA.

                      Wouldn't it be nice if there were some undiscovered ingredient, and one bite of it would cure all our health concerns? There isn't one, sadly.  But scientists do know the recipe to better health, and it is a long-term practice of good habits when it comes to sleep, eating, exercise, socialization and stress.  In honor of the 75th anniversary of the World Health Organization, here are the factors that add up to better health and what you can do today to improve in these areas.   Ask your doctor if you have specific concerns in any of these areas.   Get enough sleep A bad night's rest doesn't just mess with your concentration during the day. So far this year, CNN has reported that not getting enough sleep can increase your risk of mood problems, asthma, stroke and longevity.  Sleep is kind of a big deal. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults get at least seven hours of sleep a night — but quality is important as well. To get more good sleep, research shows it's important to set a schedule for going to bed and waking up, follow a nighttime routine to tell your brain it's time to go to bed, keep your bedroom dark and cool, turn away from the screens early, and don't lay in bed if you are having trouble sleeping.  Eat good food People's individual bodies need different things, but is there a best way to guide your nutrition? According to many scientific studies and U.S. News & World Report's annual rankings, it's the Mediterranean diet.  Don't let the word diet fool you — this isn't a restrictive philosophy to manipulate your body weight. The Mediterranean diet is a way of eating that features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions. Numerous studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. Get some exercise  Scientists have long known that exercise is good for a healthy body, but research has shown it's also important for a healthy mind.  The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that people between the ages of 18 and 64 engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity each week, as well as muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week. The good news is even if you can't get there right now, adding even a little bit will help.  Research published earlier this year showed that even 11 minutes of exercise a day can lower your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease or premature death. Take time to socialize Many people place a lot of importance on some of the health behaviors often thought of as more physical, but social and emotional factors deserve our attention as well.  And good, strong friendships are key to not just alleviating our stress and improving emotional well-being, but also boosting markers of our physical health, according to the latest research.  People should grow this area of health by investing more in a feeling of community, experts have suggested. They also stressed the importance of making friendship a priority in your schedule: Text a friend that you haven't talked to in a long time, commit to meeting one new person a month, host a dinner party or join a class. Strong bonds won't happen overnight, but starting small and prioritizing friendships as an important part of your life can bring more happiness, less stress and more support, workplace belonging expert Adam Smiley Poswolsky told CNN earlier this year.  ""Even when — especially when — their friend is struggling or going through something hard,"" said Poswolsky who is also author of ""Friendship in the Age of Loneliness: An Optimist's Guide to Connection."" ""You know someone is a true friend when they have your back when you're sick, when you lose your job, when you make a mistake, when you're going through a break-up, when you're stressed, when you're sad."" Reduce your stress  I know I've heard it every time I go to the doctor for any concern: Whatever it is, it gets worse with stress.  Sure enough, stress can send a body into fight or fligh, which raises cortisol. Higher levels of cortisol can exacerbate health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic gastrointestinal problems, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  Stress can also cause or contribute to anxiety, irritability, poor sleep, substance abuse, chronic distrust or worry, and more. Fortunately, a balanced diet, good sleep, exercise and social support can help with stress reduction. It can also help to explore breathing and meditation techniques. You may be thinking, I am already stretched thin in my day — adding in all these health behaviors will cause stress by itself.  The good news is that these habits are best added with small, manageable changes over a period of time.  Approach your goals one bite at a time and with a plan, flexibility, fun and support, and you may soon find you've made the changes you are looking for, said Katy Milkman, the James G. Dinan Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, author of ""How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be.""

                      Life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth risks can vary depending on where you live, study finds

                      The risks of severe complications during pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum can vary drastically depending on where the person lives, a new study suggests. Among people with Medicaid insurance in the United States, rates of severe maternal morbidity -- life-threatening complications during pregnancy, delivery or after childbirth -- range dramatically from about 80 cases for every 10,000 live births in Utah to more than 200 per 10,000 in the District of Columbia, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.  That means rates of severe complications were about 2.5 times higher in DC than in Utah.  ""We expected some variation at the state level. We didn't necessarily think it was going to be a three-fold difference. So that was a pretty striking finding,"" said lead study author Dr. Lindsay Admon, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School and obstetrician-gynecologist at U-M Health Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital. In the United States, attention is growing on maternal death rates and the fact that the nation has the highest rate of mothers dying in pregnancy or childbirth than other high-income countries. Just last month, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that the rising US maternal death rate climbed significantly yet again in 2021, reaching 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 23.8 in 2020. But maternal morbidity remains a public health issue too, Admon said. ""Maternal morbidity is 70 times more common than mortality,"" she said. ""These are severe adverse events as well, and I think these are the first time we've really had broad scale data at the state level about what the leading factors are in individual states."" Where severe maternal morbidity is highest The study authors -- from the University of Michigan, Boston University, Columbia University and the University of Minnesota -- analyzed Medicaid data on 4.8 million live births across 49 states and Washington, DC, from 2016 to 2018. They examined overall and state-level rates of severe maternal morbidity, occurring within 42 days before or after delivery.  ""The data that we were able to put together reflects nearly half of all births occurring during the study period,"" Admon said. Medicaid finances 41% of births in the United States. The data showed that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity among pregnant Medicaid patients, that did not involve blood transfusions, was 146.2 cases for every 10,000 deliveries -- and those rates ranged depending on where the person lived. The five states with the lowest rates of severe maternal morbidity, according to the data, were Utah, with a rate of 80.3 per 10,000; Maryland at 81.3; Rhode Island at 84.4; Nebraska at 88; and New Hampshire at 91.1. The jurisdictions with the highest rates were Washington, DC, at 210.4 per 10,000; California at 190.5; Nevada at 187.1; New Jersey at 180.6; and New York at 174.6. The most frequently identified cause of complications for patients was eclampsia, a serious condition involving high blood pressure during pregnancy, which can lead to seizures. Other leading causes of complications were acute respiratory distress in which fluid collects in the lungs, abnormal blood clotting and sepsis, a serious complication of an infection. ""For states where sepsis or severe infection is a leading indicator of maternal morbidity, an intervention might be to really focus their resources on early treatment of sepsis, on patient and community awareness of what sepsis is, and what the signs and symptoms are to look out for to seek care,"" Admon said. ""In many states, eclampsia, which is a severe complication of hypertension in pregnancy resulting in a seizure, was a leading cause of morbidity, and in those states, I would hope that folks would think 'OK, we really need to educate our population, our clinicians about hypertension in pregnancy,' "" she said. ""We know that complications from chronic conditions are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, and individuals in the US have been giving birth at older ages -- with more chronic conditions, with more severe chronic conditions -- for the last couple of decades."" 'There's a huge racial disparity' The types of complications that can happen during pregnancy or childbirth also appeared to vary when the data was analyzed by race.  ""When we looked at the leading causes of morbidity among the Black and White populations among Medicaid beneficiaries, basically, eclampsia was leading among the non-Hispanic Black population and sepsis among the non-Hispanic White,"" Admon said. However, Black patients still had a higher rate of sepsis than White patients.  ""There are six things that occur at higher rates among the non-Hispanic Black population,"" Admon said: eclampsia, heart failure, acute kidney failure, respiratory distress, sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which causes blood clotting. In states where race and ethnicity data were available, the researchers found that the overall rate of severe maternal morbidity was 2.1 per 100 live births among Black patients with Medicaid, compared with 1.3 per 100 live births among White patients. ""The research really highlights that we have a long way to go still towards achieving maternal health equity in the US,"" Admon said. ""I think it's structural racism and that there's a great deal of implicit and explicit bias that happens with health care, and those are really important issues that we need to tackle."" The findings came as no surprise to Dr. Zsakeba Henderson, senior health adviser for the nonprofit National Institute for Children's Health Quality in Boston, an expert on maternal and infant health inequities. ""The main reason why I'm not surprised is that we already know that there are significant racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality in our country, with Black women three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes,"" said Henderson, who was not involved with the new research. ""And the main disparities that we see in mortality, we also see in morbidity."" In other words, the factors behind racial disparities seen in maternal mortality could be some of the same factors driving state-by-state differences in severe maternal morbidity rates.  For example, the area with the highest morbidity rates in the new study was Washington, DC. According to a report released last year by the DC Maternal Mortality Review Committee, nearly all of the pregnancy-related deaths in DC -- 90% -- were among Black mothers, even though they constitute roughly half of all births there. ""So to see that DC had the highest morbidity was not surprising to me at all,"" Henderson said.  ""We can't deny the fact that there's a huge racial disparity, and so I suspect that states that have higher populations of Black pregnant moms, who tend to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality, are likely to have higher numbers of severe morbidity,"" she said.  The new findings can help guide discussions around what needs to be done to reduce rates of maternal morbidity in the United States, as well as the disparities by state and race, said Dr. Sarosh Rana, section chief of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Chicago Medicine, who was not involved in the new study. ""It's nice to have this data for people who are policymakers at the level of the state but also physicians and institutional leaders like myself. This data will help guide implementation of quality improvement initiatives and provide equitable care,"" Rana said.   The new study is ""eye-opening"" and ""can begin to inform clinical care, quality improvement, and policy change with regard to maternal morbidity and mortality,"" Dr. Doee Kitessa, a general obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center and an assistant professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said in an email Thursday. ""This study can help hospitals and states target quality improvement initiatives toward the leading indicator of severe maternal morbidity,"" said Kitessa, who was not involved with the research. ""While the data is based on billing codes and not patient charts, it's an excellent start to understanding the causes of maternal morbidity by state and the disparities that exist,"" she said. ""This can help states and healthcare institutions begin to address and work to decrease the rates of severe maternal morbidity that are affecting the patients they care for."" 'It is important to listen to patients' Some policies have been introduced to tackle the United States' maternal health crisis. At the federal level, the Black Maternal ""Momnibus"" Act of 2021, a sweeping bipartisan package of bills, aims to provide pre- and post-natal support for Black mothers, such as by extending eligibility for certain benefits postpartum.  Yet within individual health care systems, it's important for physicians and leaders to pay attention to disparities in obstetrical care, Rana said, and among other factors that can lead to disparities, a key component is implicit bias in the care of Black women.  ""I think it is important to listen to patients when they raise concerns and for expecting mothers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy or childbirth complications. There are actually lots of signs that doctors should be talking about and that patients should be aware of,"" Rana said, adding that common warning signs of preeclampsia and eclampsia, for instance, are headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and swelling of the hands or face.  ""What I feel is, sometimes there's a gap between a patient complaining and the doctor listening. There is so much data showing that patients, especially African American Black patients, are not always listened to,"" she said. ""That's another barrier that a lot of our patients face, and it contributes to racial disparities.""

                      FDA takes only drug for premature birth off the market

                      On Thursday, the US Food and Drug Administration announced its final decision to withdraw its approval of Makena, a drug approved more than a decade ago to reduce the risk of preterm birth that had been the only medication approved for the condition.  The FDA says that the drug is not effective and that the benefits of taking it do not outweigh the risks.  ""It is tragic that the scientific research and medical communities have not yet found a treatment shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes -- particularly in light of the fact that this serious condition has a disparate impact on communities of color, especially Black women,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. ""Fundamentally, however, the touchstone of FDA drug approval is a favorable benefit-risk assessment; without that favorable assessment, the drug should not have the status of being FDA-approved."" About 1 in 10 infants born in the US are preterm, before 37 weeks of pregnancy. The lungs and brain finish developing in the last few months of pregnancy, and preterm birth places the baby and the mother at higher risk of death and disability.  The condition disproportionately affects Black women, for whom the rate is about 50% higher than the rate for White or Hispanic women, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Preterm birth has also been a growing problem in the US. The CDC says the rate rose 4% from 10.1% in 2020 to 10.5% in 2021. Before Makena, there were no reliable medication options for these patients, so it went through the FDA's accelerated approval process. That process is used when there's no reliable treatment for a condition and a drug shows promise in clinical trials. The FDA created it in the height of the AIDS epidemic, when people were dying in record numbers with no options. Accelerated approval means a drug doesn't have to go through all the levels of testing in humans that are required for the standard approval process.  Makena was approved in 2011 for women who have a history of spontaneous preterm delivery after a clinical trial showed a reduction in the rate of preterm births but no direct clinical benefit.  One condition of accelerated approval is that, even after the drug hits the market, the company must continue to test it in people to make sure it works.  In the years since Makena was approved, drugmaker Covis says, about 350,000 women have been treated with it. But a large 2019 study failed to show that it actually prevented preterm birth.  In October 2020, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research met to take a closer look at the research, and it recommended that the FDA withdraw approval for the drug.  The drug and its generic equivalents were allowed to remain on the market until the manufacturer removed them or the FDA commissioner mandated removal.  In October, the FDA's Obstetrics, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted that Makena should not remain on the market. It also voted that a postmarket trial didn't show any benefit to babies and that the evidence didn't show that Makena reduced the risk of preterm birth in women who had had one before. Last month, Covis said it was moving to withdraw the medication from the market. Covis said that soon after the committee hearing, it outlined a plan for withdrawal that included a wind-down period allowing patients to finish the 21-week course of treatment. However, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research rejected the plan. ""While we stand by Makena's favorable risk-benefit profile, including its efficacy in women at highest risk of preterm birth, we are seeking to voluntarily withdraw the product and work with the FDA to effectuate an orderly wind-down,"" Covis Pharma Chief Innovation Officer Dr. Raghav Chari said in a news release at the time. Effective Thursday, the FDA says, Makena and its generics are no longer approved and cannot lawfully be distributed in interstate commerce. The FDA said that although the approvals of Makena and its generics have been withdrawn, it recognizes that a supply of product has been distributed. It said patients who have questions should talk to their health care provider.  Dr. Sean Blackwell, chair of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences with UTHealth Houston, said he understands that the FDA does not want to expose people to risk or to unnecessary cost, but he disagrees with the interpretation of the research and the decision to withdraw the drug from the market.  ""I certainly have had some women that had a prior preterm birth, and then I put them on Makena and had good outcomes. So for those patients, they're going to be  distressed that they used a medication and it worked for them, and now it's no longer available,"" he said.  There are no good options, he said. ""Doctors are going to want to do something. They're not going to just be OK with saying, 'there's nothing we can do. We'll just sit on our hands,' "" Blackwell said. The other medication alternative is vaginal progesterone, he said, but trials have shown that it is not necessarily effective, either.  Doctors may have to rely on surgical approaches to prevent preterm birth, ""but it's surgery. It has side effects. It has risks,"" Blackwell said. ""I do think that going forward, it's going to be really hard.""

                      WHO official criticizes China's 'inexcusable' lack of transparency on pandemic's origins

                      The World Health Organization still does not have key data from China about the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak, putting the world in jeopardy, says Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the group's Covid-19 technical lead and head of its program on emerging diseases. ""The lack of data disclosure is simply inexcusable,"" Van Kerkhove wrote in an editorial in the journal Science on Thursday. ""The longer it takes to understand the origins of the pandemic, the harder it becomes to answer the question, and the more unsafe the world becomes."" Understanding how the disease emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 would help prevent future outbreaks, Van Kerkhove said. It was only this year, three years after the start of the pandemic, that WHO got access to certain data that Chinese scientists had gathered in early 2020 at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan. The raw genetic sequences from the samples had recently been uploaded to the data-sharing site GISAID. They were soon removed, but quick-thinking researchers had already noticed them and downloaded them for further study. An analysis of that material uncovered animal DNA in samples already known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. A significant amount of that DNA seemed to belong to animals known as raccoon dogs, which had been on sale at the market, WHO officials said in March. Although the sequences showed that the animal could have been an intermediate host and that the market amplified the spread of the virus, the data did not show that people who interacted with those animals got sick through that exposure. In other words, the findings did not settle the question of how the pandemic started. To do so, scientists would need to trace the animals to the source of the virus. WHO also needs access to test results from workers at the market.  Three years later, Van Kerkhove said, WHO still does not have access to the raw data China collected from early Covid-19 cases.  With China's advanced technical capabilities, she firmly believes, it has more essential information that it is not sharing.  Van Kerkhove says China could have more unshared information about things like the wild and farmed animal trade, the testing of humans and animals in Wuhan and across China, the operations of labs in Wuhan that worked with coronaviruses, and the first cases. The failure to share information, she said, only fuels politicization of the origin of the virus.  ""The world needs to move away from the politics of blame and, instead, exploit all diplomatic and scientific approaches so that the global scientific community can do what it does best -- collaborate, focus on this health crisis, and find evidence-based solutions to thwart future pandemics,"" Van Kerkhove wrote. It's still not clear whether the Covid-19 pandemic began with a lab leak or with spillover from animals. Many scientists believe that the virus naturally moved from animals to humans. Intelligence agencies like the US Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and the FBI endorse the theory that that virus spread out of a Chinese lab. Without more data from China from early in the pandemic, it may never be proved. This is not the first time Van Kerkhove has been vocal about China's lack of transparency about Covid, nor is she the only world leader to call on China to be forthcoming about the beginnings of the pandemic.  In March, Van Kerkhove described to Science WHO's late discovery of the Chinese data about the market as ""beyond infuriating,"" calling the lack of collaboration  ""scary as hell."" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of President Joe Biden's Covid task force during the presidential transition, said Van Kerkhove's editorial puts WHO on the record on the issue.  ""Will that be a compelling incentive for China to share more? No. They're going to do what they're going to do,"" Osterholm said.  ""I am not optimistic,"" he added. It will never be fruitful to spend time and attention on getting data from China to pinpoint what happened with Covid, Osterholm said.  ""My whole message is that we've got to prepare for lab leaks or spillover events,"" he said. WHO plans to publish a status report about what it knows about the origins of Covid-19 this year.  In the meantime, it's encouraging all countries, not just China, to share what they know to help solve the mystery and fight future pandemics. Collaboration is key, as is finding evidence-based solutions, Van Kerkhove believes.  ""Time is running out,"" she wrote.

                      More than 90,000 people in the United States are waiting for a kidney donation, but Dr. Aleksandra Gmurczyk helped take two people off the waitlist when she donated her own kidney to Ginger, a woman she had never met, and launching a kidney-paired donation.  A kidney-paired donation happens when a person is willing to donate a kidney to someone in their life who needs it, but they aren't a good match, so they swap recipients with another donor.  In this case, Gmurczyk's kidney was donated in February to Ginger, who had ""hard-to-match"" kidneys. Ginger's husband, Gary, was not a match for his wife. He donated his kidney to a Northwestern Medicine patient.  Ginger and Gary did not want their last name reported. ""I am so glad to meet you,"" Gmurczyk, a nephrologist and associate professor at Northwestern Medicine, told Ginger when meeting her at a news conference Thursday. ""I'm so glad you got my kidney, and I can tell you're going to take really good care of it."" ""I did not want to donate specifically to one person,"" Gmurczyk told CNN, adding that with a kidney-paired donation, she felt like she had a chance to help more people.  In 2020, there were 22,817 kidney transplants performed in the United States because of conditions like kidney disease or failure, according to the National Institutes of Health. On average, it takes about three to five years for a patient to be matched with a kidney donor, according to the National Kidney Foundation.  Doctors have donated their own kidneys to patients before: According to Maine Health, Dr. Aji Djamali, chair of the Department of Medicine at Maine Medical Center, donated his kidney to a former patient last year.  In 2002, Dr. Susan Hou, a nephrologist at Michael Reese Hospital, Rush University Medical Center and Loyola University Medical Center, donated her kidney to a patient, according to the Wednesday Journal of Oak Park and River Forest.  But Gmurczyk wanted to donate to help educate patients.  She often sees patients who have kidney failure, which renders their kidneys unable to filter waste and toxins out of their bloodstream. Many undergo dialysis, a taxing treatment that helps remove waste and extra fluids from the blood.  Although treatment varies depending on the level of care needed, dialysis is typically done three times a week for about four hours at a time, according to the National Kidney Foundation.  ""It's like a part-time job,"" Gmurczyk said. ""It is stressful, and it is sad, and they feel isolated and lonely. Many of them work, but not many of them can."" Before the transplant, Ginger was undergoing dialysis.  ""It would have been two years yesterday that I started dialysis,"" she said. ""About a week or two before I got my transplant ... it started getting worse."" Despite the long list of people awaiting donation, some of Gmurczyk's patients are still leery of undergoing a transplant because of things like mistrust of the health care system or the requirements for donation. Nine years ago, Gmurczyk began thinking about how she could change those people's minds. She decided to donate one of her own kidneys to help increase the level of trust in the procedure and to inspire others to donate.  ""The reason why I wanted to donate is that ... I can go to them and say, 'I donated my kidney, and I believe that people who receive a kidney transplant live longer, healthier lives, and I believe in this so much that I donated,' "" she said.  Gmurczyk says kidney donations from living people usually begin working immediately and can function for twice as long as those from deceased donors: 15 to 20 years vs. 10 to 12 years, respectively.  She applied to join a donation pool, which led to the kidney-paired model.  After she was matched with Ginger in Virginia, Gmurczyk's donor journey was a typical one, including things like kidney function tests and abdomen screenings to find the smaller kidney, which is ultimately donated.  Her care team included another nephrologist, a pharmacist, a surgeon, a social worker and a donor advocate.  Donor advocates work to ensure that donors are not being coerced or paid to have the procedure. Social workers help the donor set up the best social support to make sure they are taken care of at home after the procedure.  ""People who get a transplant need a social support person, and a lot of people do not even have one person to help them after the transplant,"" Gmurczyk said.  After she had the surgery and spent the night in the hospital, a friend came to help her get home, but Gmurczyk felt well enough to walk.  ""I was able to take care of my dog the next day,"" she said. ""I was doing everything for myself.""  She took two weeks off work and did not have any problems returning.  Her decision to donate has already paid off, she says: One of her patients who had been skeptical of getting a kidney transplant was inspired to begin the evaluation process.  At Thursday's news conference, Gary also met his recipient, Arturo ""Art"" Reyes. Reyes was particularly emotional.  ""I didn't think there was any hope anymore,"" he said. ""There's really no words to say thank you. You've given me life back.""

                      CDC warns doctors to watch for Marburg virus amid outbreaks in two African nations

                      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory Thursday about the Marburg virus outbreak in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania.  Marburg is a rare but highly fatal viral fever that causes uncontrolled bleeding, similar to Ebola. The CDC's warning says that although there are no cases in the United States and the current risk is low, health care providers should be on the lookout for any imported cases.  Providers who suspect that someone is sick with Marburg virus should take a detailed travel history, the CDC said. The patient should be managed under isolation until there is a negative test, and the local health department should be contacted immediately.  Marburg virus is not contagious until symptoms appear. These can include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms and unexplained bleeding.  It can spread through contact with an infected person's blood and other body fluids or through fluids from infected animals. It does not spread through the air like the virus that causes Covid-19.  There is no specific vaccine or treatment for the disease. Early intensive supportive care, the CDC said, may keep people from getting seriously ill or dying.  In March, the CDC warned travelers to Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania to avoid contact with sick people and to monitor their health for three weeks after visiting those countries. The agency posted notices in international airports reminding people to watch for symptoms and to see a doctor immediately if they feel sick. It's also sending text messages to travelers who have been in those countries.  The CDC has sent staff to Africa to help fight the outbreaks, which are the first reported in either Equatorial Guinea or Tanzania. Authorities were made aware of the outbreak in Equatorial Guinea in early February. On February 7, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for Equatorial Guinea announced that there had been a cluster of deaths in early January.  In late March, the Ministry of Health of Tanzania announced an outbreak in the northwest part of the country. As of April 5, there have been eight lab-confirmed cases, and five of those people have died. The CDC said there is no evidence to suggest that the two outbreaks are related. Most experts agree that these cases represent two independent animal-to-human spillover events.  In addition to avoiding areas where there are known outbreaks, there are ways to keep yourself safe from Marburg virus, the CDC said. Avoid contact with blood and bodily fluids from people who are sick. If attending a funeral for someone who has died from the disease, take care not to touch the body. Also avoid contact with fruit bats and primates in areas where there are outbreaks, since both animals are known to be carriers for the virus.

                      The World Health Organization is monitoring the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16, which has been identified in about two dozen countries.  The subvariant has not been found in the United States, but it is similar to the XBB.1.5 subvariant that has been dominant in the country since January.  XBB.1.16 has one additional mutation that, according to lab studies, makes it more infectious and potentially more pathogenic, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said at a recent briefing.    ""This is one to watch,"" she said. ""It's been in circulation for a few months. We haven't seen a change in severity in individuals or in populations, but that's why we have these systems in place.""  Most of the samples of XBB.1.16 are from India, where it has become dominant. Weekly Covid-19 cases in the country have more than doubled in the past week but remain far below peak levels, WHO data shows. Omicron remains the variant of concern worldwide and hundreds of sublineages continue to circulate.  ""We are in a much better situation than we were since the beginning of this pandemic,"" Van Kerkhove said. ""One of the big uncertainties we face going forward is the virus itself. It hasn't settled into a predictable pattern. It continues to evolve."" The number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths continues to fall in the United States. Less than 1% of counties in the United States have a Covid-19 community level of high, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

                      Late-stage RSV vaccine trials show 'exciting promise,' some scientists say

                      A Pfizer vaccine to protect older adults and infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection has shown what some scientists are calling ""exciting"" promise in late-stage trials. In one company-funded trial in adults 60 and older, the results of which were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the vaccine prevented RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness -- which includes acute bronchitis and pneumonia -- and prevented RSV-associated acute respiratory illness, with no apparent safety concerns. In another company trial, whose interim results were also published in the journal on Wednesday, the RSV vaccine was given during late-stage pregnancy and was found to be effective against severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, or inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs, in infants. There were no safety concerns identified. Pfizer is seeking the US Food and Drug Administration's approval for its RSV vaccine for older adults.  In a separate request, Pfizer has asked the FDA to approve its RSV vaccine with pregnant people to protect infants. The company says it expects that decision by August. The FDA is also considering a monoclonal antibody treatment that's designed to protect children up to 2 years old.  In March, vaccine advisers to the FDA voted in favor of approving RSV vaccine candidates from Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for adults over 60.  The vaccines could become the world's first if the FDA commissioner agrees with the advisory committee. Why an RSV vaccine is needed RSV is ubiquitous. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says most kids will catch this highly contagious respiratory virus at some point before they turn 2.  Although RSV is a mild infection for most, for some groups like infants and the elderly, it can be serious enough to cause hospitalization or death. ""When I started my residency 30 years ago, RSV season was literally a horrifying event for us in pediatrics,"" said Dr. Claudia Hoyen, director of pediatric infection control at UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, who was not involved in the new studies.  Providers would work hard to save babies who were in the NICU for other reasons, she said, but when RSV season would come around, they'd lose many of those babies. ""It was just ... heartbreaking,"" Hoyen said.  The introduction of monoclonal antibodies for these most vulnerable infants made RSV survivable for many, but still some are lost to the virus.  Globally, about 64 million people get sick with RSV each year, and 160,000 die, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.  During last year's especially bad RSV season, some children's hospitals had to set up tents in their parking lots to deal with the overflow of patients. But even in a typical RSV season, hospitals stay busy. In a single year, there are about 34 million episodes of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections in children under the age of 5, and about 10% need to go to the hospital for treatment, studies show. In fact, the virus is the No. 1 reason infants in the US have to go to the hospital.  Tens of thousands of older adults are also hospitalized every year, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. RSV is costly, too. Every year, the US spends more than $709.6 million on hospitalization for infants with RSV alone, studies show. An inauspicious start There is no specific treatment for RSV. Some babies who are more vulnerable to severe disease can get a monoclonal antibody, but it's been difficult to administer and requires parents to come into the clinic at least once a month during RSV season. A vaccine would be incredibly helpful, doctors say, but trials have been stalled until recently. In the 1960s, a disastrous RSV vaccine effort using an inactivated virus saw the hospitalizations of 80% of vaccinated children who later caught RSV. Only 5% of the young participants who got a placebo were hospitalized.  Further trials were put on hold for years as scientists worked to determine what went wrong. In the meantime, the US government created more guardrails to make clinical trials safer going forward. A decade agom a research team at the National Institutes of Health figured out a key mechanism of the virus. Scientists could build on that knowledge to create safe vaccines that would recognize the virus when it invaded the body and trigger the body to develop strong protection against it.  The RSV vaccine race Until recently, four companies had RSV vaccines for seniors in the final phases of trials.  Johnson & Johnson's vaccine division, Janssen, was far along. But at the end of March, the company announced that it was abandoning its candidate.  J&J said the vaccine was lost in the company's ""broader effort to make strategic choices for its pipeline and research and development (R&D) investments to focus on medicines with the greatest potential benefit to patients.""  That leaves Bavarian Nordic as the other company focused on a vaccine for the elderly. Results from its trial are expected in the middle of this year. The vaccines by the numbers When the FDA's independent vaccine advisers voted to recommend that the agency approve Pfizer and GSK's vaccines for seniors, the companies showed promising data. GSK's RSV vaccine candidate for older adults was 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease, according to a company-funded study published in NEJM in February. The shot was 94.1% effective at preventing severe disease. For Pfizer's vaccine for people 60 and older, Wednesday's studies showed 66.7% efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with two or more signs or symptoms and 85.7% vaccine efficacy against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness with three or more signs or symptoms.  The study says there were not enough cases of severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, meaning hospitalization or a need for ventilation or extra oxygen, to derive that effectiveness. One reason may be that the trials were conducted during the Covid-19 pandemic, when there weren't as many RSV cases as usual, Dr. Ann Falsey said.  ""Event rates were low. So, for that reason, they just could not say that it decreased hospitalization, but in my mind, anything that prevents ARI, respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract infection will clearly lead to less hospitalizations. This makes immense sense, but they didn't prove it,"" said Falsey, who was involved in the new research and cares for elderly RSV patients. She is a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.  The Pfizer vaccine was considered safe, according to the study.  Among the 20,000 recipients in the trial, there was one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves, a week after vaccination. Company documents show that the case was considered life-threatening, but there may have been a compounding factor, because the person had a heart attack the day before doctors noted the Guillain-Barre. There was also a case of Miller-Fisher syndrome, another rare nerve disease that's considered a variant of Guillain-Barré. The person developed the disease eight days after vaccination but recovered after about a month and a half.  During the independent FDA advisers' discussion about the vaccine, Dr. Hana El Sahly, chair of the committee and a professor of virology at the Baylor College of Medicine, said that the two cases put the rate of the condition at about 1 in 9,000, which is much higher than what is seen in the general population.  A person in the GSK trial also developed Guillain-Barré nine days after getting the vaccine and spent six months in rehabilitation. The FDA considers the case possibly vaccine-related.  If the vaccines are approved, doctors say, it will be important to monitor their safety.  RSV vaccine for young children The interim results of Pfizer's vaccine for infants show that the candidate didn't meet the company's criteria, again most likely because the trial took place during the pandemic, when RSV cases were lower. But research is ongoing.  An editorial published alongside the study Wednesday from Dr. Ruth Karron says ""it is notable that the efficacy against severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness was 81.8% within 90 days after birth and 69.4% within 180 days after birth."" In other words, it didn't necessarily prevent infections, but it kept them from getting worse. Karron -- a professor in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Immunization Research and of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative, who was not involved in the new research -- wondered in the editorial whether this age of RSV vaccine development could be the ""beginning of the end"" of huge RSV outbreaks.  Another study published Wednesday in NEJM focused on nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody to prevent RSV made by AstraZeneca and Sanofi, which has been approved by the European Commission and the UK to prevent infants from getting sick with RSV. The companies have asked the FDA for approval to use the treatment to protect children up to age 2. This study found that through 150 days after injection, efficacy against hospitalization for RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 76.8%, and efficacy against very severe medically attended RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection was 78.6%. Ultimately, in babies carried to term and in late-preterm infants, a single dose provided protection against hospitalization with RSV.  Hoyen thinks it will take a monoclonal antibody treatment as well as a vaccine to protect infants. Many pregnant women don't get vaccinated; at most, only 57% to 61% of pregnant people get shots to protect against the flu and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, according to a 2020 study from the CDC.  ""We try, but overall, we do not do a great job of vaccinating mothers when they're pregnant,"" Hoyen said. Now, it will be up to the government to decide how these vaccines and treatment should be used. Scientists will also be watching to see how long the vaccine provides protection in the next RSV season. Even with all those caveats, health care providers who treat people with RSV say, it's incredible news. ""I'm just unbelievably happy with all of these results. You know, for somebody who's been laboring in the field for more than 30 years, it's immensely satisfying to see both a vaccine for babies who need it and a vaccine for older adults. It's terrific,"" Falsey said.

                      Eating too much 'free sugar' has 45 negative health effects, study finds

                      There are at least 45 good reasons to cut back on added sugar, according to a new study.  Copious research has shown the negative effects of excessive sugar intake on health, which has informed recommendations to limit consumption of ""free"" or added sugar to less than 10% of a person's daily caloric intake.  Still, researchers in China and the United States felt that before developing detailed policies for sugar restriction, the ""quality of existing evidence needs to be comprehensively evaluated,"" according to the study published Wednesday in the journal The BMJ.  In a large review of 73 meta-analyses — which included 8,601 studies — high consumption of added sugar was associated with significantly higher risks of 45 negative health outcomes, including diabetes, gout, obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, cancer, asthma, tooth decay, depression and early death. Free sugars — the type of sugar the authors focused on — are those added during the processing of foods; packaged as table sugar and other sweeteners; and naturally occurring in syrups, honey, fruit juice, vegetable juice, purees, pastes and similar products in which the cellular structure of the food has been broken down, according to the US Food and Drug Administration. This category does not include sugars naturally occurring in dairy or structurally whole fruits and vegetables.  The study ""provides a useful overview of the current state of the science on sugar consumption and our health ... and confirms that eating too much sugar is likely to cause problems,"" said Dr. Maya Adam, director of Health Media Innovation and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine. Adam wasn't involved in the study.   ""Studies like this are helpful in advising patients that seemingly small changes, such as cutting out excess sugar like sugar-sweetened beverages, can have a marked and positive improvement to health,"" said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, who wasn't involved in the study. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that participants with the highest consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages had higher body weight than those with the lowest intake.  ""As a nutrition researcher who served on both the 2010 and 2020 US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees, I can confirm that intake of dietary sugar in the US is more than twice the recommended amount (less than 10% of total daily caloric intake) and while the direct impact of sugar itself offers minimal, if any, nutritional benefits, it further replaces foods that do,"" said Linda Van Horn, professor emeritus of preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, via email. Van Horn wasn't involved in the study.  The connection between sugar and disease Evidence of a link between free sugar and cancer has been limited and controversial, and needs more research, the study's authors said. But the finding, according to the study, could be explained by the known effects of sugar on weight: High sugar consumption has been associated with obesity, which is a strong risk factor for various cancers. The same goes for cardiovascular disease. ""Added sugar intake can promote inflammation in the body, and this can cause stress on the heart and blood vessels, which can lead to increased blood pressure,"" behavioral scientist Brooke Aggarwal told CNN in February. Aggarwal, an assistant professor of medical sciences in the cardiology division at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, wasn't involved in the study.  Highly processed foods, which can have lots of free sugar, have been found to increase inflammation, a risk factor for depression.  ""Whole food carbohydrates take longer to break down into simple sugars, and a part of them — the fiber — can't be broken down at all,"" Adam told CNN in February. ""This means that whole, intact grains don't cause the same spikes in blood sugar that we experience when we eat simple sugars. Blood sugar spikes trigger insulin spikes, which can destabilize our blood glucose and ... be the underlying cause of health problems in the long run.""  Reducing your intake  The findings — in combination with existing guidance from the World Health Organization, World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research — suggest people should limit free sugar intake to less than 25 grams, or about 6 teaspoons, per day. There's that much sugar in 2 ½ chocolate chip cookies, 16 ounces of fruit punch and about 1 ½ tablespoons of honey. A doughnut has around 15 to 30 grams of sugar, according to the Cleveland Clinic.  The authors also recommend reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to less than one serving (about 200 to 355 milliliters) per week. That's the equivalent of an up to 12-ounce soda, Aggarwal said via email.    To change sugar consumption patterns, the authors think ""a combination of widespread public health education and policies worldwide is urgently needed.""  But there are some changes you can begin making on your own.  Be aware of what you're putting in your body by reading nutrition labels when shopping — even the ones on foods you might not think of as sweet, such as bread, breakfast cereals, yogurts or condiments. These foods usually have lots of added sugar, and it adds up, Adam said.  Opt for water sweetened with fruit slices instead of sugary drinks and have fresh or frozen fruit for dessert instead of cakes, cookies or ice cream. Cooking and baking at home more often is one of the best ways to reduce sugar intake, Aggarwal said.  Getting enough good-quality sleep on a regular basis would also help ""as we tend to choose foods higher in sugar when we're tired,"" Aggarwal said. Cutting back gradually can help you train your taste buds to crave less sugar.  ""Our lives will probably end up being sweeter with less sugar in our diets,"" Adam said.

                      US health officials have issued a final rule that not only makes some changes to Medicare -- including expanding access to behavioral health care and clarifying criteria guidelines -- it cracks down on ""misleading"" advertisements.  On Wednesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services, through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, finalized the rule that, among other things, prohibits advertisements that do not mention a specific plan name and use Medicare logos or language in a way that could mislead and confuse enrollees into believing that the ads come from the government. The measures are the latest in the Biden administration's efforts to rein in Medicare Advantage plans, which have been soaring in popularity. About half of Medicare participants are enrolled in these plans, which are run by insurers that contract with the federal government.  According to CMS, the ""proliferation of certain television advertisements"" promoting enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans -- which are offered by Medicare-approved private companies -- has been concerning.    ""Today, we're announcing a rule that will crack down on misleading marketing schemes by the health insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage plans, those that offer Part D prescription drug plans and their downstream entities. Among other provisions, the rule would prohibit overly general ads about the Medicare Advantage program that often tends to confuse and mislead those individuals who are eligible to apply for some of these insurance plans,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said Wednesday.  In general, about 65 million Americans are within the Medicare program, according to Becerra. ""Any marketing that does not specifically name a health plan, that misrepresents what a plan might offer within these commercials, is something that would now be prohibited,"" he said. ""That's going to be important because the confusion that often arises, and the changes that some enrollees often will make to their detriment in getting health care, are things that we want to try to avoid."" Last year, the Senate Finance Committee released a report highlighting an increase in such deceptive marketing practices that target seniors with Medicare Advantage plans and recommending that CMS take action to reduce the prevalence of such marketing tactics.   ""We've heard from many seniors and people with disabilities about misleading and confusing advertising for Medicare Advantage and Part D plans. Today's final rule includes changes to protect people exploring Medicare Advantage and Part D coverage from confusing and potentially misleading marketing practices,"" Dr. Meena Seshamani, CMS deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicare, said Wednesday. ""We are finalizing 21 marketing provisions to protect beneficiaries."" Beyond marketing requirements, the final rule clarifies criteria guidelines to help ensure that people with Medicare Advantage receive access to the same ""medically necessary"" care they would receive with traditional Medicare.  The rule also expands the list of populations to which Medicare Advantage organizations must provide ""culturally competent"" services, such as people with limited English proficiency or those in the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the rule requires that a prior authorization approval for care remain valid for as long as ""medically necessary"" to avoid disruptions in care for beneficiaries. ""We are also finalizing new minimum wait time standards for behavioral health,"" Seshamani said, as well as requiring that most types of Medicare Advantage plans include behavioral health services. The American Hospital Association said in a statement Wednesday that it applauds the increased attention on Advantage plans. ""Hospitals and health systems have raised the alarm that beneficiaries enrolled in some Medicare Advantage plans are routinely experiencing inappropriate delays and denials for coverage of medically necessary care,"" said Ashley Thompson, the group's senior vice president for public policy analysis and development. ""This rule will go a long way in protecting patients and ensuring timely access to care, as well as reducing inappropriate administrative burden on an already strained health care workforce."" Protecting and strengthening Medicare is one of the administration's top priorities, CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure said in a news release Wednesday. ""With this final rule, CMS is putting in place new safeguards that make it easier for people with Medicare to access the benefits and services they are entitled to, while also strengthening the Medicare Advantage and Part D programs."" On Friday, CMS issued controversial final payment policies for 2024 that seek to limit overbilling by Medicare Advantage plans. The changes include updating the risk adjustment model to better ensure that payments are in line with patients' medical conditions and that insurers don't add diagnoses to inflate their billing.  Insurers protested the proposed rule vehemently, leading CMS to phase in the changes over three years, instead of one.

                      Snoring, snorting, tossing and turning, napping for a long time during the day, waking up during the night, and sleeping too little or even too much all contribute to poor-quality sleep and may raise your risk for stroke, according to a new study. In fact, researchers found the more sleep problems you have, the greater the risk of stroke. ""Having more than five of these symptoms may lead to five times the risk of stroke compared to those who do not have any sleep problems,"" said study author Christine McCarthy of the University of Galway in Ireland in a statement.  ""The findings are consistent with prior research linking unhealthy sleep to high blood pressure and to impairments to blood vessels, which are risk factors for stroke,"" said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved in the study. One reason may be the impact of short, fragmented sleep and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea on the body's ability to regulate metabolism, blood pressure and inflammation, which are all risk factors for stroke, said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern's medical school, who was not involved in the study.  ""Poor sleep can impair the natural blood pressure dipping that occurs during night time sleep and contribute to hypertension — an important risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease,"" Zee said via email. ""In other population based research, similar relationships have been reported between poor sleep health and disorders such as diabetes, heart disease and dementia."" Sleep problems and stroke risk The study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, analyzed data from more than 4,500 people participating in INTERSTROKE, a large international case-control study of patients who have experienced a stroke.  Nearly 1,800 participants in the study had an ischemic stroke, the most common kind, in which a blood clot blocks an artery leading to the brain. Another 439 people had an intracerebral hemorrhage in which arteries or veins in the brain rupture, causing bleeding into brain tissue. Participants in the study were then matched by age and sex to people who had no history of stroke. Both groups answered questions about their sleep quality and behavior, and the two groups were compared. Results showed people who slept less than five hours a night on average were three times more likely to have a stroke than those who got seven hours of sleep — the recommended minimum for adults.  On the flip side, sleeping more than nine hours a night on average was associated with a twofold increase in stroke risk, according to a statement on the study. The results held true even after adjustments to eliminate other issues that can lead to stroke, including depression, alcohol abuse, smoking and a lack of physical activity, according to the study. Having sleep apnea — a condition in which people stop breathing multiple times per hour — was associated with a threefold increase in stroke risk, the statement said.  ""Sleep apnea can alter the pathways involved in the regulation of coagulation factors that can increase the risk of strokes,"" Zee said. Snoring or snorting, which can both be signs of untreated sleep apnea, were also risky. People who snored were 91% more likely to have suffered a stroke, while those who snorted were almost three times as likely to have had a stroke than those who did not.  Napping was also a risk factor, the statement said. People who on average napped more than an hour were 88% more likely to suffer a stroke than those who did not. However, taking a planned nap of less than an hour was not associated with an increased stroke risk, the study said. It's important to note that the research could only show an association between sleep problems and stroke, not causation, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""The question remains: Is poor quality sleep causative? Or is it simply associated with a cluster of bad health habits that would lead somebody to have a higher stroke risk?"" asked Freeman, who was not involved in the research. ""Are they under a lot of stress? Are they drinking huge amounts of caffeine and then not sleeping?  Maybe they're not exercising very much, and we know that exercise promotes good quality sleep,"" Freeman said. ""It's hard to tease out all the factors that might contribute."" What to do Practicing good sleep hygiene, eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise are all key ways to reduce the negative impact of sleep disorders and reduce stroke and cardiovascular risk, Freeman said. ""What I always tell people is, you know, getting about seven hours a night of uninterrupted sleep is associated with the least amount of cardiovascular disease,"" he said. It's important to prioritize getting those seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night on a regular basis, Zee said. Doing so means going to bed and waking at the same time every day, even on weekends. ""Regular exposure to light in the morning and afternoon can also improve sleep quality,"" she said, adding that anyone suffering from snoring, insomnia or excessive sleepiness during the day should talk to a sleep specialist. The bedroom should be used for sleeping and intimacy only, Freeman added.  ""Don't hang out in there and watch TV or read books or do work in there,"" he said. ""Keep a notebook next to the bed so if you wake up in the middle of the night you can write down what comes to mind. Diffuse any worries you have by meditating on it and do your best to let things go."" Don't drink alcohol or eat at least three hours before bed to avoid gastric distress that might wake you up, Zee suggested.  ""It's also important to exercise, preferably in the morning,"" Freeman added. ""The one true medicine that works always is improving one's lifestyle to include healthy behaviors.""

                      A record number of people are dying from firearm injuries in the US, and new research suggests that shootings are becoming more lethal, too. Most victims of fatal firearm injuries die at the scene of the shooting, before they can be treated in a health care setting. But that has become increasingly common over the past two decades.  About 57% of firearm fatalities in 2021 occurred at the scene of the shooting, up 9% since 1999, according to a research letter published Wednesday in the JAMA Surgery journal. For this analysis, researchers used data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and excluded suicides and other self-inflicted firearm injuries.  Nearly 49,000 people died from firearm injuries in the US in 2021, CDC data shows -- an unprecedented surge of about 23% over two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. And a shift in the type of firearms that are being bought and used is a key factor making shootings more lethal, experts say. ""It's leaning more and more towards military-grade, higher velocity, higher lethality type of weapons,"" said Dr. Eric Fleegler, an emergency physician at Boston Children's Hospital.  ""That includes larger magazine capacity so they can shoot more bullets, the ability to fire them at faster rates, and quite frankly, just bigger, faster bullets which cause more damage to a human body.""  Federal data shows that handguns are the most common murder weapon, used in more than half of all homicides that involve firearms. But rifles, such as the AR-15, are becoming more frequently used.  Nearly 4% of firearm homicides in 2021 involved a rifle, killing 447 people, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That's more than twice as many deaths and nearly twice as common compared to firearm homicides in 2015. Other external factors could also play a role in the location where a victim dies, such as increasing demand for ambulances that could affect emergency transportation options. Still, experts say that more -- and better -- data on gun violence is needed.  In the CDC data, for example, definitions to help differentiate location of death were lacking and many were coded as ""other"" or ""unknown."" And the true scope of America's gun epidemic is far broader than the deaths it causes, experts say.  ""Deaths from firearm injuries are horrible tragedies, but they are unfortunately just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Fleegler, who has studied gun violence but was not involved in this research. There are many others who suffer physically from gunshot wounds and a deep emotional toll on families and communities, he said, and more robust data is needed to understand that.  While there are more questions to be answered, experts say that this new research adds to evidence that an important step to reducing gun violence will involve addressing the types of guns that are available. ""It reiterates that maybe there should be a look at solutions which limit the magazine capacity and access to high-caliber weapons, as well,"" said Ari Davis, a policy advisor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

                      The US National Institute on Aging is moving forward with efforts to build a real-world Alzheimer's disease database as part of its aim to improve, support and conduct more dementia research. Last month, the agency, part of the National Institutes of Health, posted a notice of the grant for the six-year database project, setting its earliest start date as April 2024.  The NIH confirmed Tuesday that plans are underway to fund the Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias' real-world data platform. The National Institute on Aging intends to commit $50 million per year, starting in fiscal year 2024, to fund one award.   The nonprofit Alzheimer's Association is among those planning to apply for the grant. ""The newly-announced NIA funding for a large-scale Alzheimer's disease research database is truly exciting and a very important step forward for our field, and the Alzheimer's Association will apply for that grant,"" Maria C. Carrillo, Alzheimer's Association chief science officer, said in an email Tuesday. ""The Association is already leading ALZ-NET, which is a national network of physicians that is collecting data -- including measures of cognition, function and safety -- for patients treated with new FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments,"" Carrillo said. ""The NIA funding could expand ALZ-NET's scope to the benefit of all stakeholders."" She added that the Alzheimer's Association believes everyone should have access to treatments, regardless of their registration status. The real-world database ""aims to transform"" the Alzheimer's disease research enterprise ""by serving as a central hub of research access,"" the National Institute on Aging said last week in its announcement of a webinar about the project that's scheduled for April 19.  According to the announcement, the aim of the data registry is to provide a comprehensive and diverse database that can ""improve applicability and generalizability of findings,"" be used as a tool for researchers and allow scientific questions to be answered more quickly.   Last year, the National Institute on Aging convened an exploratory workshop to discuss gaps in real-world data and opportunities to expand real-world data sources for dementia research.  Alzheimer's disease, a brain disorder that affect memory and thinking skills, is the most common type of dementia, the NIH says. More than 6 million Americans are living with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Association, and the number of people affected is projected to double in the next two decades, rising to 13 million in 2050.

                      Alzheimer's and HRT: Study suggests sweet spot to avoid dementia

                      Alzheimer's disease strikes women harder than men — over two-thirds of those who descend into dementia's devastating twilight are female at birth. That's likely due to biological reasons that remain poorly understood, according to the Alzheimer's Association. One key piece of the enigma: Women lose sexual hormones such as estrogen when they undergo menopause, either naturally through the body's decreased production or by removal of the ovaries via surgery. However, just how the loss of those hormones and the impact of hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, affects dementia risk is also unclear. A new study may have uncovered a piece or two of the puzzle. Women who underwent early (age 40 to 45) or premature (before age 40) menopause or women who began hormone replacement therapy more than five years after menopause had higher levels of tau in their brains, according to the study published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology. Tau tangles, along with plaques made up of beta-amyloid proteins, are hallmark signs of Alzheimer's disease. ""This is the first study showing a delayed use of hormone therapy seems to be associated with increased levels of Alzheimer's disease markers in the brain,"" said lead author Gillian Coughlan, a research fellow in neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  However, these changes only occurred in women who already had higher levels of beta-amyloid in their brain tissue, Coughlan told CNN. ""Most of the associations we saw between menopause and tau protein occurred in the context of high amyloid,"" Coughlan said. ""Now a large portion of the older population do accumulate amyloid as they get older — it's not that uncommon."" Tau deposits, however, are more uncommon, she said, adding that it takes both tau tangles and beta-amyloid to develop Alzheimer's disease. ""Usually if you've a combination of beta-amyloid and tau, then you would typically develop cognitive decline within a few years,"" Coughlan said.  ""What we found is women who have early menopause or have a very late use of hormone therapy might be at higher risk, but only if they were already on the Alzheimer's disease continuum, with elevated levels of amyloid,"" she said. ""Women with very low levels of amyloid and early menopause did not have such an association."" The study also found that women who began hormone therapy ""at the right time, proximal to menopause age, didn't have higher or lower tau proteins in the brain,"" Coughlan said. ""This is good as it means we may still be able to use hormone therapy to treat severe menopausal symptoms."" Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer's preventive neurologist at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, considered the scientific paper important. ""While it's not the first time a study has shown that early treatment with hormone replacement therapy may be more protective for a women's brain, it did suggest for the first time that greater amounts of tau protein may be associated with later initiation of hormone treatment,"" said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. ""This study doesn't show that hormone therapy causes Alzheimer's. The researchers didn't look at whether the participants went on to develop symptoms of dementia and we can't be sure of cause and effect in this kind of research,"" said Sara Imarisio, head of strategic initiatives at Alzheimer's Research UK, in a statement.  ""Hormone therapy provides important benefits to many women, helping to combat the symptoms that menopause can bring,"" said Imarisio, who was not involved in the study. ""Women who take, or are thinking of taking, hormone therapy should not be put off by these results, and anyone concerned about the effects of this treatment should speak to their doctor."" Hormone replacement therapy The average age of menopause onset — defined as when a woman hasn't had a period for 12 months in a row — is 51, although women can naturally go into menopause between the ages of 40 and 58, according to the North American Menopause Society. Symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats can occur years in advance, in what is called perimenopause.  Hormone replacement therapy has been a loaded topic for many women since early, misguided results were published in 2002 from a study called the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial. That preliminary analysis found an estrogen and progestin combo — the type of HRT prescribed at the time — increased the risk of heart disease as well as stroke, blood clots, dementia and breast cancer. The study was halted early due to the dangers. Fallout was dramatic. By the end of the year, hormone therapy use dropped 30% when analyzed by insurance claims. By 2009, hormone therapy claims had dropped more than 70%. Ten years later, the Women's Health Initiative findings were debunked. Because the original analysis looked at women age 65 and older, who were already at greater risk for heart attacks, blood clots and stroke, the initial 2002 results were flawed because they failed to consider a woman's age at the start of replacement therapy. But the damage was done. Even today, many doctors are uncomfortable prescribing the use of hormone therapy, leaving many women to suffer through devastating symptoms without recourse.  Current medical guidelines suggest the benefits of hormone therapy for hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal pain and dryness, urinary issues, and bone loss outweigh the risks for women younger than 60 who are within 10 years of the onset of menopause — and who have no known or suspected history of breast cancer, blood clots, stroke or other contraindications.  It's a different story for women who are older than 60 or who start hormone therapy more than 10 years after the onset of menopause. ""The benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia,"" according to the 2022 hormone therapy position statement of The North American Menopause Society. What brain scans show In the new JAMA Neurology study, a team of researchers from Boston-based Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital analyzed brain scans of 193 women and 99 men with normal cognitive function for beta-amyloid and tau pathology.  That may sound like a small study, but it isn't, Coughlan said: ""When using brain scans to actually look at disease in the brain, this is considered a large sample size."" The study found women had more tau buildup in several parts of the brain than men of a similar age, said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. She wasn't involved in the study. ""Further, females had higher tau burden than males when they also have amyloid pathology in the brain,"" Spires-Jones said in a statement. Women in the new study all used the type of hormone therapy — the estrogen and progestin mix — that was used by the women in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial that caused so much controversy, Coughlan said. ""If (our study) is replicated, we may have found a potential biological basis for the results of the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial, which found women 65 and above were more likely to develop dementia later in life if they took that one type of hormone therapy,"" she said. However, today women have many other options for hormone replacement, depending on their individual needs. The study had some limitations — most participants were White and the study did not say who then went on to develop dementia, experts said. In addition, there were not enough people in the study with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's, said Dr. Liz Coulthard, an associate professor in dementia neurology at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the study. ""Recently we found out that HRT might have different effects in people at high genetic risk (apoE4 gene positive), but this is not featured here,"" Coulthard said in a statement. ""The results here are scientifically interesting,"" she added. ""But research into the relationship between HRT, menopause and Alzheimer's is beset by multiple small studies, all confounded by the different reasons people are prescribed HRT and accuracy of memory for menopause age and HRT use. ""As a result, women are receiving conflicting or poorly justified advice as to whether HRT use may be helpful or not for future brain health,"" Coulthard said. ""A balanced, well-powered trial of HRT over many years is the only way we will really understand whether HRT is harmful to brain health.""

                      How to tell when stress is a problem Our medical expert explains
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/health/stress-mental-health-wellness/index.html,"

                      As we mark Stress Awareness Month in April, I know there's so much to be stressed out—mass shootings, wars around the world, the pandemic's long-term effects and the daily stresses of living and working in the 21st century. I'm sure you've got your list. Everyone experiences stress at different points in their life. But when is stress a problem that requires our attention? What symptoms should people be on the lookout for? What are the health impacts of long-term stress? What are healthy and unhealthy coping mechanisms? And what techniques can help in addressing—and preventing—stress? Fresh from dropping off my kid at school late (sorry, kid, my fault), I was looking forward to this advice from CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She previously served as Baltimore's Health Commissioner and as Chair of Behavioral Health Systems Baltimore.   CNN: Let's start with the basics. What exactly is stress? Dr. Leana Wen: There is no single definition of stress. The World Health Organization's definition refers to a state of worry or tension caused by a difficult situation. Many people experience stress as mental or emotional strain. Others also have physical manifestations of stress. Stress is a natural reaction. It's a human response that prompts us to respond to challenges and perceived threats. Some stress can be healthy and can prompt us to fulfill obligations. Perceived stress can spur us to study for a test or complete a project by a certain deadline. Virtually everyone experiences that kind of stress to some extent.   CNN: Why can stress be a problem? Wen: The same human response that motivates us to work hard and finish a project can also lead to other emotions, like not being able to relax and becoming irritable and anxious. Some people develop physical reactions, like headaches, upset stomach and trouble sleeping. Longer-term stress can lead to anxiety and depression, and it can worsen symptoms for people with pre-existing behavioral health conditions, including substance use.   CNN: What are symptoms of stress that people should be on the lookout for?  Wen: In addition to feeling irritable and anxious, people experiencing stress can also feel nervous, uncertain and angry. They often express other symptoms, including feeling a lack of motivation; having trouble concentrating; and being tired, overwhelmed and burnt out. Many times, people in stressful situations will report being sad or depressed.   It's important to note that depression and anxiety are separate medical diagnoses. Someone with depression and/or anxiety could have their symptoms exacerbated when they are undergoing times in their life with added stress. Long-term stress can also lead to depression and anxiety.   One way to think about the difference between stress versus anxiety and depression is that stress is generally a response to an external issue. The external cause could be good and motivating, like the need to finish a project. It could also be a negative emotional stress, like an argument with a romantic partner, concerns about financial stability or a challenging situation at work. Stress should go away when the situation is resolved.   Anxiety and depression, on the other hand, are generally persistent. Even after a stressful external event has passed, these internal feelings of apprehension, unworthiness and sadness are still there and interfere with your ability to live and enjoy your life.   CNN: What are the health impacts of long-term stress? Wen: Chronic stress can have long-term consequences. Studies have shown that it can raise the risk of heart disease and stroke. It's associated with worse immune response and decreased cognitive function.   Individuals experiencing stress are also more likely to endorse unhealthy behaviors, like smoking, excessive drinking, substance use, lack of sleep and physical inactivity. These lifestyle factors in turn can lead to worse health outcomes.   CNN: What techniques can help in addressing stress? Wen: First, awareness is important. Know your own body and your reaction to stress. Sometimes, anticipating that a situation may be stressful and being prepared to deal with it can reduce stress and anxiety.   Second, identifying symptoms can help. For example, if you know that your stress reaction includes feeling your heart rate increase and getting agitated, then you can detect the symptoms as they occur and become aware of the stressful situation as it's occurring. Third, know what stress relief techniques work for you. Some people are big fans of mindfulness meditation. Those, and deep breathing exercises, are good for everyone to try.   For me, nothing beats stress relief like exercise. For me, what helps is exercising, in particular swimming. Aerobic exercise is associated with stress relief, and mixing it up with high-intensity regimens can help, too.   A lot of people have other specific techniques that help them. Some people clean their house, organize their closets or work in their gardens. Others spend time walking in nature, writing in a journal, knitting, playing with their pets or cycling.   I'd advise that you experiment with what works, take stock of existing techniques that help you and incorporate some of those practices into your regular routine. Then, in times of stress, they are good tools to turn to that you know will help you.    CNN: What unhealthy copings strategies should people avoid? Wen: Definitely. There are things people turn to in an effort to make themselves feel better in the short-term that can actually make things worse. Excessive alcohol intake, using drugs and smoking aren't healthy coping strategies. It's the same with staying up all night, binge-eating and taking out your frustration on loved ones. These have wide-ranging consequences, and you should reconsider them if they have been your go-to coping mechanisms in the past.   CNN: When is it time to seek help? Wen: If the stress you are feeling is consistently interfering with your work, social or personal life or if you are experiencing signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders, it's time to seek help. Consider speaking with your primary care physician to get a referral to a therapist. Your workplace may have an Employee Assistance Program that you can turn to, too. And the federal mental health crisis hotline number, 988, is another resource.  This April, for Stress Awareness Month, I hope we can all assess our own stress levels as well as our reaction to stress. We should recognize what helps us to reduce and alleviate stress as we aim to improve our physical and emotional well-being.

                      The manufacturer of eye drops that have been linked to an outbreak of serious bacterial infections in the US, including at least three deaths, did not follow proper protocol to prevent contamination of its products, according to an inspection report published Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA visited a Global Pharma Healthcare facility in India for an inspection that started in mid-February, 2½ weeks after the company recalled EzriCare Artificial Tears due to possible contamination.  At the time of the recall, there were 55 reports of adverse events including eye infections, permanent loss of vision and at least one death with a bloodstream infection. As of late last month, 68 infections had been identified in 16 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been three deaths, eight cases of vision loss and four surgical eye removals reported. An 11-day inspection of the Global Pharma facility resulted in 11 observations by the FDA, including a ""manufacturing process that lacked assurance of product sterility,"" specifically for batches of product that were manufactured between December 2020 and April 2022 and shipped to the US. The EzriCare Artificial Tears product, which is manufactured by Global Pharma, is part of an outbreak of infections from bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa.   This rare drug-resistant bacteria can spread among people who don't have symptoms -- and to people who haven't used the eye drops, according to the CDC. This type of spread is particularly common in health care settings.  ""The bacteria can spread when one patient carrying the bacteria exposes another patient, or when patients touch common items or when healthcare workers transmit the germs which is why infection control, like hand hygiene, is so important,"" the agency told CNN in an email Monday. Several cases in the current outbreak have been identified in people who were carrying the bacteria without signs or symptoms of clinical infections, the CDC said. These cases were discovered through screenings at inpatient health care facilities that had clusters of infections. The particular strain of the bacteria associated with this outbreak had never before been reported in the US, and related infections have been identified at acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, emergency departments, urgent care clinics and other outpatient facilities. People affected by the outbreak reported using different brands of artificial tears, but EzriCare Artificial Tears was most commonly reported. The FDA inspection of the Global Pharma facility is part of an ongoing compliance matter. ""The FDA's highest priority is protecting public health -- this includes working with manufacturers to quickly remove unsafe drugs from shelves when they are identified,"" the agency said in an email Monday. ""The FDA continues to monitor this issue and is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the companies recalling these affected products. We urge consumers to stop using these products which may be harmful to their health.""

                      Bad sleep quality and quantity may put you at greater risk for developing asthma, according to a new study. Previous research has already shown that asthma tends to lead to sleep issues, but researchers wanted to know if the association worked the other way — that is, whether how someone slept impacted their likelihood of developing asthma, said the study, which published Monday in the journal BMJ Open Respiratory Research.  ""We've always known that there is some association between asthma and sleep but most of the work had been done on the presence of obstructive sleep apnea,"" said pediatric allergist Dr. Amal Assa'ad, associate director of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. She was not involved in the latest study. To investigate, researchers looked at the data of a cohort from 2006 to 2010 with more than 450,000 people in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that is following residents long-term. The people studied ranged in age from 38 to 73 years old, the report said.  At a 10-year follow-up, nearly 18,000 people in the research were diagnosed with asthma, according to the study. Analysis of the data showed that people with both a genetic predisposition and poor sleep habits were twice as likely to develop asthma than people in a low-risk group. Typically, having a genetic predisposition puts you at a 25% to 30% greater risk of developing asthma, said Dr. Juanita Mora, a Chicago-based allergist/immunologist and national spokesperson for the American Lung Association. She was not involved in the research. There is good news: Healthy sleep patterns were shown to be associated with lower risk of asthma no matter the genetic susceptibility, the study said.  People with high-risk genes and good sleep patterns had slightly lower risk of developing asthma than people who had a low genetic risk and bad sleep patterns, the authors added.  By monitoring and treating sleep conditions, health professionals might also be mitigating the development of asthma, the study authors wrote. If sleep traits were improved, 19% of asthma cases could be prevented, according to the research.  This finding also points to a greater need for doctors and nurses to talk to their patients with asthma about their sleep habits to see if their behavior is worsening symptoms, Mora added.  Better sleep is good for everyone The key to understanding this study is understanding the interplay between genetics and behavior, Assa'ad said.  The researchers looked at all the small changes in DNA that can put someone at greater risk for developing asthma, she added. Those markers and the risk in the genetics become what's called a person's polygenic risk score. But most people don't know their genetic score for how susceptible they are to developing asthma and instead are only aware of how severe their symptoms are, Assa'ad said.  What people can do is track their trigger and exacerbating factors — of which sleep seems to be one of many — to get optimal control over their asthma, Mora said.  The results may underscore the importance of good sleep hygiene for everyone, regardless of their asthma genetics, she added. Inflammation may be behind why sleep is so important to managing or preventing asthma, according to the study.  Asthma is generally considered a chronic inflammatory disease, the study said. Previous research has shown that problems with sleep duration and insomnia are associated with chronic inflammation. Sleep disorders are also associated with chronic activation of the stress response, parts of which are key in the development of asthma, the study said.  Good sleep hygiene Adults need at least seven hours of sleep a night, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For many people, that isn't happening — 1 in 3 Americans have a sleep deficit, according to the CDC.  But it's not just quantity that you should focus on — quality matters, too.  ""Signs of poor sleep quality include not feeling rested even after getting enough sleep, repeatedly waking up during the night, and experiencing symptoms of sleep disorders (such as snoring or gasping for air),"" the CDC said.  That is where good sleep hygiene (or habits) come into play. The CDC recommends going to bed and waking up at the same time consistently, keeping the bedroom comfortable and dark, and avoiding electronics before bed.  A comfortable room typically means one that is cool — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius), according to a 2021 CNN story. A routine to get you ready for sleep isn't just for kids who need a bath and book before bed. Winding down with familiar activities is a great way to signal to brains of all ages that it is time to rest, pediatric sleep expert Ariel Williamson, a psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN earlier this year. You should also avoid large meals, caffeine and alcohol too close to bedtime and get active during the day for better sleep.  If none of those changes improves your sleep, it may be time to see a doctor, experts say.

                      Infertility affects a 'staggering' 1 in 6 people worldwide, WHO says

                      An estimated 1 in 6 people globally are affected by infertility, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, which emphasizes that the condition is common. Rates of infertility -- defined as not being able to conceive after a year of having unprotected sex -- are similar across all countries and regions, Monday's WHO report says. ""In our analysis, the global prevalence of lifetime infertility was 17.5%, translating into 1 out of every 6 people experiencing it in their lifetime,"" Dr. Gitau Mburu, a scientist of fertility research at WHO, said Monday.  ""Lifetime prevalence of infertility does not differ by income classification of countries,"" he said. ""Lifetime prevalence was 17.8% in high-income countries and 16.5% in low- and middle-income countries, which, again, was not a substantial or significant difference."" Yet there are differences in how much people are spending on fertility treatments and how accessible such treatments are, according to the report. ""People in the poorest countries were found to spend a significantly larger proportion of their income on a single cycle of IVF or on fertility care compared with wealthier countries,"" Mburu said, ""exemplifying that this is an area with high-level risk of inequality in access to health care."" Global public health groups typically call attention to overpopulation as a major public health concern, so the spotlight that the WHO report turns on infertility not only is surprising but is welcome, said Dr. David Keefe, reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist at the NYU Langone Fertility Center in New York. ""That report did not surprise me in terms of the content, because it's been known for some time that infertility is much more prevalent than anyone wants to think about: Having a child and having a family is kind of a universal dream or aspiration for people from every country, from every region. What surprised me was the World Health Organization coming out in support of it,"" said Keefe, who was not involved with the WHO research. ""It was a welcome acknowledgment of the other foot dropping on the population front,"" he said. ""The acknowledgment that this is a worldwide problem and that additional attention must be devoted to it in terms of policy and strategy is welcome."" 'This is a worldwide problem' The WHO report -- described as the ""first of its kind in a decade"" -- includes an analysis of infertility data from 1990 through 2021. The data came from 133 previously published studies on infertility prevalence. ""The purpose of this analysis was to generate updated data on the global and regional estimates of infertility prevalence by analyzing all available data from different countries, making sure that we take into account different study approaches,"" Mburu said. Based on that data, the researchers estimate that lifetime prevalence of infertility -- representing the proportion of people who have ever experienced infertility in their reproductive life -- was 17.5% in 2022.  The period prevalence of infertility, meaning the proportion of people with infertility at any given point currently or in the past, was found to be 12.6% in 2022. Although the data showed some variation in infertility prevalence across regions -- with the highest lifetime prevalence at 23.2% in the Western Pacific, compared with the lowest at 10.7% in the Eastern Mediterranean -- those regional differences were not either substantial or conclusive based on the data, according to WHO's report.  The researchers also did not determine whether global infertility rates have been increasing or decreasing over time. ""The data which we analyzed for this report was from 1990 to 2021, and during that period, we did not see evidence of increasing rates of infertility. However, the way the data was arranged, it was not really organized to answer that question,"" Dr. James Kiarie, head of contraception and fertility care at WHO, said Monday. ""We cannot, based on the data we have, say that infertility is increasing or constant -- so we must say that probably the jury is still out on that question."" Over time, various factors can affect a person's fertility, and age is one of the most important, said Dr. Emre Seli, chief scientific officer for the maternal and infant health nonprofit March of Dimes. Seli, who is also a professor at Yale School of Medicine and medical director of Yale Fertility Center, was not involved in the new report.  ""Fertility decreases as the age of the female partner increases,"" he said. ""Fertility is really an emotionally taxing issue for those who are affected by it. It is a major source of stress to want to have a child and not be able to,"" Seli said. ""Most of my patients are women, and they do become affected by this at many levels, and they do suffer from lack of adequate research as well as lack of adequate insurance coverage to undergo the treatments that they need."" 'An important public health concern' Infertility, affecting the male or female reproductive system, can be treated with medicine, surgery or assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization or IVF, during which an egg and sperm are joined in a lab dish and put into a womb once the fertilized egg becomes an embryo.   ""Infertility is a major and a widespread health issue affecting a staggering 1 in 6 people globally over the duration of their reproductive lives,"" Dr. Pascale Allotey, director of the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department at WHO, said Monday. Despite that, solutions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility remain ""underfunded"" and ""inaccessible"" to many patients due to high costs, Allotey said. ""Infertility is an important public health concern because it can have wide-reaching negative impacts on the lives of the people affected,"" she said. ""WHO is calling for universal access to affordable high-quality fertility care, improved data to enable infertility to be meaningfully addressed in health policy and programs, and greater efforts to ensure this issue is no longer sidelined in health research and policy."" Mburu added that infertility can also have effects on mental health, raising risks of anxiety, depression and intimate partner violence. ""Our message is that infertility needs to be included as a priority in responding to the needs of populations in different countries,"" Mburu said. ""This is because people have a right to expect to obtain the highest possible standard of mental, social and physical health as defined by WHO."" The new data from WHO reinforces that more people need fertility coverage and access to high-quality care than was previously thought, said Dr. Asima Ahmad, an endocrinologist and fertility expert who serves as chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a company that helps employers set up fertility benefits. She added that inequities emerge in who has such access to care, such as Black women who tend to experience inequities in access. ""These inequities, I'm not surprised that they exist on a global level, because we already see the inequities in the United States domestically, with how infertility impacts different populations and how some populations have limited access. And even with the access that they finally get, they, for example, will have a lower rate of success or even a higher rate of miscarriage,"" said Ahmad, who was not involved in the new WHO report. ""A lot of people don't have access to clinically vetted evidence-based information around what causes infertility, how to recognize it, and then when you do find out that you have it, how to treat it,"" she said. ""The other, which is one of the biggest barriers that we see, is financial access to fertility. In the United States, a lot of that access comes through the employer providing, for example, fertility benefits, but on a global level, that's not necessarily the case, and finances tends to be the biggest barrier.""

                      A new approach to a Covid-19 nasal vaccine shows early promise
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/03/health/nasal-vaccine-sterilizing-immunity/index.html,"
                      Apr 03, 2023
                    ","
                      Scientists in Germany say they've been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where the virus gets its first foothold in the body. In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine -- which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 -- blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals' upper airways, achieving ""sterilizing immunity"" and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic. Although this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor's office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.  China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it's not clear how well they may be working.  Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people. Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccines The US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.   As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there's always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself.  And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.   Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat. One way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.    It's a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.   The immunity that's created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response. ""If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they're like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,"" Wyler said. Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do.  They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have.  Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants. The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it's no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies.  Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.   The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick. ""You could imagine reading a text ... and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,"" Wyler said. Promising results in animal studies In the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells. The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.   The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a wider range of targets. As promising as all this sounds, vaccine experts say caution is warranted.  This vaccine still has to pass more tests before it's ready for use, but they say the results look encouraging. ""They did a very nice job. This is obviously a competent and thoughtful team that did this work, and impressive in the scope of what they did. Now it just needs to be repeated,"" perhaps in primates and certainly in humans before it can be widely used, said Dr. Greg Poland, who designs vaccines at the Mayo Clinic. He was not involved in the new research. The study began in 2021, before the Omicron variant was around, so the vaccine tested in these experiments was made with the original strain of the coronavirus.  In the experiments, when they infected animals with Omicron, the live but weakened nasal vaccine still performed better than the others, but its ability to neutralize the virus was diminished.  Researchers think it will need an update. It also needs to be tested in humans, and Wyler says they're working on that.  The scientists have partnered with a Swiss company called RocketVax to start phase I clinical trials. Other vaccines are further along, but the progress has been ""slow and halting,"" Poland said.  Groups working on these vaccines are struggling to raise the steep costs of getting a new vaccine to market, and they're doing it in a setting where people tend to think the vaccine race has been won and done.   In reality, Poland said, we're far from that.  All it would take is another Omicron-level shift in the evolution of the virus, and we could be back at square one, with no effective tools against the coronavirus. ""That's foolish. We should be developing a pan-coronavirus vaccine that does induce mucosal immunity and that is long-lived,"" he said. More on the way At least four nasal vaccines for Covid-19 have reached late-stage testing in people, according to the World Health Organization's vaccine tracker.   The nasal vaccines in use in China and India rely on harmless adenoviruses to ferry their instructions into cells, although effectiveness data for these has not been published. Two other nasal vaccines are finishing human studies.   One, a recombinant vaccine that can be produced cheaply in chicken eggs, the same way many flu vaccines are, is being put through its paces by researchers at Mount Sinai in New York City. Another, like the German vaccine, uses a live but weakened version of the virus.  It's being developed by a company called Codagenix.  Results of those studies, which were carried out in South America and Africa, may come later this year. The German team says it's eagerly watching for the Codagenix data. ""They will be very important in order to know where whether this kind of attempt is basically promising or not,"" Wyler said. They have reason to worry.  Respiratory infections have proved to be tough targets for inhaled vaccines. FluMist, a live but weakened form of the flu virus, works reasonably well in children but doesn't help adults as much. The reason is thought to be that adults already have immune memory for the flu, and when the virus is injected into the nose, the vaccine mostly boosts what's already there. Still, some of the most potent vaccines such as the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella use live attenuated viruses, so it's a promising approach. Another consideration is that live vaccines can't be taken by everyone.  People with very compromised immunity are often cautioned against using live vaccines because even these very weakened viruses may be risky for them. ""Although it's strongly attenuated, it's still a real virus,"" Wyler said, so it would have to be used carefully.

                      Study finds slightly higher risk of autism diagnosis in areas with more lithium in drinking water, but experts say more research is needed

                      A new study found a moderately higher risk of autism spectrum disorder in children born to pregnant people exposed to tap water with higher levels of lithium, but experts caution that this association does not show a direct link between the two. About 1 in 36 children in the US is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) each year, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists still don't know the exact cause of autism, a developmental disorder. Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too. Cases may be on the rise, but that is also unclear. One study published this year on cases in the New York-New Jersey area found that autism diagnosis rates tripled among certain age groups between 2000 and 2016. A 2021 report found similar increases in cases, but the CDC says the increased number of cases is most likely linked to more doctors screening for the condition. Lithium is an alkali metal that can be found naturally in some food and ground water. It's used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated, according to the US Geological Survey.  A new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems. The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation. As lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASD diagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure. The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe. Experts say it's important to note that the research can't show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis. Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. ""Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,"" Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection. The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked with health benefits such as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide. ""If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,"" wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. ""Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders. Those studies -- which look at people exposed to much higher levels than are found in drinking water -- do not show a connection with autism spectrum disorder. ""It's an interesting association, but causation is definitely not proven,"" said Wiznitzer, who was not involved in the new research. ""We have to see if there's a viable and biologically plausible mechanism by which a small amount of lithium in the water supply can somehow do this, yet pharmacologic dosing of lithium in women with bipolar disorder has not been reported to be causing increased risk of ASD."" Other studies have also suggested connections between ASD and environmental exposures to things like pesticides, air pollution and phthalates. But none of them points to any of these factors as a direct cause of the disorder. A link between environmental exposure and ASD is hard to prove, Wiznitzer said. With research showing that increased exposure to air pollution raises the risk of giving birth to a child with ASD, for example, he often wonders whether pollution is the determining factor or if it's just the populations who live in more polluted areas. ""There's a lot of speculation about about environmental factors, but how many of them are truly causally associated?"" Wiznitzer said. ""We are bombarded with a variety of environmental stressors in our everyday lives. We have to figure out how to basically safely navigate them, and this is probably not one that's high on our list.""

                      One iguana's taste for cake leaves a young girl with a mysterious malady

                      The bump on a young California girl's hand was mysterious -- and growing. It wasn't until she had seen two doctors and undergone a biopsy that her family realized the cause: The child had gotten in the way of a hungry iguana with a sweet tooth, resulting in what may be the first documented infection of a rare bacterial infection in a human from an iguana bite. The girl, Lena Mars, is featured in a scientific presentation on the case that will be given at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in April. She is still recovering at her family's home in San Jose, California after the unexpected ordeal, which started on a vacation in March 2022. Mars and her parents, Julian and Luisa, had taken a trip to Costa Rica. While enjoying one of the country's many beautiful beaches, the girl's parents gave her a snack. But it turns out that she wasn't the only one who was hungry: A wild iguana popped up as the girl ate her cake by the water. Iguanas are common in Costa Rica. They're harmless herbivores, known mostly for sunning themselves under trees and eating fruits and leaves, but experts say this animal must have developed a sweet tooth. The iguana ran up to the girl and bit her on the back of her left middle finger, causing her to loosen her grip on the cake. The reptile then ran off with the snack, but it did leave something else behind. Dr. Jordan Mah, an author of the presentation and an expert in medical microbiology, worked on the lab testing for the case as a part of the Department of Pathology at Stanford University. Mah said the girl's parents probably weren't thinking about the bite when they took her to a doctor because of the bump on her hand. ""I think when they went to get medical attention for the bump initially, the bite kind of slipped their mind because they didn't see it as a potential exposure, because it just healed. And it was only later on during the course of treatment, as it got worse, that it kind of jogged their memory and they brought it to the doctor's attention,"" he said. Mah says the Mars had been immediately responsive after the iguana encounter. The wound looked superficial, but they took the girl to a local clinic, where staffers disinfected the wound with alcohol and gave her five days worth of antibiotics. The wound appeared to have cleared up in about two weeks. It was only five months later, when her parents noticed a dime-size bump on the girl's hand in the same spot, that they thought they should take her to another doctor. The girl told them it didn't hurt, and there were no other symptoms. Her pediatrician thought the bump might be a harmless cyst and told her parents to keep an eye it. But when the bump continued to grow and began causing mild pain, her parents took the girl to an orthopedist, who suggested a biopsy. In November, the doctor removed the 2-centimeter mass. Scientists took a closer look at the growth in the lab and discovered that the child had a rare infection with Mycobacterium marinum, a non-tuberculous mycobacterium that more commonly causes a tuberculosis-like illness in fish. It's ubiquitous in fresh and salt water but rarely infects humans. Typically, when humans are infected, it's after a wound has been exposed to the bacteria in water. Most people who get these infections develop a rash that may spread in a spherical pattern. It may develop a nodule with pus or turn into an ulcer. Most antibiotics alone don't typically work on these kinds of infections, so doctors started the girl on rifampin, an antimicrobial, and clarithromycin, an antibiotic often used for skin infections. The infection responded well to the treatment. ""Typically, with these infections, because they take a very long time to grow and they're a little bit more fastidious, you need to treat them for a longer period of time, sometimes several months,"" Mah said. ""So she's doing better. I wouldn't say 100%, but she's doing a lot better than she was initially."" Mah believes this is the first time a human has gotten this kind of infection from an iguana bite. He wanted to present the case to warn clinicians of the possibility.  Growing M. marinum in the lab required a lower temperature than most bacteria. This particular bacteria likes to grow at about 82 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit.  Most bacteria are cultured around 95 to 98.6 degrees, so the diagnostics were slightly different. With lizards and iguanas having lower body temperatures than humans, Mah said, they may be the perfect hosts for this kind of bacteria. ""There is we know a lot about animal bites and bacteria, infections, following, let's say, dogs or cats, but there really isn't much for lizards, let alone iguana,"" he said. ""I don't think people should be afraid, but doctors should be aware of the possibility."" Iguanas that were native to South and Central America and Mexico have become an invasive species in South Florida, Hawaii, Texas and Puerto Rico, so people may have more encounters with them. But experts who work with iguanas say they are usually pretty harmless, so there is no reason to be afraid of them. Anna Meyer, operations manager at Iguanaland, Florida's largest reptile zoo, said the behavior of the one in this case is not typical. ""Typically, they will go about their day and not want to bother anyone or be bothered by anyone. But like any wildlife, if they start associating people with food, they're going to risk coming closer,"" Meyer said. In this case, other tourists in Costa Rica might have fed the wild iguana until it became habituated to people and developed certain expectations of them. ""That's an animal who's just become accustomed to people providing it with food,"" Meyer said. It probably realized it could get a ""higher-value food"" from the toddler without much danger to itself. The lesson here, she said, is that no one should feed wildlife, because it makes the animal think that stealing food from a child is, well, like taking candy from a baby. ""There's more calories in cake than in a mango or leaves,"" she said. The Mars family said their daughter is still recovering from her wound, and they praised her for the spirit with which she has handled the whole experience. ""Our daughter, Lena, just celebrated her 4th birthday and is still recovering from the surgery in November. The wound is just closing, and the whole healing process has taken more strength than the bite itself,"" the family said in a statement. ""Lena is the bravest child we can imagine, and she is handling the situation pretty well. She definitely remembers the bite and knows that the bacteria came from the iguana. She will probably never forget the experience, but we hope that someday we can all laugh about what happened.""

                      There is something exciting about a walk with my dog down my street — even though everything we see and do along the way is entirely predictable. I know we will wave hello to my retired neighbor tending his garden. We will pass teens at the basketball courts and younger kids on the playground. I know members of the church congregation are going to have their Saturday cookout. I know my dog Milo will start pulling when he sees the grocer at the end of the street and realizes a treat is coming any minute.  Predictable as they are, these environments and interactions that make up my neighborhood help make my community livable.  A livable community is one that is set up so that residents of any age can thrive, said Mike Watson, the director of livable communities at AARP. That way, a family can build a life with young children and then continue to feel invested in their community after retirement.  But those types of communities are not accessible to everyone everywhere, he added.  That is why the nonprofit Trust for America's Health and the AARP are working with communities all over the United States. The goal is to make them more ""safe and accessible and equitable to all racial ethnic groups and backgrounds,"" said Karon Phillips, policy development manager at the trust. Previous research has shown that social connections and community are key to a long life span and good health outcomes, while lack of social connections and unhappiness can reduce life expectancy. A livable community might be an important piece of living longer and better lives, Watson said.  What makes a livable community What makes a place livable depends on the needs of that particular neighborhood, but there are some common factors.  The four basic pillars of health are nutrition, physical activity, sleep and behavior (meaning stress, coping, connection and support), according to Johns Hopkins Children's Hospital. And many of the things needed in a livable community support those pillars. It's important that communities have various methods of transportation, Watson said. Safe roads are important, but so are navigable sidewalks and public transportation for residents who don't drive. Similarly, various forms of affordable housing help keep people living in the communities they love. In addition to single family homes, apartments and accessory dwelling units (an additional apartment or small home on the same lot as a single-family home) provide options for people with constraints or who need access to care from their loved ones, Phillips said.  Ways to access nutritious food and quality health care easily — with or without a car — also ensures that people can live well in their community, she added. And another critical factor is how effectively a place promotes social connection, Phillips said. Are there parks that various generations can frequent? Are there community centers or libraries? Are faith communities available? Are there systems or a culture in place so that people check up on one another?  Many resources are primarily available online, so high-speed internet broadband is also a resource that makes a neighborhood more accessible, Watson said. Though there may be retirement communities that aim to provide those needs to older residents, not everyone wants to leave their community when their needs change, he said.   ""What I've heard from my patients and what we see in terms of people's outcomes, the more that you can be integrated in the community where you live and work the better for your mood,"" said Dr. Mirnova Ceïde, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, New York.  ""People who are isolated or put into a different community, they can get really depressed,"" she added. How everyone benefits Whatever stage of life you are in, investing in a community that works for everyone is always a good idea, Phillips said.  If all goes well, today's 20-year-old will one day become a 60-year-old, so planning for a neighborhood that works long into the future benefits everyone, Watson said. ""Millennials are a larger generation and so are projected to live longer lives,"" he added. ""This country is aging."" But younger generations don't have to wait long to see the investment pay off, Watson said.  The same parks and libraries that bring social connection to older adults are also important resources for kids and young families, he said. A safe sidewalk and crosswalks are important for people using wheelchairs, people on crutches and families with strollers, too. And everyone has a lot to gain from living with multiple generations, whether that is learning about iPads or the roots of a community, said Dr. Joyce Balls-Berry, an associate professor of neurology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""There's so much wealth that can be learned from our elders,"" Balls-Berry said. ""And there's even things that our seniors are learning from the generations that would be considered their grandchildren and great grandchildren."" How to make it happen Because many of the things that make communities livable rely on the built environment — such as parks, housing and grocery availability — much of the progress is going to have to come from local governments and organizations, Phillips said. ""Look at who needs to partner,"" Phillips said. ""There has to be a champion at the table that's going to push for this."" But that doesn't mean there is nothing you as an individual can do to invest in making your community more livable today, Watson said. In addition to pressing local government to make the changes you care about, you can do what other volunteer groups have had success doing: going around their neighborhoods and documenting parts that may be unsafe or inaccessible, he added. Pictures of cracks in sidewalks or curbs that might not be clear to someone with vision impairment can motivate lawmakers to distribute funding at levels that meet the community's needs, Watson said.  And the relationships you build in your community can make strides toward it being more livable, Ceïde said.  You don't have to assume your older neighbors are unable to do things on their own and just offer them your help. Ask your neighbors about themselves and their stories to form real connections, Ceïde added.  ""People like being able to engage with somebody at a human level, and letting them know that they are meaningful and they have something to provide can make a big difference in the quality of life of people,"" she said.

                      Laughter is therapy for the mind and body

                      Amusement and pleasant surprises — and the laughter they can trigger — add texture to the fabric of daily life. Those giggles and guffaws can seem like just silly throwaways. But laughter, in response to funny events, actually takes a lot of work, because it activates many areas of the brain: ones that control motor, emotional, cognitive and social processing. As I found when writing ""An Introduction to the Psychology of Humor,"" researchers now appreciate laughter's power to enhance physical and mental well-being. Laughter's physical power People begin laughing in infancy, when it helps develop muscles and upper body strength. Laughter is not just breathing. It relies on complex combinations of facial muscles, often involving movement of the eyes, head and shoulders. Laughter — doing it or observing it — activates multiple regions of the brain: the motor cortex, which controls muscles; the frontal lobe, which helps you understand context; and the limbic system, which modulates positive emotions. Turning all these circuits on strengthens neural connections and helps a healthy brain coordinate its activity. By activating the neural pathways of emotions such as joy and mirth, laughter can improve your mood and make your physical and emotional response to stress less intense. For example, laughing may help control brain levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, similar to what antidepressants do. By minimizing your brain's responses to threats, it limits the release of neurotransmitters and hormones such as cortisol that can wear down your cardiovascular, metabolic and immune systems over time. Laughter's kind of like an antidote to stress, which weakens these systems and increases vulnerability to diseases. READ MORE: Was that joke funny or offensive? Who's telling it matters Laughter's cognitive power A good sense of humor and the laughter that follows depend on an ample measure of social intelligence and working memory resources. Laughter, like humor, typically sparks from recognizing the incongruities or absurdities of a situation. You need to mentally resolve the surprising behavior or event — otherwise you won't laugh; you might just be confused instead. Inferring the intentions of others and taking their perspective can enhance the intensity of the laughter and amusement you feel. To ""get"" a joke or humorous situation, you need to be able to see the lighter side of things. You must believe that other possibilities besides the literal exist — think about being amused by comic strips with talking animals, such as those found in ""The Far Side."" READ MORE: Joy is good for your body and your mind — three ways to feel it more often  Laughter's social power Many cognitive and social skills work together to help you monitor when and why laughter occurs during conversations. You don't even need to hear a laugh to be able to laugh. Deaf signers punctuate their signed sentences with laughter, much like emoticons in written text. Laughter creates bonds and increases intimacy with others. Linguist Don Nilsen points out that chuckles and belly laughs seldom happen when alone, supporting their strong social role. Beginning early in life, infants' laughter is an external sign of pleasure that helps strengthen bonds with caregivers. Later, it's an external sign of sharing an appreciation of the situation. For example, public speakers and comedians try to get a laugh to make audiences feel psychologically closer to them, to create intimacy. By practicing a little laughter each day, you can enhance social skills that may not come naturally to you. When you laugh in response to humor, you share your feelings with others and learn from risks that your response will be accepted/shared/enjoyed by others and not be rejected/ignored/disliked. In studies, psychologists have found that men with Type A personality characteristics, including competitiveness and time urgency, tend to laugh more, while women with those traits laugh less. Both sexes laugh more with others than when alone. READ MORE: Lucky girl syndrome: the potential dark side of TikTok's extreme positive thinking trend Laughter's mental power Positive psychology researchers study how people can live meaningful lives and thrive. Laughter produces positive emotions that lead to this kind of flourishing. These feelings — such as amusement, happiness, mirth and joy — build resiliency and increase creative thinking. They increase subjective well-being and life satisfaction. Researchers find that these positive emotions experienced with humor and laughter correlate with appreciating the meaning of life and help older adults hold a benign view of difficulties they've faced over a lifetime. Laughter in response to amusement is a healthy coping mechanism. When you laugh, you take yourself or the situation less seriously and may feel empowered to problem-solve. For example, psychologists measured the frequency and intensity of 41 people's laughter over two weeks, along with their ratings of physical and mental stress. They found that the more laughter experienced, the lower the reported stress. Whether the instances of laughter were strong, medium or weak in intensity didn't matter. Maybe you want to grab some of these benefits for yourself — can you force laughter to work for you? A growing number of therapists advocate using humor and laughter to help clients build trust and improve work environments; a review of five different studies found that measures of well-being did increase after laughter interventions. Sometimes called homeplay instead of homework, these interventions take the form of daily humor activities — surrounding yourself with funny people, watching a comedy that makes you laugh or writing down three funny things that happened today. You can practice laughing even when alone. Intentionally take a perspective that appreciates the funny side of events. Laughing yoga is a technique of using breathing muscles to achieve the positive physical responses of natural laughing with forced laughter (ha ha hee hee ho ho). Researchers today certainly aren't laughing off its value, but a good deal of the research on laughter's influence on mental and physical health is based on self-report measures. More psychological experimentation around laughter or the contexts in which it occurs will likely support the importance of laughing throughout your day, and maybe even suggest more ways to intentionally harness its benefits.

                      These days, many people find it hard to unplug. Inflation, global warming and gun violence are on the rise. Bullies proliferate on social media. The 24/7 news cycle constantly blares distressing news, and people often face difficult personal or professional situations.  About half of Americans said they experienced stress within the past day, according to a Gallup Poll survey from last October, a finding that was consistent for most of 2022. Personal finances and current and political events were major sources of stress for one-third or more of adults, a survey from CNN in partnership with the Kaiser Family Foundation found in October.  Stress isn't inherently bad, said Richard Scrivener, a personal trainer and product development manager at London's Trainfitness, an education technology company. Stressing your muscles through weight training, for example, leads to beneficial changes. In addition, short-term stress in healthy people typically isn't a hazard. ""But if stress is continuous, especially in older or unhealthy individuals, the long-term effects of the response to stress may lead to significant health issues,"" Scrivener said. Can stress make you sick? Stress occurs when you face a new, unpredictable or threatening situation, and you don't know whether you can manage it successfully, said clinical psychologist Dr. Karmel Choi, an assistant professor in the Center for Precision Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  When you're physically or emotionally stressed, your body snaps into fight-or-flight mode. Cortisol rushes through your system, signaling your body to release glucose. Glucose, in turn, provides energy to your muscles so you are better prepared to fight off a threat or run away. During this cortisol rush, your heart rate may rise, your breathing may become rapid, and you may feel dizzy or nauseated.  If you truly needed to fight or flee a predator, your cortisol levels would drop back down once the conflict was over. When you're chronically stressed, however, those levels stay elevated.  Remaining in that heightened state is no good since high levels of cortisol can exacerbate health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic gastrointestinal problems, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Stress can also cause or contribute to anxiety, irritability, poor sleep, substance abuse, chronic distrust or worry, and more.  How to relieve stress Luckily, there are many ways to combat stress. Keep a daily routine, get plenty of sleep, eat healthy foods, and limit your time following the news or engaging in social media, recommends the World Health Organization. It also helps to stay connected with others and to employ calming practices such as meditation and deep breathing. One of the most successful tools, though, is physical activity. ""Exercise is remarkably effective for managing psychological stress,"" Choi said. ""Exercise doesn't remove what's causing the stress, but it can boost mood, reduce tension and improve sleep — all of which are impacted by stress — and ultimately this can support people to approach their challenges in a more balanced way.""  Numerous studies back up the positive effect of exercise on stress. Physical activity, and especially exercise, significantly reduced the symptoms of anxiety in a study published in Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology, for example. Similarly, a Frontiers in Psychology study of university students found that regularly engaging in low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for six weeks helped alleviate their depressive symptoms and perceived stress. Get moving to release feel-good chemicals The reason exercise is so effective in squashing stress is fairly simple. Exercise causes your body to produce more endorphins, which are neurotransmitters that boost your mood. Movement also combats elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol while improving blood flow. Jessica Honig, a clinical social worker in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, said exercise empowers her clients because they realize that, through movement, they hold the key to reset and lessen their stress. ""It's also one of the best ways to pause — to break up or revive energy from a spiraling, unproductive mindset,"" she said. What types of exercise are best? While studies show aerobic exercise, such as swimming, running, dancing and boxing, may be the most efficient at getting mood-boosting endorphins rushing through your body, gentler forms of physical activity work, too. Think yoga, strength training and walking. In addition, sometimes less is more. ""What we're seeing from the data,"" Choi said, ""is you actually need to move less than the recommended guidelines to see positive effects on mood."" Since stress loads may change weekly or even daily, Scrivener said it can be helpful to alter your exercise based on your mood. Feeling a cheery 8 on a scale of 1 to 10? Then go for a run. Barely hitting a 3? Opt for something gentle. ""This could be a 15-minute stretch followed by a light cycle for 15 minutes, or a 30-minute swim followed by a sauna session,"" he said. Make exercise a social activity Since social engagement is a powerful protective factor for positive mental health, Choi encourages exercising with others. Studies also have shown being out in nature boosts your mood, so exercising outside with friends may provide even more benefits. Scientists continue to study the link between stress and physical activity. A small study published recently found that combining mindfulness and physical activity can improve sleep and help regulate emotions more than either alone, Choi said. She also warned that people need to be careful not to go overboard on exercise or rely on it exclusively for coping with challenges. Doing so can backfire and create more stress. It's also important to remember that humans are geared to release stress physically, no matter their age, said Honig, the social worker. ""We see in children the permission to throw their body into pillows to release intense emotions,"" she said. ""We do not outgrow a need to physically release stress. We merely lose the outlets and social normalization of it.""

                      CDC to warn some travelers to watch for Marburg virus symptoms as it investigates outbreaks in Africa

                      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is sending personnel to Africa to help stop outbreaks of Marburg virus disease and is urging travelers to certain countries to take precautions.  The CDC is also taking steps to keep infections from spreading to the United States. Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania are facing their first known outbreaks of Marburg virus, a viral fever with uncontrolled bleeding that's a close cousin to Ebola. This week, the CDC urged travelers to both countries to avoid contact with sick people and to watch for symptoms for three weeks after leaving the area. Travelers to Equatorial Guinea should take enhanced precautions and avoid nonessential travel to the provinces where the outbreak is ongoing, the agency said. In the United States, the agency will post notices in international airports where most travelers arrive, warning them to watch for symptoms of the virus for 21 days and to seek care immediately if they become ill.  They will also get a text reminder to watch for symptoms. The CDC is standing up a ""center-led"" emergency response; it's not as all-encompassing as when the CDC stands up its Emergency Operations Center, such as for Covid-19 and mpox. But it will refocus the efforts and attention of the staff of its National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases to respond to the outbreaks, which are in two countries on opposite sides of Africa, indicating that the deadly hemorrhagic fever is spreading.  Equatorial Guinea, on the coast in West Africa, declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in mid-February with cases spread across multiple provinces. As of March 22, Equatorial Guinea had 13 confirmed cases, including nine people who have died and one who has recovered, according to the World Health Organization. Nine CDC staffers are on the ground there. They have established a field laboratory and are assisting with testing, case identification and contact tracing. Tanzania, on the coast in East Africa, declared an outbreak of Marburg virus disease on March 21, with cases reported in two villages in the Kagera region, according to the CDC.  As of March 22, Tanzania has had eight confirmed cases, including five deaths.  The CDC has a permanent office in Tanzania that is assisting with the outbreak. It is sending additional staff to support those efforts.  Marburg virus is a rare and deadly virus that causes fever, chills, muscle pain, rash, sore throat, diarrhea, weakness or unexplained bleeding or bruising. It is spread through contact with body fluids and contaminated surfaces.  People can also catch it from infected animals. It is fatal in about half of cases who get it. Other countries in Africa have had to quell outbreaks before. In its early stages, the infection is difficult to distinguish from other illnesses, so a history of travel to either of those countries will be essential to helping clinicians spot it.

                      Congress moves to make xylazine a controlled substance

                      US lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine, the animal tranquilizer that's increasingly infiltrating illicit drugs, as a controlled substance.  Bipartisan legislation introduced Tuesday in the House and Senate reflects growing concern over the highly dangerous sedative, commonly known as ""tranq"" or ""tranq dope."" ""Drug traffickers are going to great lengths to pad their profits with dangerous drugs like tranq, and we need to empower law enforcement to crack down on its spread in our communities,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., lead sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. ""This bipartisan legislation will ensure the DEA and local law enforcement have the tools they need to get xylazine off our streets while protecting its important use as a veterinary tranquilizer."" Xylazine has not been approved for human use. It has heavy sedative effects like an opioid but isn't one, so it doesn't respond to the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone, also known as Narcan. Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high. However, xylazine is associated with severe soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. The US Drug Enforcement Administration issued a public health alert this month noting that xylazine is widespread and has been detected in about 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pill seizures.  DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the alert that ""xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, fentanyl, even deadlier.""  Despite reports about the alarming rise of xylazine, also called a ""zombie drug,"" federal law enforcement has not had the tools to regulate it.  The proposed legislation would address this gap by making xylazine a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl.  The bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that it is not being diverted to the black market. ""Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,"" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H, a cosponsor of the bill, said in the statement. ""My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are seeing the impact of this deadly drug in their states, and we will continue working together to move this critical bill forward."" Xylazine is essential in veterinary medicine to sedate large animals like horses and cattle. Dr. Lori Teller, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said the group ""fully supports this congressional effort to combat illicit xylazine.""  ""We urge Congress to pass the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act quickly as it strikes the right balance of protecting our communities while preserving veterinary access to this critically important animal drug,"" Teller said.  However, Mary Sylla, director of overdose prevention policy and strategy at the National Harm Reduction Coalition, a national advocacy organization for people who use drugs, says the bill is a move in the wrong direction.  ""The position of the National Harm Reduction Coalition is that criminalization of drugs has never worked to reduce drug use or addiction. It's the opposite. Criminalization is the opposite of harm reduction,"" she said.  Sylla would rather to see more funding and support for evidence-based harm reduction, such as overdose prevention and syringe access programs. Harm reduction ""has evidence that it reduces drug use, it gets people engaged in treatment. It meets people where they are and allows them to make healthier choices about their substance use.""  The bill, which has been endorsed by the National Association of Police Organization and other law enforcement groups, is likely to disproportionately affect people on the lowest levels of the drug distribution chain and users themselves, says Maritza Perez, director of the Drug Policy Alliance's Office of Federal Affairs. ""Drug users are not seeking xylazine. It's often mixed into drugs that they're taking. So we have concerns that we'd be punishing drug users for a substance that they may not even know is found in their drug,"" she said. ""We would encourage lawmakers to instead fund and protect health services for people who use drugs, because that's really how we stop the harms of drug use. It's not by arresting people and throwing them behind bars."" Some states have taken matters into their own hands. Lawmakers in some states have taken steps to make xylazine a controlled substance, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed an executive order Wednesday to classify it as a Schedule III controlled substance. Lawmakers hope the bill will provide new tools to combat this deadly trend on a national level.   ""Drug overdoses remain unacceptably high as cartels and traffickers continue to flood our nation with deadly and ever-changing poison,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, another of the bill's sponsors, said in the statement. ""We cannot successfully prevent these tragedies with one hand tied behind our back.""

                      The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a salmonella outbreak that has been linked to flour, and it's urging people not to eat or play with uncooked dough or batter. A dozen illnesses -- including three hospitalizations -- have been reported in connection with the outbreak, spanning 11 states. However, the CDC says that the scale of the outbreak is probably much larger than the number of reported cases suggests. The agency has not identified specific brands of flour involved in the outbreak. Most of the patients whom the CDC has interviewed said they had eaten raw dough or batter in the week before falling ill, the timing of which spanned from December to mid-February. Flour was the only common ingredient in the raw dough or batter that was eaten. Most flour is raw and hasn't been treated to kill germs that cause food poisoning, according to the CDC. Salmonella bacteria dies when it is cooked or baked, but people can get sick when eating or tasting foods that include raw flour. Raw dough used for crafts and play clay also pose a risk. To stay safe, the CDC recommends following recipe or package instructions to fully cook cookies, cakes and other foods made with raw flour, and using warm water and soap to wash hands, utensils, countertops and anything else that comes into contact with raw four. People should also use heat-treated flour for homemade playdough. Symptoms of a salmonella infection include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps that can start within hours or days of consuming the bacteria. Most people will recover with treatment but should seek immediate attention from a health care provider if they have severe symptoms, symptoms that don't improve after a few days or signs of dehydration.

                      Emergency department visits for firearm injuries in the United States dropped slightly since 2020, but the rate in 2022 was still above pre-pandemic levels.  According to a new study published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the weekly number of emergency department visits related to firearm injuries began to rise in March 2020 before sharply increasing in May 2020 and remaining high. The sharpest increase in visits happened the week of May 24, 2020, during a ""period of increased social unrest over strained law enforcement--community relations and longstanding systemic inequities, structural racism, and trauma experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States,"" the authors wrote in the study. On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was killed by three former Minneapolis police officers. The video of his death sparked nationwide uproar related to systemic racism and inequality.  In 2021, the rate dropped slightly from 2020. In 2022, the rate fell again, but still sat above the rate of weekly emergency department visits related to firearm injuries in 2019, prior to the pandemic.  Compared to the rate of visits in 2019, 2020 was 37% higher than the previous year, 2021 was 36% higher than 2019, and 2022 was 20% higher than that year.  In 2019, the average weekly number of visits was about 979, according to the study.  In 2022, the average number of weekly visits reached 1,170.  Of those 1,170 visits, roughly 180 of them were for women and about 990 were for men.  In general, most visitors between 2019 and 2022 were 15 to 24 years of age, but there was a sharp increase in infant to 14-year-olds going to the emergency department for firearm injuries.  In 2019, on average, about 29 of the 979 people who visited an emergency department for firearm related injuries were ages 0 to 14.  In 2022, on average, infants to 14-year-olds made up about 40 of the 1,170 weekly visits.  The authors offered some background for why there was an increase in visits among children.  ""Challenges faced by children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic might have influenced their risk for firearm injury, including disruptions to daily routines and schooling,"" the authors of the study wrote.  Social isolation, physical distancing, increased time at home, changes in healthcare access, and diminished security and safety could have increased access to firearms in the home for children.  The bigger picture During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rate of firearm homicides increased by 35%, and in 2020 the rate was the highest on record since 1993, according to the study.  In 2021, the rate of firearm suicide was the highest on record since 1990. According to previous CDC data, during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, US counties with the highest poverty level had firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates that were 4.5 and 1.3 times as high, respectively, as counties with the lowest poverty level. That same year 79% of all homicides and 53% of all suicides in the US involved firearms, according to the CDC.  What can be done? More research is needed to better understand the overall causes for the increase in emergency department visits for firearm injuries, the study said.  The study said this data should be used to create a comprehensive approach to prevent and respond to firearm injuries, and to address the social and economic inequalities that contribute to an increased risk of violence.  These strategies should be community based, according to the study, and might include street outreach programs and conflict de-escalation tools.  The study authors also suggested implementing hospital-based programs that intervene with victims of violence and improving community physical environment through vacant lot remediation.  Outside of community initiatives, the authors say enhanced secure firearm storage could reduce firearm access to people who could hurt themselves or others.

                      First on CNN: CDC team studying health impacts of Ohio train derailment fell ill during investigation

                      Seven US government investigators briefly fell ill in early March while studying the possible health impacts of a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed to CNN on Thursday.   The investigators' symptoms included sore throats, headaches, coughing and nausea -- consistent with what some residents experienced after the February 3 train derailment that released a cocktail of hazardous chemicals into the air, water and soil.     The investigators who experienced symptoms were part of a team conducting a house-to-house survey in an area near the derailment, and they immediately reported their symptoms to federal safety officers.  ""Symptoms resolved for most team members later the same afternoon, and everyone resumed work on survey data collection within 24 hours. Impacted team members have not reported ongoing health effects,"" a CDC spokesperson said in the statement.  The illnesses are coming to light after repeated assurances by government officials and representatives from Norfolk Southern, the company that operated the train, that the air and drinking water in East Palestine is not hazardous to health.    It is not clear what caused the investigators' symptoms -- whether chemical exposure or something else, such as fatigue. But the team, some of whom are officers and physicians in the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, found it suspicious that they became ill at the same time and with the same symptoms, according to an official familiar with the cases who spoke to CNN.   The official asked to not be identified because they are not authorized to share details of the incident; a CDC spokesperson confirmed information in the official's account, including the date, the number of people involved and the symptoms they experienced.      Because the investigators' symptoms improved soon after they left the area, the incident was not reported to the public, the official said, noting that reports of illnesses experienced by CDC personnel on the job wouldn't ordinarily be disclosed.  Still, experts in chemical exposures say the episode is significant.  ""It adds confirmation that the symptoms reported by East Palestine residents are real and are associated with environmental exposures from the derailment and chemical fire,"" said David Michaels, an epidemiologist and professor at the George Washington University School of Public Health who ran the Occupational Safety and Health Administration between 2009 and 2017. He has not been involved in the investigation in East Palestine.  In a separate case in February, two contractors who were working for the US Environmental Protection Agency reported symptoms related to strong odors and reported them to the site safety officer. The safety officer advised the contractors to step away from the area where they were working and monitor their symptoms, according to a statement sent to CNN by an EPA spokesperson. Their symptoms eased, and they returned to work at the site the same day.  No other incidents have been reported by more than 100 EPA personnel deployed to the site, the statement said.  CNN asked the EPA where the contractors were working and what they were doing when they experienced these symptoms, but the EPA did not respond by deadline.    A spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency says its safety officer didn't receive any reports of staff experiencing symptoms while working in the area.  Andrew Whelton, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Purdue University who has been traveling to East Palestine to conduct independent testing for the town, says he hopes the government agencies will continue to be forthcoming about the experiences of their staff and contractors in the area.  ""I think it is important for not only government officials to communicate with each other, but also to communicate their experiences with the public, so that everybody can understand what's going on, and how help needs to be brought to East Palestine and the surrounding areas,"" Whelton told CNN.  Team experienced symptoms they were investigating  The cause of the February 3 crash is still under investigation, but preliminary reports suggest that a wheel bearing on the train overheated, caught fire and failed -- sending 11 cars carrying more than a million pounds of hazardous chemicals off the tracks.  Chemicals spilled into the soil and air and into two small creeks that run through the town. A car carrying flammable vinyl chloride became unstable, sparking fears of a massive explosion. Nearby residents were evacuated while small holes were punched in the railcars so the vinyl chloride could be channeled into a trench where it was burned. A black mushroom cloud rose over the town and left ash and soot on cars and buildings for miles around.   Since February 8, when the burning railcars were finally extinguished, state and federal officials have consistently told East Palestine residents that they have not detected any chemicals linked to the derailment in air or drinking water at levels that would threaten human health.  Yet people living in East Palestine and the surrounding area have continued to share stories about unexplained symptoms including headaches, sore throats, nasal congestion, bloody noses, skin rashes, coughs and eye irritation.  The government team that experienced symptoms is from the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, or ATSDR, a branch that assesses the health impacts of chemical exposures. After the train derailment, ATSDR sent 15 people to East Palestine to conduct an Assessment of Chemical Exposure, known as an ACE investigation.  They often worked 18-hour days, going door-to-door to ask residents a detailed set of questions about where they spent their time in the days after the spill and what symptoms they or their pets may have experienced.  They worked in small groups of two and three to visit houses in the areas that they expected to be the most affected by the chemicals based on their proximity to the spill and two area creeks, Leslie Run and Sulphur Run, which have been heavily contaminated. They also surveyed parts of nearby Beaver County, Pennsylvania, which was downwind of the spill on the night of the derailment and the controlled burn of five tankers of vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make PVC pipe.   It's not clear what area the team members were in when they began to feel ill.  The CDC spokesperson said the other eight members of the team did not experience symptoms.  The official who was familiar with the cases said team members reported their illnesses to the EPA's on-site safety officer, who advised them to return to their hotel in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles from East Palestine, and to the CDC's Office of Safety, Security and Asset Management, or OSSAM, the agency's workplace safety office. OSSAM agreed with the EPA assessment that team members should return to their hotel that night, March 6. The team then worked from their hotel on March 7, according to the official.  The CDC acknowledged the incident to CNN after posts began circulating on social media saying the team was sent home because they got sick; the official said that wasn't the case.  Members of the team began to rotate out of the area as they finished their work. Most of the  team members left March 10, and the last member left March 16, according to the official.  Early results of the Ohio ACE survey show that more than half of the 514 residents who have taken it so far have experienced symptoms after the derailment. The top symptoms reported by residents in the area are headaches, reported by 74% of people taking the survey; anxiety (61%); coughing (53%); fatigue (53%); pain, irritation or burning of the skin (50%); and stuffy nose/sinus congestion (50%), according to the Ohio Department of Health. The questions on the survey ask about a ""burning nose or throat"" but didn't specifically mention sore throats or nausea.    The surveys can't prove that residents were exposed to harmful levels of chemicals or that those chemicals caused their symptoms. They are meant to be a snapshot, documenting the health of the community after an event that results in potentially hazardous exposures.  The ATSDR team reports the results of the surveys back to the state departments of health and may make recommendations based on the findings. The team is doing a total of three reports: one for Ohio, one for residents in Pennsylvania and a third on the first responders to the derailment.  Preliminary results are expected to be shared with the states in early April, with final reports released to the public within a few months.  As of March 28, ATSDR had conducted 1,002 ACE surveys: 686 for area residents and 316 for derailment responders, the CDC spokesperson said in an email to CNN.  Cleanup continues   The EPA continues real-time air monitoring in East Palestine using a specially equipped bus that samples and tests the air. To date, the agency reports that the cleanup has removed an estimated 11,961 tons of contaminated soil and 9.2 million gallons of liquid wastewater.  It has also tested the indoor air of 624 area homes and sampled the soil at 115 properties in the area.  The agency said this week that early results of its dioxin testing have not shown any levels above expected background levels, although it didn't release any of the test results, which are still going through quality checks.  Testing conducted by the Ohio EPA shows that two creeks that run through East Palestine are still testing positive for chemicals released by the spill. The state is using aerators to increase oxygen in the water to speed the breakdown of those chemicals.  The testing shows that the chemical levels in the streams are dropping over time, but some chemicals spilled from the train are still being detected almost two months after the derailment. On a recent visit to the area, EPA Administrator Michael Regan said children and adults should not go near the creeks.  ""As a father, I would not advise anybody -- adult or child -- play in the creeks or stream. What we've said is the drinking water has been tested"" and found to be safe, Regan said at a news conference in East Palestine on March 1.  At a hearing this month, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw was asked whether he would live in East Palestine, given what he knows about the derailment.  ""Yes, sir,"" Shaw responded in testimony before the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee on March 9. ""I believe that the air is safe. I believe that the water is safe. There are hundreds of tests, there are millions of data points, and they all point to the same thing.""  To residents, the official assurances that everything is fine sound hollow.  ""They're all scientists. They're sitting up here telling us nothing's wrong. I want you to tell

                      Advisers to the World Health Organization will consider next month whether to add liraglutide, the active ingredient in certain diabetes and obesity medications, to its list of essential medicines. The list, which is updated every two years, includes medicines ""that satisfy the priority health needs of the population,"" WHO says. ""They are intended to be available within the context of function health systems at all times, in adequate amounts in the appropriate dosage forms, of assured quality and at prices that individuals and the community can afford.""   The list is ""a guide for the development and updating of national and institutional essential medicine lists to support the procurement and supply of medicines in the public sector, medicines reimbursement schemes, medicine donations, and local medicine production."" The WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines is scheduled to meet April 24-28 to discuss revisions and updates involving dozens of medications. The request to add GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide came from four researchers at US institutions including Yale University and Brigham and Women's Hospital. These drugs mimic the effects of an appetite-regulating hormone, GLP-1, and stimulate the release of insulin. This helps lower blood sugar and slows the passage of food through the gut. Liraglutide was developed to treat diabetes but approved in the US as a weight-loss treatment in 2014; its more potent cousin, semaglutide, has been approved for diabetes since 2017 and as an obesity treatment in 2021. The latter use has become well-known thanks to promotions from celebrities and on social media. It's sold under the name Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss.  Studies suggest that semaglutide may help people lose an average of 10% to 15% of their starting weight -- significantly more than with other medications. But because of this high demand, some versions of the medication have been in shortage in the US since the middle of last year.  The US patent on liraglutide is set to expire this year, and drugmaker Novo Nordisk says generic versions could be available in June 2024. The company has not been involved in the application to WHO, it said in a statement, but ""we welcome the WHO review and look forward to the readout and decision."" ""At present, there are no medications included in the [Essential Medicines List] that specifically target weight loss for the global burden of obesity,"" the researchers wrote in their request to WHO. ""At this time, the EML includes mineral supplements for nutritional deficiencies yet it is also described that most of the population live in 'countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.' "" WHO's advisers will make recommendations on which drugs should be included in this year's list, expected to come in September. ""This particular drug has a certain history, but the use of it probably has not been long enough to be able to see it on the Essential Medicines List,"" Dr. Francesco Blanca, WHO director for nutrition and food safety, said at a briefing Wednesday. ""There's also issues related to the cost of the treatment. At the same time, WHO is looking at the use of drugs to reduce weight excess in the context of a systematic review for guidelines for children and adolescents. So we believe that it is a work in progress, but we'll see what the Essential Medicines List committee is going to conclude.""

                      Mysterious hepatitis outbreak in kids in 2022 linked to common childhood respiratory virus, studies suggest

                      An outbreak of acute severe, unexplained hepatitis in previously healthy children in 2022 may be linked to adeno-associated virus 2, or AAV2, according to three independent studies published Thursday in the journal Nature.  Between April and July 2022, more than 1,000 children worldwide -- at least 350 of them in the United States -- were diagnosed with hepatitis, a disease involving liver inflammation, with no known cause. Nearly 50 needed liver transplants, and 22 children died, according to the World Health Organization.  New research suggests that AAV2 might be implicated in the disease. This common childhood virus cannot copy itself unless in the presence of another ""helper"" virus, such as adenovirus or herpesvirus. AAV2 was present among nearly all of the children with unexplained acute hepatitis, and many were infected with multiple helper viruses, the researchers found.  Although the researchers can't say for sure, the timing of the outbreak may have been associated with the global loosening of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions after periods of relative isolation. ""Children were suddenly exposed to a barrage of viruses after lockdowns or had poorly trained immune systems that led to an increased susceptibility to otherwise harmless viruses,"" Dr. Frank Tacke, a gastroenterologist from Germany who was not involved with the research, wrote in an editorial published alongside the new studies.  Consistent link among studies  One of the new studies, which analyzed tissue samples from children in the United States, detected AAV2 in 93% of 14 cases but only 4% of 113 controls. The researchers found that all children infected with AAV2 had co-infection with a ""helper"" virus -- either human herpesvirus 6 or Epstein-Barr virus -- that might promote AAV2 replication.  ""Our results suggest that co-infection with AAV2 may cause more severe liver disease than infection by an adenovirus or herpesvirus alone,"" the authors wrote.  A second study, which took place in the United Kingdom, reported high levels of AAV2 in 96% of 28 affected children and only low levels in a control group. Low levels of human adenovirus and human herpesvirus 6 were found in the liver in most cases, which the authors similarly speculate enabled AAV2 replication and liver damage. A third study suggests that abnormal immune response might promote AAV2 liver damage. Researchers in the United Kingdom found high levels of AAV2 in blood and liver samples of 81% of 32 affected children and detected only low AAV2 levels in 7% of 74 unaffected children. Among the affected group, 93% carried a genetic mutation that predisposes a person to autoimmune diseases involving T cells, a type of immune cell.  Further research needed Scientists previously believed that human adenovirus, which typically causes mild cold- or flu-like illness, may have been responsible for the outbreak. However, adenovirus usually affects only people with very weak immune systems, and various strains indicated that a single viral strain could not explain the outbreak, which cast doubt on this hypothesis. The new findings are ""likely to spark debate, and could influence disease management,"" Tacke said.  Uncovering the mechanism will be important for treatment. If AAV2 is responsible, antivirals would be appropriate. If it is due an unusual immune response, drugs that weaken the immune system might be necessary.  Although the consistent findings across two continents provide strong evidence, several uncertainties remain, including whether AAV2 directly causes liver damage or is ""just a bystander."" For example, because they can't replicate on their own, adeno-associated viruses are commonly used as vehicles for gene therapy. Although liver damage has been observed in trials that involve AAV-based approaches, it is rare and generally not fatal, scientists say.  ""If AAV2 directly caused hepatitis, one would expect more cases to have been reported,"" Tacke said.  More studies are needed to understand how AAV2 infection alone, or with another virus, might affect liver cells, he recommended. ""Until then, surveillance for AAV2 (and related viruses) in such cases is to be advised,"" he said.

                      Prescriptions for ADHD treatments surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC report shows

                      Prescriptions for stimulants often used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder surged during the pandemic, especially among adults, a new study found. The finding comes as one common ADHD treatment, Adderall, has been in shortage for months, in part because of high demand. Diagnoses for ADHD have become more common in recent decades, and prescriptions for stimulant drugs that are most often used to treat the neurodevelopmental disorder have also been on the rise. But the new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights a recent surge in demand for the drug and others like it. Between 2016 and 2020, the share of the population that had filled a prescription for a stimulant drug held relatively steady. But there was a large increase in 2021, with prescription fills jumping more than 10% across most age groups. Overall, the CDC analysis of private insurance records shows that more than 4% of people ages 5 to 64 had filled a prescription for a stimulant in 2021, up from 3.8% in 2020. The vast majority of people who are prescribed stimulant medications have an ADHD diagnosis or are being treated for symptoms of the disorder.   ADHD is typically identified in childhood and has been more prevalent among boys, and the CDC analysis found that stimulant prescriptions were consistently most common among boys ages 5 to 19.  However, the largest annual increases in 2021 were among adults, especially women in their 20s and 30s. There are well-established clinical guidelines for ADHD care for children and adolescents, with an outline of symptoms that show a persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity. While there is growing recognition of ADHD in adults, a comparable playbook for adults does not exist. The gap in guidance for adults is a public health concern in part because of the ""general inadequate access to mental health providers trained to diagnose and manage ADHD,"" according to the researchers. ""Development of clinical recommendations for diagnosing and managing adult ADHD could help guide safe and appropriate stimulant prescribing,"" they wrote. While stimulants can offer ""substantial benefits"" for people with ADHD, there are also potential harms including misuse and overdose. Nearly 33,000 people died from an overdose involving a psychostimulant in 2021, CDC data shows. Methamphetamine is primary drug involved, but deaths have nearly doubled since 2019. The sharp rise in prescriptions for stimulants during the pandemic also raises questions about the role of telehealth. Expanded access to telehealth during the pandemic could have removed barriers and encouraged more people to seek care, especially during a time when mental health struggles were exacerbated.  But it also could have introduced greater potential for inadequate evaluations or inappropriate stimulant prescribing, according to the researchers. ""Evaluation of policies enacted during the pandemic could identify benefits and harms of those policies,"" they wrote. Some people who use stimulants for ADHD have struggled for months to fill their prescriptions.  The US Food and Drug Administration announced a shortage of Adderall on October 12, 2022. The agency noted that it was in communication with all manufacturers of amphetamine mixed salts and that one of those companies was ""experiencing ongoing intermittent manufacturing delays."" Although other manufacturers continued to produce the drug, the agency said, ""there is not sufficient supply to continue to meet U.S. market demand through those producers."" Jim McKinney, a spokesperson for the agency, told CNN last month that the manufacturing delay has been resolved and that the shortage is now ""demand-driven."" On its website, the FDA lists eight manufacturers that have reported Adderall shortages to the agency. The website lists the shortage reason for some versions of the drug, such as ""demand increase"" or ""shortage of active ingredient,"" but for other versions, it just says ""other"" or lists no reason at all.

                      Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin said Wednesday that when he played football as a child, he never thought about CPR or where there might be an automated external defibrillator (AED) nearby. At an event on Capitol Hill, the NFL player shared facts he learned after he went into cardiac arrest and collapsed on the field during a game in January. ""Sudden cardiac arrest happens to more than 7,000 kids under the age of 18 every year in our country -- 7,000 kids every year. The majority of the kids impacted are student-athletes, and research shows that 1 in every 300 youth has an undetected heart condition that puts them at risk. For schools that have AEDs, the survival rate for the children from sudden cardiac arrest is seven times higher,"" Hamlin said.   Hamlin joined Reps. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla., and Bill Posey, R-Fla., to highlight the Access to AEDs Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in the US House this week. It would establish a grant program to provide schools with the funds to purchase and maintain AEDs, strengthen CPR training and develop cardiac emergency response plans, Cherfilus-McCormick said. ""The Access to AEDs Act will help ensure that schools are just as prepared and trained to respond in the time of crisis as those on the sidelines of an NFL game,"" Hamlin said.  Also at the event was Matthew Mangine Sr., who lost his 16-year-old son, Matthew Jr., in 2020.  The teen, a soccer player at St. Henry District High School in Erlanger, Kentucky, collapsed from sudden cardiac arrest on the soccer field during practice.  ""There were five AEDs on campus, yet no one retrieved an AED to apply to Matthew due to a lack of proper training. And because the coach was never given an emergency action plan nor was told where the nearest AED was -- which was 250 feet away -- by the time the ambulance arrived, it was too late. We lost our beautiful firstborn son,"" Mangine said.   People often find out about heart conditions too late, Posey said, and this is one way to help effect change. ""There's a lot of ways that young people can die, and there's very few ways that we can actually get engaged to prevent those deaths,"" he said. Hamlin did not discuss his future in football on Wednesday but previously told ""Good Morning America"" that he is ""doing great"" physically but ""still working through things"" emotionally. The cause of his cardiac arrest has not been determined, but Dr. Thom Mayer, medical director of the NFL Players Association, said last month that Hamlin ""will play professional football again.""  Hamlin has also partnered with the American Heart Association on a campaign to increase CPR awareness and education. ""Having community members trained in CPR, making AEDs available in schools and encouraging the development of emergency response plans will make schools better prepared to respond to sudden cardiac arrest and save lives,"" association CEO Nancy Brown said in a statement about the bill.  On Monday, the NFL announced the Smart Heart Sports Coalition, a joint effort with other professional sports leagues, the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross to promote emergency action plans, accessible AEDs, and CPR and AED training for coaches at high schools. In a video at Wednesday's event, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league is also proud to support the Access to AEDs Act.  Hamlin's recovery is ""an inspiration,"" he said, and the legislation and coalition ""no doubt will save countless lives of young athletes in the future."" ""We look forward to getting this bill signed into law as soon as possible,"" he added.

                      Sleep apnea and snoring: 8 warning signs to look for

                      Obstructive sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds or more at a time.  Snoring can be a key sign of obstructive sleep apnea — but at some point in our lives, we all snore.  A cold or allergy can block nasal passages, a few drinks too close to bed will automatically relax tongue, palate and throat muscles — and before we know it, we're unconsciously forcing air past soft tissues, causing vibrations that escape as a snore. ""Snoring can be normal and not something to worry about,"" said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School.  ""When it's loud, raucous snoring, or it's interrupted by pauses in breathing, that's where we start to get concerned."" It's estimated that at least 25 million American adults and 936 million adults between the ages of 30 and 69 worldwide may suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, with many more people undiagnosed. Sleep apnea can be dangerous The condition is called ""obstructive"" sleep apnea because unlike central sleep apnea — in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe — obstructive sleep apnea is due to a blockage of the airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues. ""You're making the effort with your belly and your chest to try to get the air in and out, but because of the obstruction in the upper airway, you can't. Often you aren't aware of this struggle, but it can be very, very scary for anyone watching,"" said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. If left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea puts you at high risk for hypertension, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or depression, and even an early death, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. How can you tell when your snoring has become dangerous to your health? Sleep experts use a sleep questionnaire with an easy-to-follow acronym: STOP BANG.  Is snoring bad? Snoring is a key indicator, so it's a no-duh that it leads the list of potential warnings signs. But this is no quiet gentle snore, and certainly not a snore that anyone could ever call ""cute.""  ""We're talking loud, obnoxious snoring, the type that would drown out conversations or be heard through closed doors,"" Dasgupta said. ""Some of the very descriptive bed partners of my patients with obstructive sleep apnea describe their partners' snores as listening to a 'dying bear' or a scene from 'Jurassic Park.'"" How tired are you?  Being really tired during the day is a prime indicator of poor sleep, Robbins said. Combined with snoring, it can be a telltale symptom of sleep apnea.  ""Falling asleep anytime you have a moment — sitting down for a break after lunch, in a movie theater — those are all hallmark symptoms along with fatigue and taking the house down with your snores,"" said Robbins, who coauthored the book, ""Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But Are Too Tired to Ask."" Partners often observe apnea Many people — if not most — have no idea that they snore at night. Nor do they know they stop breathing during the night, unless the blockage is so bad that they wake up gasping and choking.  ""The O stands for observed apnea, and that's actually worse than just snoring,"" Dasgupta said. ""An apnea means no flow of air — no air coming in no air going out. You're not breathing. Observed apnea is really a red flag."" Bed partners are often key to the identification of obstructive sleep apnea. ""Watching your partner stop breathing, snore, cough or gasp for air are all signs the snoring might not be normal, and then it is something that deserves attention from a sleep specialist,"" Robbins said. Sleep apnea and high blood pressure Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to hypertension. Every time a person stops breathing for a few seconds, the body's sympathetic nervous system goes into action and raises blood pressure. In addition, the body releases stress hormones called catecholamines, which can also raise blood pressure over time.  While having hypertension by itself is not a sign of a sleep disorder, it can be a warning sign when combined with other telltale signals. Fortunately, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea, like continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, have not only been shown to help with sleep apnea — they also lower blood pressure. Weight and sleep apnea What's your body mass index? That's a score commonly used to indicate levels of weight. To measure BMI, health professionals use height and weight data to track changes in weight relative to height. Your weight is considered normal if your BMI falls between 18.5 and 24.9. You are deemed overweight when your BMI is between 25 and 29.9 — and a BMI of 30 or more indicates you are obese. People who are obese or extremely obese (with a BMI of 35 and above) are frequently found to have obstructive sleep apnea because the extra weight in the mouth, tongue and neck collapses those soft tissues, making it more difficult to easily breathe without snoring. ""Weight loss can be a big part of the recommendation from a health care provider for addressing sleep apnea,"" Robbins said.  Obstructive sleep apnea has been on the rise around the world as obesity has reached epidemic proportions, but it wasn't seen as frequently before the 1970s, she added.  Age, gender, neck circumstance are predictors Muscle tone weakens as we age, including in our soft palate and neck. So being older than age 50 is another potential signal that your snoring may be or could turn into obstructive sleep apnea.  There is some good news: Studies are beginning to find that sleep apnea in the elderly tends to be of a mild to moderate kind, with the more severe cases occurring at younger ages. Having a large neck circumference, either from being overweight or genetics, is also a key indicator of potential obstructive sleep apnea.  ""Now you don't want to be a weirdo and start measuring your loved one's neck build at night,"" Dasgupta said. ""The rule of thumb is always going to be a collar size of greater than 17 inches (43 centimeters) for a male, and greater than 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) for a female will put you at a higher risk for sleep apnea."" Are you a man? Then unfortunately, that, too, makes you at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Some of the reasons may be that men tend to have fatter tongues and carry more fat in their upper bodies than women, especially in the neck. Men also tend to have more ""belly fat,"" which can make breathing in general more difficult. ""However, we definitely see a lot more obstructive sleep apnea in women after menopause,"" Dasgupta said. Are you at high risk for sleep apnea? Now it's time to score your risk.  Give yourself a point for every ""yes"" answer to these questions: Do you snore? Are you tired during the day? Does your partner witness you snoring? Do you have high blood pressure? Are you overweight? Are you older? Do you have a larger neck circumference? Are you a man?   If you scored between 5 and 8, you are at high risk of having obstructive sleep apnea and should be evaluated by a sleep specialist.  ""Sleep tests nowadays are much, much easier to get than in prior years when you could only go to a sleep lab,"" Dasgupta said. ""You don't have to be stuck in the lab with all these wires on you, looking like Frankenstein. You can do an at-home sleep test in your own bed, which is nice."" But don't ignore your symptoms, as the negative effects on health should not be ignored, says the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: ""Like a fire alarm, snoring is a warning of danger that demands your attention."" If your score is between 0 and 2, your risk is obviously low, so snoring isn't likely to be a big concern for your health. A score of 3 to 4 puts you at an intermediate risk, but that doesn't mean you should ignore your symptoms, especially if you share your bed with a loved one, Dasgupta said. ""It's always good to be a nice person, and if it affects your bed partner, I think it's worthwhile getting evaluated,"" he said. ""If your bed partner is wakened multiple times during the night by your snoring or can't fall asleep because of your snores, then that bed partner is going to be sleep deprived, and that is not good for their health. So it's not always about yourself."" How to treat sleep apnea? The treatment of choice for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. By pushing air into the lungs through a nose mask, the device helps keep the airway unobstructed throughout the night.  Weight loss can significantly decrease — or even eliminate obstructive sleep apnea, as the loss of tissue mass in the mouth, tongue and neck eases pressure on the airway. Doctors can also prescribe an oral appliance designed to enlarge the airway by moving the tongue or jaw forward. If anatomical issues, such as nasal polyps, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or a deviated septum, are contributing to the apnea, surgery may be recommended.  Mild cases of sleep apnea may respond to ""positional therapy,"" a fancy way of saying keeping sleepers on their sides instead of back during sleep, which can improve airway flow and reduce snoring.  ""I'm a big fan of simple, homemade solutions, such as sewing tennis balls into the back of pajamas to keep people from turning onto their backs,"" Dasgupta said. ""You can get even more creative by putting a bra on someone in reverse and then putting tennis balls in in the cups,"" Robbins suggested.

                      Janssen, the pharmaceutical division of the Johnson & Johnson companies, announced Wednesday that it will scrap development of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in adults. The company was in late-stage clinical trials of a vaccine to prevent lower respiratory tract disease in adults over the age of 60 with RSV.  The vaccine being tested was using an adenovirus vector platform, similar to the technology behind in its Covid-19 vaccine.      In an email to CNN, Johnson & Johnson did not elaborate further on the company's reasons for shelving the vaccine, which had had looked promising in its phase II study including nearly 6,000 adults in 40 study sites across the US. The findings of that study, which were published in February in the New England Journal of Medicine, show that the vaccine was 70% effective at preventing RSV infection with one symptom and 80% effective at preventing more severe illness due to RSV. The move comes shortly after rival drugmakers Pfizer and GSK posted positive results for RSV vaccine candidates targeted to older adults.    J&J's stage III clinical trial had enrolled more than 27,000 patients at over 300 study sites in the US and other countries, according to ClinicalTrials.gov, a public database of ongoing research.    The company said in a news release that the trial was being stopped after a portfolio review ""to prioritize the most transformational assets for ongoing investment"" and after an assessment of the ""respiratory syncytial virus vaccine landscape.""      ""By periodically refocusing our portfolio, Janssen ensures that we are deeply invested in products that have the power to transform patients' lives,"" Dr. Bill Hait, medical officer and interim head of Janssen research and development, said in the release.   ""We remain focused on advancing our differentiated pipeline, improving the lives of millions of patients and developing new modalities in areas with the greatest unmet medical need,"" Hait said.

                      More symptoms than you think may be tied to your migraines

                      Contrary to what internalized stigma may tell you, a migraine isn't just a headache. In people younger than age 50, chronic migraines are the leading cause of disability, according to a 2018 study. But many people who live with the condition can have a hard time recognizing its seriousness and getting the medical care they need for their migraines, said Kylie Petrarca, a nurse and associate program director of the Association of Migraine Disorders. ""People don't give it the recognition it deserves,"" she added. Many doctors don't know enough about the nuances of migraine disorders, said Dr. Frederick Godley, an ear, nose and throat specialist and president of the Association of Migraine Disorders.  But there are professionals researching and treating migraine conditions. A new study that was published Wednesday in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology, has shown that both cluster headaches and migraines have a connection to circadian systems, meaning time of day and sleep patterns might have a big impact on those conditions. Understanding what migraines are, why you may get them and what you can do is a powerful tool to advocate for yourself and get the proper treatment, Petrarca said.  What are migraines? What used to be called a migraine headache is now called a migraine attack to better capture how much further the condition extends beyond pain in the head, Petrarca said.  Migraines start deep in the brain, said Dr. Stewart Tepper, a neurologist based in Lebanon, New Hampshire. The condition is better understood as a complex neurological disease that affects many parts of the nervous system, Godley said.   To be diagnosed with a migraine condition, a patient has to have at least five attacks in their lifetime that each last four to 72 hours when left untreated. The condition must also meet at least two of four criteria: moderate to severe intensity, throbbing pain, worsening with activity, and occurrence on one side of the head, Tepper said. The attacks also must have at least one of two features: nausea and sensitivity to light or sound, he added. Where do migraines come from? It's hard to say exactly, but there is a lot of evidence to show there are genetic and environmental factors that lead to people getting migraines, Petrarca said. Migraines tend to be passed down in families, but can still present differently among various family members, Godley said.  Although genetics are a major cause, some migraines can also be caused by head injuries, he added. And hormonal changes, particularly in estrogen, can really impact migraine attacks. It is important to note, however, that there is a difference between what causes someone to be prone to migraines and what triggers them, Tepper said.  What are the triggers? Migraine triggers are different for everyone, so Petrarca recommends keeping a diary of when you get attacks so you can track what factors might correlate. People usually start to get their migraines after puberty, but they can show up in younger children in forms like colic, motion sickness and dizziness, Godley said.  For many women, migraine attacks tend to go along with phases of the menstrual cycle as estrogen levels change, Petrarca said. But they can also be triggered by weather changes, stress, sleep disturbances, skipping meals, dehydration and alcohol, she added.  Unfortunately, both chocolate and wine can be a big trigger, Petrarca said. But each person who suffers migraines will have their own triggers.  What are the symptoms?  When people think of migraines, they often think of head pain. But a lot of people experience many more symptoms than that.  About a third of people will experience an aura leading up to their migraine, which is ""a temporary perceptual disturbance that lasts from five minutes to an hour,"" Petrarca said. That can look like blurred vision, seeing spots, numbness in the extremities or changes in speech, she added.  The list of possible symptoms that go along with a migraine is long but includes: dizziness, vertigo, brain fog, tinnitus, mood changes, yawning, neck pain and food craving, Petrarca said.  ""I think kind of taking it away from just the head pain, you know there's many, many other symptoms that also go along with a migraine attack,"" she said.  And some of the symptoms, including exhaustion, can happen before a migraine, after it or in between attacks, Tepper added. What can you do about them? There are many medications you can discuss with your doctor to treat migraine attacks or prevent them from happening, but it is important to find a doctor who understands migraine conditions, Godley said.  Because medical professionals who are well versed in treating migraines are in short supply, you may need to advocate for yourself and your pain to get a diagnosis and effective treatment, Petrarca said.  When you get those medications, have them ready and try to take them as soon as you start having symptoms rather than waiting until later, she added. ""It's very hard to kind of stop it once it's started,"" she said.  But medication isn't the only way to address migraine disorders. One of the first things a person can do is make modifications to their lifestyle, Petrarca said.  Cognitive behavioral therapy is often useful to help manage the stress that can trigger migraine attacks, and taking vitamins and supplements, such as magnesium and riboflavin, can be effective in reducing migraine frequency, she said. But getting down to the basics of health can be extremely helpful — track your migraines, create a sleep routine, exercise regularly, eat well-balanced meals, manage stress and stay hydrated, Petrarca said.

                      A new procedure offers hope to 'no option' patients facing amputation because of severe circulation problems

                      Cynthia Elford loves to travel and hike, but a few years ago, her Type 1 diabetes made getting around nearly impossible. By 2018, the Pennsylvania grandmother faced the possibility of losing her right leg because of a diabetes-related circulation problem, and she developed sores on her toes that kept getting worse.  She pleaded with her doctor to try to save her right leg. She had already lost the left leg to the same circulation problems. ""I told him I didn't think that I'd be able to make it if I lost my other leg,"" said Elford, 63. ""I was too active of a person."" Dr. Mehdi H. Shishehbor, president of University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute in Cleveland, told her that she might be in luck.  People with extreme circulatory problems like Elford have typically been considered ""no-option"" patients, destined to lose their foot or leg. But University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute had joined a clinical trial that might be able to help her.  Elford didn't hesitate to say yes to the trial, even when Shishehbor warned her that it would involve a lot of pain, at least at first.  Elford became the first person in Ohio to undergo the new procedure, called LimFlow.  Shishehbor has been perfecting LimFlow for the past five years or so, he said. He helped test it in a small number of people to make sure the technique was feasible and safe. Doctors then expanded the research to a multicenter trial with 105 participants. The results were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. LimFlow is a minimally invasive technique that can help people with the extreme form of peripheral artery disease called chronic limb-threatening ischemia, or CLTI. With peripheral artery disease or PAD, a fatty sticky substance called plaque accumulates on the inner surface of the arteries that lead to the legs. This causes the blood vessels to narrow and reduces circulation to the legs and feet.  Without an adequate supply of blood to the area, wounds and ulcers are slow to heal or won't heal at all, and that can damage tissue. Infection can spread to the bones. A lack of bloodflow can also result in gangrene.  CLTI carries a high mortality rate: About 25% of people don't survive one year after diagnosis, studies show. For some, blockages can be cleared through a surgical procedure, and circulation can be restored. But in 20% to 30% of cases, that standard care doesn't work, Shishehbor said. The blockages cannot be cleared, and amputation has been the only option. With the LimFlow procedure, doctors take an artery ahead of the blockage and connect it to an unblocked vein in the lower leg using a stent graft, a small kind of mesh tube, reversing the flow in that vein to send blood to the foot.  It's an outpatient procedure done under the same kind of sedation that doctors use for a colonoscopy, so there's no general anesthesia. It's all done with needles, one in the groin and another in the foot, and catheterization, the use of a flexible tube, Shishehbor said.  The procedure was performed successfully in all but one of the 105 study participants. The study was designed with a median participant age of 70. More than 30% of the participants were female, and 43% were Black, Hispanic or Latino. Diversity was key, the study authors said, because people of color with PAD are disproportionately at risk of amputation compared with White patients, studies show. Six months after the procedure, 76% of the participants had still been able to keep their leg; 76% had completely healed, or their wounds were healing.  ""It's been incredible,"" Shishehbor said. When he started with the trial, he thought that preventing amputation in even 20% of patients would be successful. ""I'd be happy, because the alternative would be 100% amputation. So the fact that we were able to, in 76% of the time, save the limb of the patients that had no options, it made me very proud and very happy and excited. ""We feel that we are going to give hope to so many patients,"" Shishebor added. Dr. Christopher Abularrage, a vascular surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the patient population targeted in the study had previously had no option but amputation.  ""This new technique provides vascular surgeons and also other interventionalists further options to decrease major amputations and improve amputation-free survival,"" said Abularrage, who was not involved in the new research. The minimally invasive aspect of the procedure is also an advantage, he said, because this group often has multiple other health conditions.  ""It's minimally invasive in this sick population versus what could be a three-, four-hour open surgery with large wounds, blood loss, cardiac risk,"" Abularrage said. ""I think that this is going to expand the use of this technique for years to come for those people who, unfortunately, don't have options for a bypass."" Dr. Michael Conte, a vascular surgeon at UCSF, takes a more cautious tack because there was no control group in the trial, and he doesn't feel that it was completely clear that it worked.  ""Half the patients at the end of the study still had open wounds. Fifty percent to 60% still needed other procedures. The story was far from over when the study ended for most of these patients,"" said Conte, who was not involved in the study.  He's also concerned that because it's an innovative procedure, some providers may choose it instead of a more reliable conventional approach, even for people who have other options like surgery. But for people without alternatives, he said, it could be an option. ""I think the vascular community needs to interpret this with some excitement, but cautious excitement,"" Conte said.  The trial data has been submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration, Shishehbor said, and the researchers hope to hear by May whether LimFlow will be approved. A lot of people stand to benefit if it's approved. In the US alone, about 160,000 people are diagnosed with this ""no-option"" form of the circulatory disease every year, one study showed.  And the number will probably grow as the number of people with diabetes -- a known risk factor -- continues to rise. About 6.5 million people 40 and older in the United States have PAD, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and being older than 60 are also risk factors. Lower limb amputations are 10 times more likely in people who have diabetes than those who don't, according to the World Health Organization.  For Elford, the procedure offered an immediate sense of hope.  ""I was way groggy and out of it, but I remember they all stood around clapping when the procedure was over,"" she said. There was intense pain, at least at first, she said. Shishehbor said it takes about four to six weeks for the body to find its equilibrium and restart the process of healing. ""It was horrible pain, and I can see why a lot of people might give up,"" Elford said. ""Eventually, the pain started lessening, and it was getting better, and it was just amazing how then I have no pain in my leg whatsoever, and it's very strong."" Shishehbor said some of his patients are five or six years past the procedure and are still are doing well. One of them is Elford, who said she is eternally grateful to her doctor. ""I'm walking. I go shopping. I drive,"" Elford said. ""Yeah, he's my miracle.""

                      With drug overdose deaths continuing to hover near record levels, the US Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved for the first time an over-the-counter version of the opioid overdose antidote Narcan. ""The FDA remains committed to addressing the evolving complexities of the overdose crisis. As part of this work, the agency has used its regulatory authority to facilitate greater access to naloxone by encouraging the development of and approving an over-the-counter naloxone product to address the dire public health need,""  FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement.  ""Today's approval of OTC naloxone nasal spray will help improve access to naloxone, increase the number of locations where it's available and help reduce opioid overdose deaths throughout the country. We encourage the manufacturer to make accessibility to the product a priority by making it available as soon as possible and at an affordable price.""  Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, said accessibility is key to ensuring that the Narcan nasal spray saves lives. ""It's really important that we continue to do everything possible in our power to make this life-saving drug available to anyone and everyone across the country,"" Gupta said.  The White House drug czar said businesses, such as restaraunts and banks, and schools will be encouraged to purchase over-the-counter naloxone.  ""We will encourage businesses, restaurants, banks, construction sites, schools, others to think about this -- think about it as a smoke alarm or a defibrillator, to make it as easily accessible, because it's not just you. It could be your neighbor, it could be your family, your friend, a person at work or school who might need it, "" Gupta said.  The nasal spray will come in a package of two 4-milligram doses, in case the person overdosing does not respond to the first dose. However, the drug's maker, Emergent BioSolutions, says most overdoses can be reversed with a single dose. The product could be given to anyone, even children and babies. The nasal spray is expected to be available for purchase in stores and online by late summer, Emergent said Wednesday.  More than a million dead from drug overdoses More than a million people have died of drug overdoses in the two decades since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began collecting that data. Many of those deaths were due to opioids. Deaths from opioid overdoses rose more than 17% in just one year, from about 69,000 in 2020 to about 81,020 in 2021, the CDC found. Opioid deaths are the leading cause of accidental death in the US. Most are among adults, but children are also dying, largely after ingesting synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Between 1999 and 2016, nearly 9,000 children and adolescents died of opioid poisoning, with the highest annual rates among adolescents 15 to 19, the CDC found. Nearly every state in the US has standing orders that allow pharmacists or other qualified organizations to provide the medication without a personal prescription to people who are at risk of an overdose or are helping someone at risk, but making it available over the counter can make it easier for people to access the opioid antidote.  Research shows that wider availability could save lives as opioid overdoses have skyrocketed in recent years -- much of it due to synthetic opioids like illicitly made fentanyl. Emergent President and CEO Robert Kramer hailed the FDA's decision as a ""historic milestone.""  ""We are dedicated to improving public health and assisting those working hard to end the opioid crisis -- so now with leaders across government, retail and advocacy groups, we must work together to continue increasing access and availability, as well as educate the public on the risks of opioid overdoses and the value of being prepared with Narcan Nasal Spray to help save a life,"" Kramer said in a statement. How naloxone works Narcan works by blocking the effects of opioids on the brain and restoring breathing. For the most effectiveness, it must be given as soon as signs of overdose appear. The drug works on someone only if there are opioids in their system. It won't work on any other type of drug overdose, but it won't have adverse effects if given to someone who hasn't taken opioids. Naloxone reverses an overdose for up to about 90 minutes, but opioids can stay in the system for longer, so it's still important to call 911 after giving the drug. People given naloxone should be watched carefully until medical help arrives and monitored for another two hours. Expanding access  About 1.2 million doses of naloxone were dispensed by retail pharmacies in 2021, according to data published by the American Medical Association -- nearly nine times more than were dispensed five years earlier.  Emergent said it does not have information on how much OTC Narcan will cost. Harm reduction experts say the price of naloxone has inhibited its accessibility to people who need it most. And although the cost will probably drop as it becomes available over the counter, they say it will probably still be out of reach for many. ""We're not going to be able to ramp up naloxone distribution in a game-changing way until we get a better handle on the price,"" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a scientist at the University of North Carolina's Injury Prevention Research Center who studies drugs and infectious diseases. ""There's the promise on paper versus on the street, and it's going to come down to the dollars and cents."" Separate changes to grant funding by both the CDC and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will make it easier for states and local health departments to buy naloxone, he said. Gupta said the Biden administration is asking the drugmakers to keep the price of the antidote low.   ""That's one of the things that the president has been very clear: that we've got to make sure that these life-saving medications, as well as treatment, is accessible across no matter where you live, rural or urban, rich or poor. We want to make sure this is accessible across broad swaths of people,"" he said. However, experts said the most meaningful work in the fight against the devastating outcomes of the drug overdose epidemic will come with ongoing emphasis on treatment for opioid use disorder and other harm-reduction strategies. ""While enabling people to access quality treatment for substance use disorders is critical, we must also acknowledge that people need to survive in order to have that choice,"" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in January.   Caleb Banta-Green, principal research scientist at the University of Washington's Addictions, Drug & Alcohol Institute, has described naloxone as the ""gateway drug"" to a conversation about what substance use disorder is. ""It's a conversation starter. It's life-saving for the individual. It's not a game-changer at the population level,"" he said. ""We need to do more. And we need to use treatment medications -- methadone and buprenorphine -- which are far higher overdose preventive approaches.""

                      Children who live with cats or dogs during fetal development and early infancy may be less likely than other kids to develop food allergies, according to a new study. The study, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, analyzed data from over 65,000 children from Japan. It found that children exposed to cats or indoor dogs had a 13% to 16% lower risk of all food allergies compared with babies in pet-free homes.  ""Our findings suggest that exposure to dogs and cats might be beneficial against the development of certain food allergies, thereby alleviating concerns about pet keeping and reducing the burden of food allergies,"" the authors wrote.  The study found that children exposed to cats were less likely to develop egg, wheat and soybean allergies, while those exposed to dogs were less likely to have egg, milk and nut allergies. Although there was no association between turtles and birds and food allergies, hamster exposure during fetal development was linked with nearly twice the risk of nut allergies. The authors speculate that nuts that hamsters consume may sensitize infants through physical contact or house dust.   The exact mechanism remains unclear, but experts say pet exposure may strengthen an infant's gut microbiome, either directly or indirectly though changes in the parent's or home microbiome. ""We know from a lot of studies that the microbiome -- which are the bacteria that live within us, thousands and millions of them inside everybody's gut -- affect our immune responses and our immune system, particularly whether we develop allergies or not,"" said Dr. Amal Assa'ad, director of the Food Allergy Program at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, who was not involved with the new research.  Dr. Jonathan Bernstein, president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, says dirt and other materials secreted by pets could be a good thing.   ""It is critical to have these exposures early on as the immune system is developing, as the gut is developing, because it does seem to be an important route for sensitization,"" said Bernstein, who was not involved with the study. Previous research has had mixed results. Some have linked pet exposure to decreased risk of food allergy, but others have found no association.  ""The data is all over the place,"" Assa'ad said. Although the researchers on the new study accounted for several factors that could influence the participant's risk of food allergy -- including mother's age, history of allergic disease, smoking status and place of residence -- they say it's possible that other factors influenced the results.    Additionally, food allergy data was self-reported, which relies on accurate diagnosis from participants, the researchers say.  ""There's a need to really confirm these types of studies,"" Bernstein said. ""So I wouldn't necessarily change lifestyles based on this data, but I wouldn't certainly get rid of pets in the home."" Experts hope these results can help guide research into the drivers behind childhood food allergies and reassure pet owners. ""If you're thinking about having an animal and you're concerned because you have allergies ... there may be an added benefit to having an animal, not just in terms of what it does for families and people's general love of pets, but also, it could be potentially protective if there's an early life exposure,"" Bernstein said.

                      What you need to know about the Marburg virus

                      The West African country of Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of the Marburg virus disease in mid-February. There have been at least nine laboratory-confirmed cases, seven of which resulted in death, and 20 probable cases of dead individuals in this outbreak, according to the World Health Organization. Now, authorities in Tanzania, in East Africa, have confirmed that country's first-ever case of the fatal disease. Health officials are investigating a total of eight cases, five of whom have died, and they have identified a total of 161 contacts who are being monitored. As most people know now from the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, a virus can spread from one country to another and hop from continent to continent through human transmission. In terms of infection, we are one community, which is why I turned to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen to ask about the Marburg virus. Wen is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health I asked about the disease's symptoms, what makes it so dangerous, how it is spread, whether there is a vaccine, and how the disease is treated. Finally, who should worry about the Marburg virus? CNN: What is the Marburg virus disease?  Dr. Leana Wen: The Marburg virus disease is caused by the Marburg virus, which is in the same family of viruses as the Ebola virus. Like Ebola, Marburg causes a severe hemorrhagic fever that impacts multiple organ systems and can include profuse bleeding, and affects both humans and nonhuman primates. The viral infection is a zoonotic disease, meaning that the origin of the disease is transmission from animals to humans. With previous outbreaks, fruit bats have been identified as the hosts of the Marburg virus, from which the virus is then transmitted to people. CNN: What are symptoms and what makes this disease so dangerous? Wen: Marburg virus disease is extremely deadly and is highly contagious when engaging in direct contact with an infected person. With previous outbreaks, case fatality rates have ranged from 24% to 88%, with an average fatality rate of around 50%. That means about half the people who contract the disease will die from it. Symptoms often start suddenly, with infected patients experiencing high fever, headache, muscle aches and malaise. It's also common to have abdominal pain and cramping and heavy watery diarrhea.  This disease, like Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever, in which infected individuals bleed from multiple orifices. Externally, patients might bleed from the nose, gums and eyes, and internal bleeding manifests as blood in vomit, urine and stool. Severe blood loss can cause shock and death. The incubation period — the period from infection to the start of symptoms — is as short as two days to as long as three weeks. Most symptoms start within a week, with death occurring between eight and nine days after initial symptoms. CNN: How is the Marburg virus spread? Wen: Similar to Ebola, Marburg is spread via direct person-to-person contact. That includes contact with blood or other bodily fluids or objects contaminated with the bodily fluids of an infected person — such as bedding, clothing, needles and other medical equipment. Some cases have also been documented in which semen from a man who has recovered from Marburg has resulted in transmission to his partners.  Those most at risk of Marburg are people in direct contact with infected individuals. That includes family members, caregivers and health care workers. Individuals with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should be placed in isolation. Those caring for them should wear protective gowns, gloves and masks to prevent direct physical contact with the patient. CNN: Is there a vaccine? How is Marburg virus disease treated? Wen: No vaccine has been developed against the Marburg virus, though there is an experimental vaccine and other vaccine candidates. There is no specific antiviral treatment. Infected patients are treated with symptomatic and supportive therapies, meaning that they would get fluids, oxygen and blood transfusions as necessary. CNN: Who should worry about the Marburg virus? Wen: At this time, cases of the Marburg virus disease have been found in just the two countries, Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania. Efforts are underway to contain these outbreaks. Successful containment has occurred in the past. Marburg is not a new disease — it was detected in 1967 after simultaneous outbreaks in Germany and Serbia. Numerous outbreaks have occurred since, including in Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo and most recently, in 2022, in Ghana.  Though the Marburg virus causes severe disease, there are ways to contain it. Individuals transmitting it to others are generally symptomatic. In addition, the Marburg virus is not an airborne virus. That makes it easier to control compared with Covid-19, which is often transmitted by people who are not exhibiting symptoms and is so contagious that it does not require direct contact and can be carried on microscopic aerosols.  The two Marburg outbreaks in West and East Africa must be monitored closely. Health care workers in these regions should be on high alert, and efforts to test a vaccine and treatments should be expedited. At this time, there is no need for most of the world to worry about the danger of Marburg infection. However, the Marburg virus is yet another reminder of the many zoonotic pathogens that are capable of causing severe harm to human health.

                      Guns are the leading cause of death for US children and teens, since surpassing car accidents in 2020.  Firearms accounted for nearly 19% of childhood deaths (ages 1-18) in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder database. Nearly 3,600 children died in gun-related incidents that year. That's about five children lost for every 100,000 children in the United States. In no other comparable country are firearms within the top four causes of mortality among children, according to a KFF analysis. The shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville on Monday, marks the 16th shooting this year in grades K-12 and the deadliest since the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year, according to a CNN analysis of school shooting data. Six people — three children and three adults — were killed. There have been 130 mass shootings so far in 2023, the highest number of shootings recorded at this point in any year since at least 2013, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. Child and teen mortality overall surged during the Covid-19 pandemic — driven not by Covid-19 deaths but by fatal injuries, according to a new study in JAMA. Firearms accounted for nearly half of the increase in mortality in 2020.

                      The World Health Organization's vaccine experts have revised their global Covid-19 vaccination recommendations, and healthy kids and teenagers considered low priority may not need to get a shot.  The updated roadmap is designed to prioritize Covid-19 vaccines for those at greatest risk of death and severe disease, according to the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). It is being issued to reflect the Omicron stage of the pandemic and because of countries' high population immunity levels due to vaccines and infection, the group announced following a recent meeting.  The new streamlined recommendations focus on high-, medium- and low-risk groups. SAGE recommends additional booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine for high-priority groups such as older people, immunocompromised people of all ages, front-line health workers and pregnant people six or 12 months after their last booster dose.   For those at medium risk, the group recommends primary vaccinations and first booster doses but does not recommend routine additional boosters. This group includes children and adolescents with health risks and healthy adults under the age of about 60. For healthy kids six months to 17 years old, the group said countries should consider vaccinating based on factors such as disease burden and cost-effectiveness.  ""The public health impact of vaccinating healthy children and adolescents is comparatively much lower than the established benefits of traditional essential vaccines for children -- such as the rotavirus, measles, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines,"" SAGE said in a press release.  The group said its vaccine guidance is based on current epidemiological conditions and could change if the pandemic evolves. It also comes as countries are making their own choices about vaccine recommendations based on their vaccine supply and progress.  US officials, for example, are weighing whether to offer people who are at high risk of severe Covid-19 the chance to get another bivalent booster. The United Kingdom and Canada have already begun allowing certain people to get another bivalent booster. Experts also acknowledged competing health priorities when it comes to vaccinations. ""As we all know, the Covid pandemic has taken a heavy toll on immunization programs,"" SAGE Chair Dr. Hanna Nohynek said on Tuesday.  ""It's been a tremendous effort, and many countries have done very well reaching high coverages, but it is still requiring efforts to reduce the inequities, and we need to reach the high-priority groups, and we need to close the coverage gaps."" Nohynek said there was a need for children to catch up on routine vaccines they missed during the Covid-19 pandemic. She pointed to rising cases of measles across all of WHO's regions, saying that immunization programs around the world must be strengthened and restored. Measles is a known ""tracer,"" or a sign that other vaccine-preventable diseases are in communities. Polio is also circulating in several countries, so WHO's vaccine advisers recommend improving immune vaccine coverage and supplementing with a dose of injectable polio vaccine when there is ""persistent poliovirus circulation.""

                      FDA sketches out plan to bolster fragile US infant formula supply management
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/28/health/fda-formula-hearing/index.html,"
                      Mar 28, 2023
                    ","
                      The US Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday its initial strategy to boost and strengthen the management of the country's supply of infant formula. The announcement came just ahead of a hearing of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about what went wrong during last year's infant formula shortage.  Committee members and experts who testified were critical of formula makers and the FDA's food safety program, which the agency has pledged to revamp in order to protect the nation's food supply and promote better nutrition. Many experts are concerned that the formula shortage of 2022 could easily happen again, even with those changes. ""While we stand here today, more than a year since the recall, it is my view that the state of the infant formula industry today is not much different than it was then,"" testified Frank Yiannas, who stepped down from his role as the agency's deputy commissioner of food policy and response in late February.  ""The nation remains one outbreak, one tornado, flood or cyberattack away from finding itself in a similar place to that of February 17, 2022.""  A formula shortage that started in 2021 was exacerbated when the United States' largest infant formula maker, Abbott Nutrition, recalled multiple products in mid-February and had to pause production after FDA inspectors found potentially dangerous bacteria at its Sturgis, Michigan, plant.  A former Abbott employee filed a whistleblower complaint about the plant with the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in February 2021. The complaint suggested that the plant lacked proper cleaning practices and that workers falsified records and hid information from inspectors.  The complaint was filed February 16, 2021, and was passed on to Abbott and the FDA three days later. Yiannas testified that because of the siloed nature of the agency, he wasn't made aware of the complaint until February 2022. It was only then that he learned that children had gotten sick with Cronobacter after consuming powdered formula made at the plant.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated at least four illnesses and two deaths in three states in connection. The agency sequenced bacteria from two of the children to compare against the samples the FDA took at the facility, but it did not find that the samples were closely related.  Abbott said in a statement Tuesday that ""the quality and safety of our products is always a priority -- and it's important to remember that no sealed, distributed product from our Sturgis, Mich., facility tested positive for the presence of Cronobacter."" ""As part of Abbott's quality processes, samples from every batch of powdered infant formula products are tested for Cronobacter, and they must test negative before any product is released,"" the company said. Yiannas said at the hearing that manufacturing runs are tested in such a way that it would not necessarily catch all contamination. Cronobacter infections are rare but can be serious and even fatal, especially in newborns. The bacteria lives in the environment, but when these infections are diagnosed in infants, they are often linked to powdered formula. ""Clearly, I really wish, and I should have been notified sooner, so I could have initiated containment steps earlier. Had that happened, I believe we might not be here today,"" Yiannas said Tuesday. ""Had the agency responded quicker to some of the earlier signals, I believe this crisis could have been averted or at least the magnitude lessened."" With more demand for other brands after the Abbott recalls, families across the country had to hunt through multiple stores for formula last year. Stock rates of baby formula stayed lower than they were the year before for much of 2022. Even in October, when rates had improved, nearly a third of households with a baby younger than 1 said they had trouble finding formula over the course of one week, according to a survey by the US Census Bureau. The FDA said Tuesday that its new national strategy helps ensure that the country's supply of formula will remain constant and safe.  The agency said it will work with the industry on redundancy risk management plans that will help companies identify possible supply chain problems. It will also continue to enhance inspections of infant formula plants by expanding and improving training for agency investigators.  According to the strategy, the FDA will expedite review of premarket submissions for new products to prevent shortages. It will continue to closely monitor the formula supply and has developed a model to forecast any potential disruptions.  It also plans to work closely with the US Department of Agriculture to build in more resiliency with its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children program, or WIC, the nation's largest purchaser of infant formula. The new strategy is just a first step; the long-term strategy is expected to be released in early 2024. Dr. Susan Mayne, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a statement that the new strategy aims to incentivize ""additional infant formula manufacturers to enter the market."" Many parts of the strategy are underway, the FDA said. ""Safety and supply go hand-in-hand. We witnessed last year how a safety concern at one facility could be the catalyst for a nationwide shortage. That's why we are looking to both strengthen and diversify the market, while also ensuring that manufacturers are producing infant formula under the safest conditions possible,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a news release. ""Now, with this strategy, we are looking at how to advance long-term stability in this market and mitigate future shortages, while ensuring formula is safe."" Formula stock rates are still not where they once were before last year's crisis, Yiannas said, but the problem can't be solved overnight. He said it was a good step for Congress to ask for a resiliency report from the industry. One positive development that came out of the crisis is that manufacturers are reporting formula volume to the FDA on a weekly basis even though there is no legal requirement to do so, he said.  Historically, the FDA has focused on food safety and nutrition, not supply chain availability, but the Covid-19 pandemic opened eyes and served as the ""biggest test on the US food system in 100 years,"" Yiannas said. Food supply shortages made experts realize that the agency needed more intelligence on how companies' supply chains worked.  ""Progress is being made, but it's not being made fast enough,"" Yiannas said. The FDA is now tracking sales and stock rates of baby formula. He said he's talked to formula companies that say they have ramped up production, even though they might have cut back on the number of varieties of product they offer.  Abbott said in its statement Tuesday that it is running its US facilities at increased capacity and is importing additional formula from Europe to meet US needs. It is also building a new $500 million plant in the US. The FDA said Tuesday that it has also done a study to better understand what led to the recall of infant formula at the Abbott plant. The agency had conducted a routine surveillance inspection at the plant in September 2021 and even then found problems like standing water and inadequate handwashing among employees.  Abbott is facing additional investigations from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Federal Trade Commission and the US Department of Justice as well as lawsuits from customers. Yiannas told the House committee Tuesday that one strategy to head off similar shutdowns would be to require manufacturers to report Cronobacter bacteria found in its products. Currently, only the Abbott plant in Michigan is required to report the bacteria as part of the consent decree that allowed it to reopen. The FDA said in November that it would like Cronobacter infections added to the CDC's list of national notifiable diseases, which would require doctors to report cases to public health officials so the CDC and the FDA could keep better track of infections. Only two states have such a reporting requirement now.

                      One of the most memorable lectures during my first year of medical school at the University of Michigan was delivered by Dr. Julian ""Buz"" Hoff. He was the chair of neurosurgery and a master at teaching the natural history of brain diseases. We learned about brain tumors, vascular diseases and trauma.  Hoff had a way of explaining things that made them really stick, and that was particularly clear in his lecture called ""GSW."" Anyone who works in a hospital probably knows that the acronym GSW stands for ""gunshot wound,"" and the way Hoff wanted us to learn the topic was for us see the impact firsthand. So on the last day of his class, we went to an outdoor gun range in Ann Arbor for our GSW lecture. There were handguns there, as well as rifles. In the distance, I saw several watermelons on top of old barrels that would serve as targets. After putting in his ear plugs and donning safety glasses, Hoff shot a watermelon with a handgun. I saw the bullet hit the watermelon but wasn't confident I saw the bullet exit. The watermelon was then brought to us for inspection.  First thing to notice, he told us: There was an obvious entrance and exit ""wound,"" and they were around the same size. We could see the green skin folding in on itself around the entrance wound and the outward beveled tissue around the exit. After we chopped the watermelon open, he pointed out that the bullet seemed to have traveled in a fairly predictable trajectory, a linear bullet-sized line through the body of the watermelon. Next came the same demonstration with a rifle. This time, I saw the watermelon shudder as it was struck and then immediately saw a significant amount of red tissue fly out the backside. Upon inspection, the first thing I noticed was how much bigger the exit wound was, compared with the entrance. And after opening the watermelon, the purpose of the demonstration became clear: Instead of a predictable linear track, the watermelon looked like it had been cored out and what was left was shredded. He explained that this was a phenomenon known as cavitation, which is just what it sounds like: The bullet doesn't simply travel through the body, it creates a big cavity inside it.  The message was clear: I want you to imagine that had been a human body.  Much in the way pictures of black lungs had left an indelible impression of smoking on all medical students, Hoff had done the same with me for GSWs. I was reflecting on that demonstration recently when I operated on a patient with a GSW to the head. It was a handgun injury, and we were able to quickly control the bleeding and relieve the pressure on the brain. The patient spent one day in the ICU for observation and was discharged a few days later. Had it been a rifle injury, there was hardly any chance he would've survived.  With guns front and center yet again with the recent shooting in Nashville, I wanted to share what I have learned over the years about what bullets do to the human body and the challenge it is for surgeons to repair the damage. More damage Nearly 30 years after my med school gun range demonstration, Dr. Ernest E. Moore, trauma surgeon and director of trauma research at the Shock Trauma Center named after him at Denver Health, is also using the watermelon example to draw a comparison between different firearms.  ""I often use the analogy that the injury to the liver [with a semi-automatic rifle] would be similar to just taking a watermelon and dropping it on the cement. It's incredible the amount of energy delivered. ... By comparison, the 9 millimeter would drill a hole through the liver. So you'd have a sizable hole, but if you didn't hit a major blood vessel, it's a pretty tolerable injury. In fact, we in civilian trauma will often manage a 9-millimeter liver injury without an operation, whereas a patient with an assault rifle would be dead within 20 minutes if you didn't operate,"" he said. Other human tissue in the body reacts differently. ""If you struck a bone with an AR-15, like your femur in your leg, it would literally shatter into multiple fragments that would sort of serve as secondary missiles. Whereas ... we've seen 9 millimeters that will actually drill a hole right to the femur,"" he said. (An AR-15 is a lightweight semi-automatic -- that is, self-loading -- rifle manufactured by Colt; other gunmakers make rifles in a similar style.)  Moore also brings up cavitation as a way of visualizing what is happening in the body. He describes cavitation ""as the result of a rapid expansion of the tissues surrounding the path of the bullet. ... In essence, instead of a virtual drill hole with a 9 millimeter, your path of injury in tissue with an AR-15 will be 6 inches wide. And the path beyond that is even wider, but the tissue recoils back into it,"" said Moore, noting that inelastic tissue -- like the liver, heart and brain -- are the most vulnerable to this type of energy. A brief history of the AR-15-style weapon Although the Department of Justice noted last year that 77.2% of mass shootings -- which it counts as four or more deaths, excluding the shooter -- involve handguns, many of the highest-profile incidents involved assault-style rifles: the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; Orlando's Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016; the 2017 shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas; and the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida; the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, and the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, just to name a few.  This kind of rifle unleashes a lot of power, said Moore, who, in addition to being a trauma surgeon since 1976 (who operated on some of the Columbine survivors), co-edited a major textbook on trauma surgery, authored more than 1,700 scientific articles and was the longtime editor of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. ""The capacity for tissue injury is reflected in the so-called kinetic energy. And the kinetic energy, simplistically, is the mass or weight of the bullet times the velocity squared. So the velocity -- the speed of the bullet exiting the gun -- is really its primary effectiveness,"" he said. Moore said a 9-millimeter handgun has a muzzle energy -- the kinetic energy of a bullet as it leaves the gun's muzzle -- of roughly 400 foot-pounds of force. For a rifle like the AR-15, that number is 1,300. ""So you have a huge increase in the amount of energy imparted from the gun,"" he explained. He said the size of the bullet has less to do with the damage it causes. ""I think there are some misconceptions with ... rifles. A lot of people say, 'Oh, they're big bullets.' Actually, they're small bullets -- interestingly, they're even smaller than many handguns. So the actual bullet that's discharged from an AR-15, for example, is a half the size of the bullet from a 9 millimeter. The difference is the ... velocity,"" he said.  And, if that rifle is a semi-automatic weapon, the weapon can be fired repeatedly, without manually reloading, simply by pulling the trigger. In Uvalde, hundreds of rounds were fired into classrooms in the first four minutes, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw.  Moore, who grew up in a hunting family, owns firearms and is an avid hunter, has been outspoken in his opposition to civilians owning AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons and does not own one himself.  ""The rifle that our military uses to fight our enemies is the same rifle that we allow civilians access to and can create these mass shootings,"" he said.   An Emmett Till moment During my neurosurgery training and the first several years of my career, I didn't encounter these sorts of injuries. That's because between 1994 and 2004, certain semi-automatic firearms were banned. In fact, it was in 2003, while I was covering the war in Iraq, that I first saw the damage these weapons cause on the human body, not just a watermelon.  I was embedded with the Devil Docs, the Navy medical team that provides front-line medical care for the Marines. There are things that my cameraman Mark Biello and I saw on the battlefield that we still have a hard time talking about. They are still hard to even write about. Limbs blown clean off the body and wounds so horrific, I thought for sure they must've been caused by a bomb or IED.  I never imagined that just a couple of years later, I would see the same sorts of injuries in US cities, including my own, Atlanta. Those are the days when I come home from the hospital simply unable to talk, let alone describe what I had just witnessed.  Still, as you may have read after the tragedy in Uvalde last year, some folks raised whether we should have an ""Emmett Till moment.""  Emmett Till was a 14-year-old Black teen who was abducted and violently murdered in 1955 by white racists in Mississippi after a white woman accused him of whistling at her. Till's mother took the unusual step of holding an open-casket funeral and allowing a photographer from Jet magazine to photograph her son's disfigured, unrecognizable face to show the country the result of racial violence. Many consider that moment a turning point in the country's collective support for the civil rights movement. Many of my colleagues have urged me to further describe the horrific injuries I have seen over the last nearly 20 years as a neurotrauma surgeon.  The truth is, I'm not sure America is ready to see that. More important, it isn't a decision anybody can make unless it's their loss and their story to tell -- like Emmett Till's mother. Public health emergency Louis Klarevas, research professor at Columbia University and author of the 2016 book ""Rampage Nation,"" credits the 10-year federal assault weapons ban between 1994 and 2004 with significantly reducing the number of mass shooting incidents and deaths (which he defined as injuring or killing six or more people) before rebounding to even higher levels after the ban expired. In 2020, there were an estimated 20 million AR-15 style weapons in circulation in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Between 1990 and 1999, during the decade in which I traveled to that gun range with Hoff, mass shootings claimed an average of 21 lives per year; from 2012 to 2021, that average had gone up to 51, according to the Violence Project. It defines a mass shooting as four or more people in a public place being killed with firearms, without any underlying criminal activity, excluding the shooter. (CNN defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people other than the shooter are injured or killed by gunfire during one event.)  Federal data on the overall impact of gun violence is lacking. Even obtaining the basic numbers can be a challenge, as I learned writing this article. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dashboards for Covid-19 and mpox, gun violence

                      The biotech company BTNX says it is shipping out new test strips this week that detect the presence of xylazine, an animal sedative that officials say is increasingly being mixed with fentanyl. As with fentanyl test strips, these pieces of paper have a reagent that can help users detect whether a drug has any xylaxine in it. Commonly called ""tranq"" or ""tranq dope,"" xylazine has not been approved for human use. The drug has heavy sedative effects like an opioid but isn't one, so it doesn't respond to the opioid overdose antidote, naloxone, also known as Narcan. Fentanyl is a fast-acting opioid, and users say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high. However, the drug is also associated with severe soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. The US Drug Enforcement Administration issued a public health alert this month noting that xylazine is widespread and has been detected in about 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pill seizures. The test strips cost $2 each and are sold in boxes of 100, BTNX marketing manager Molly McKay said in an email to CNN. The strips are inserted into a mixture of water and the drug to be tested, and they return a positive result when xylazine is present. However, they cannot test for quantity or potency of the drug. A study published last week by the City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health found the test strips to be highly sensitive and said they gave false results only when lidocaine was also present in the drug mixture.                                                                                                                                                                               This kind of drug testing or drug checking is a way of making drug use safer that's commonly known as harm reduction.  Instead of demanding complete abstinence, harm reduction takes mitigation steps to keep users safe, like improving access to clean needles and naloxone.

                      What someone with an eating disorder wishes you knew

                      Getting diagnosed with an eating disorder happened by accident to Emily Boring.  She went to her university's mental health office to talk about anxiety she was feeling, and through conversations learned that her behaviors with food were classified as an eating disorder, she said. Now 27 and a graduate student at the Yale Divinity School in New Haven, Connecticut, her journey of recovery and relapse has taught her a lot about how to care for herself and others, she said.  During Eating Disorders Awareness Week in late February, Boring spoke to CNN about the misunderstanding, shame and stigma around eating disorders so they can be better understood.  This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.  CNN: What do you want people to know about disordered eating and eating disorders? Emily Boring: I wish people knew that it is everywhere. The vast majority of people will experience some kind of disordered relationship to food in their bodies, simply because of the culture we live in. What I would say first and foremost is disordered eating — and this also applies to formal eating disorders — don't look a certain way. They affect everyone regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status. Disordered eating and eating disorders do not come with a ""thin"" or underweight body. CNN: How do you understand eating disorders and treatment? Boring: Eating disorders are now classified as metabo-psychiatric illnesses — metabolism referring to the way the body processes energy, and then the psychiatric portion related to brain and behavior.  This has confirmed the experience of people with eating disorders. We for decades — and clinicians also — have noticed that eating disorders tend to be activated when someone falls into energy deficit or doesn't take in enough calories to support their body.  Eating disorders are not shameful. They're not a choice, and they're not a failure. There's still some lingering stigma around the thought that eating disorders are something that you choose. I would add on to that: if someone is on the precipice of realizing they have an eating disorder or receiving that diagnosis from someone else, I would stress the importance of early intervention. And I would say that the first step to recovery is finding a really good eating disorder team (including a) therapist, dietician and a doctor.  CNN: How should loved ones talk to people in recovery from eating disorders? Boring: I do speak mostly from my own experience, but I've also mentored quite a few teenagers during this process. I've learned the hard way what isn't helpful to say to them, and I've also been the recipient (of unhelpful comments).  To the extent that you can, avoid comments and actions that we associate with diet culture. Especially in this country, the way that we privilege fitness in popular culture is antithetical to recovery. Diet culture oftentimes hides beneath the banner of healthism — that's basically the belief that there is a standard of fitness and able-bodiedness that everyone can attain if we just work hard.  There's a whole body of literature — scientific literature showing that health and weight are not all causally related. So higher weight doesn't necessarily equal poor health outcome.  CNN: What do you mean when you say not to use ""the eating disorder's own voice"" to talk back to it? Boring: Let's say I show up in a doctor's office, and I'm afraid of what's happening to my body. I'm afraid I'm going to gain weight. And a clinician may say well meaningly, ""Don't worry, your body's not going to change that much. Your weight doesn't have to go higher."" Regardless of the factualness of that statement or not, that's just playing right into the eating disorder's belief.  It's so easy to try to reassure (your loved one) using the eating disorder's own language, and I found that that just really doesn't work in the long run. CNN: What are ways to talk to people without using the voice of the eating disorder? Boring: Some questions that I encourage folks to ask themselves are things like, ""Is what I'm about to say implying that some bodies are better than other bodies? Or that some foods have greater or lesser moral worth?"" Also try to avoid mentioning anything with numbers, whether that is weight or calories or number of hours exercising per week.  Don't assume someone's inner state based on how they do or don't look on the outside. As much as people can, step back and ask questions, instead of making an assumption. An example: ""I see that you're improving in these behaviors, like we set the goal of last week. How's that feeling to you? How was your mind reacting?"" So that process of gentle inquiry rather than statements and assumptions is really key. CNN: What do people need to know about relapse? Boring: That it is not a failure, and that doesn't have to lead you back to the worst of illness that you've ever experienced. You can catch it early, and you can turn things around.  What I wish that I had known about relapse is that it happens more quickly and more sudden and all consumingly than I thought.  If you're someone who has the genes for an eating disorder — whether that's anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating disorder, any (disease) on the spectrum — you're probably always going to have to be careful and vigilant about maintaining nutrition, eating an abundance and variety of foods, insulating yourself from diet culture. Because it can happen fast — a few days of restriction, a few lost pounds and all of a sudden, you're back fully in the eating disorder.  And I would also say that relapse is a learning opportunity. It doesn't always feel like that in the moment, but the times that I've relapsed, I look back and I realized in each instance, I've discovered something about what recovery means to me.   I guess that's just a way to say, be gentle with yourself and be open-minded that yes, relapse is a crisis, and you need to do everything you can to get out of it. But also, it's not a failure and it's not a sign that you'll be struggling with this forever. CNN: What have you learned about recovery? Boring: When I first started recovering, people — mostly clinicians, but also on some of the books and blogs that I'd read from people who've recovered — frame recovery, mostly in terms of absence. When you're recovered, you won't have these troubling symptoms anymore, or you won't spend so much time thinking about food in your body.  In reality, what it's like to be recovered is completely about presence. It is an ability to be present to relationships around you to the things that you're interested in. It's also just a physical presence of awareness of your own body, ability to perceive sensations, ability to eventually listen to your body's cues of hunger and fullness.  The eating disorder is completely gray, and it feels like I'm kind of dragging myself through the days. ... When I'm recovered, the world comes back into color again.

                      What one millennial with phone anxiety did when she stopped texting to stay connected

                      Some of my earliest memories from growing up in the late 1980s were of my mom spending hours on the phone with my grandmother, my aunt and her best friends.  There was a daily circuit of female communication that kicked off sometime right after breakfast. Between the daily advice doled out by television hosts Oprah and Phil Donahue, there were regular check-ins, gossip fests and venting sessions.  I definitely didn't follow in her (dialing) footsteps. As a proud elder millennial, I fully embraced text culture in my early 20s.  Unless there was a life-threatening emergency or someone had died, a casual text was enough. It felt considerate. Familiar. Direct. For decades, I did my best communicating via a keyboard.  Then the pandemic took over, and my world closed in. As many Americans stayed home in 2020, my circle became impossibly small. Even as a card-carrying introvert, I realized I missed the sound of someone's voice — and one voice in particular — my mom's.  That's when I picked up the phone. And what I found was a wealth of simple comfort that had always been waiting on the other end of the proverbial phone line. Week after week during the height of the pandemic, hearing my mom's voice made me feel less lonely.  How often, when feeling poorly, even as adults, do we wish for Mom to take care of us? The pandemic made physical contact nearly impossible, but I still felt cared for through our conversations. The power of my mom's comforting voice is backed up by research. A 2021 study found that ""Although e-mail and other text-based media can be excellent for scheduling meetings and sending spreadsheets, connecting with others is better done using one's voice.""  Finding a sense of shared well-being through conversations that forge strong bonds can be especially true for women. ""When women feel socially connected and supported, they are not only better equipped to cope with challenges, pursue their goals, and enjoy a higher quality of life, but also to improve the lives of everyone they are connected with,"" said Kristjan Archer, a senior communications consultant at Gallup, in a March 8 blog post. Most US women —  72%, in fact — often find some of that connection speaking on the phone, according to the accompanying Gallup poll. I discovered many benefits of voice-to-voice contact, especially when it came to connecting with my parents and older relatives, most of whom were born in the 1960s or earlier. Those of us born in the 1980s and later are fluent in communicating our emotions via text characters, but that's not always true of our elders.  The pandemic made me see the value of my mom and dad's way of doing things. Tone and intent come across so much more clearly when we're talking on the phone. I needed to know — especially then — how my parents were doing. And even now, I want to hear it in their voices.  Tone is especially lost in texting. How often are relationships severed or at least damaged over a text miscommunication? Someone is trying to be funny or sarcastic, and the little emoji they've snuck in at the end of their text doesn't convey their emotion properly, and suddenly Aunt Margaret's side of the family has decided to skip your Thanksgiving celebration this year.  There is also the benefit of a wandering conversation. During lockdown in particular, we had nothing but time. If you have the luxury of time, letting a conversation meander can be a beautiful thing. I learned so much about my parents, our family history, silly stories from my childhood and things that surprised me during our phone chats.  During one summer phone call, my dad, a Vietnam veteran who has never wanted to discuss his experience there, found out from my mom that I'd been binge-watching Ken Burns' docuseries ""The Vietnam War,"" and jumped on the phone to discuss it with me. For the first time in my memory, my dad shared anecdotes from his time in the US Navy aboard the aircraft carrier where he spent the war.   I started saving up stories to share on our weekly calls and making notes of questions to ask later. And I started to schedule more phone calls with my siblings and close friends who live in different states, sometimes video chatting so I could see the speaker's face.  I've even started speaking with my author friends, a group of people who have long preferred email and text. I realized just how good it felt to hear their voices and to really know if they were emotional or happy or uncomfortable or even lonely. Walking while talking I also found I could easily fit in phone calls during my weekly routine. I started putting in my earbuds and calling my mom while we were both on walks. I'd call my sister when I was in my car on my way somewhere. I called my best friend while cleaning the house and my writing critique partner while painting my nails. (I couldn't type and walk or drive or dust, so this new development was a win.) I may be making the switch sound as if it was an easy transition, but I had phone anxiety and it took practice. I loved making appointments and reservations online because I didn't have to talk to anyone. And when my phone rang, no matter who it was, spam or relative, I would freeze up.  But when I started practicing, I got better at it. Here's how I did it.  How to practice phone calls Start with strangers. Scheduling doctor's appointments, calling your kid's school and ordering takeout are all instances where the other person is supposed to be patient and professional with you. You aren't an inconvenience calling the restaurant down the street because you are contributing to its business. Take a deep breath, make sure you have a notepad and pen within reach, and make the call. Write it down. Here's a tip straight from my 12-year-old, who tends to feels nervous ordering aloud at restaurants: She writes her order down, verbatim, to read aloud when the server asks. If you have to make an appointment, write down what you need, when you're available and so forth. In fact, I used to write down my character's names when I would take calls about my books because when I'm nervous I forget everything I've ever known.  Schedule your calls in advance. Sometimes I make a standing phone call, like with my mom. Sometimes the minute I get off the phone, I email or text the person and say, ""When should we talk next week/month/whatever?"" It eases my mind to know the person I am calling expects me and has dedicated time to speak with me, and that can go both ways. Be honest. I was honest with myself and the people I was talking to. I explained that I'm rusty on phone calls but wanted to make a concerted effort to be more present and keep in touch. I found if I was willing to make the effort, they were often willing to do the same. That's the thing about talking on the phone. They can hear how much I meant it.

                      Government to step up efforts to monitor health of East Palestine residents, first responders
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/health/east-palestine-health-testing/index.html,"

                      Almost two months after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in the town of East Palestine, Ohio, the state Department of Health is preparing to offer blood and urine testing and physical exams to first responders who rushed to fight the blaze.  The testing is set to start within the next two weeks and will be the first step in a long-term effort to monitor the health of responders to the accident, according to an email obtained by CNN.   This move closely follows an announcement that a health assessment clinic for East Palestine residents that has been operating out of a local church will become permanent and expand its services. Roughly 300 firefighters from 50 departments -- many of whom were volunteers -- responded to the derailment and fire, which happened the night of February 3 and continued to burn for several days.  Many of the firefighters had their gear ruined by the heat and chemicals. Some wore breathing apparatus to protect themselves from the fumes and smoke, but others didn't have or didn't know that they needed self-contained breathing apparatus to protect their lungs and airways, according to firefighters who were at the scene and spoke with CNN. The email about health testing, which was sent to area fire chiefs Sunday, says the long-term monitoring plans for the first responders are still being developed, but a first step will be the physicals, which will include ""blood work, urinalysis, and an exam."" It does not describe what the tests will look for or their purpose. The Ohio Department of Public Health said in a statement Monday that it ""has been working with the East Palestine fire chief to make sure responders' unique needs are addressed. ""In early March, ODH began soliciting first responders to voluntarily fill out a specialized After Chemical Exposure (ACE) survey, and more than 200 have filled those out so far. This collects information on type of exposure and PPE worn as well as any health impacts responders may be experiencing,"" the statement says. ""The next step in our comprehensive plan of ongoing monitoring of first responders involves creating a clinical service within the next several weeks. This service is in the planning stages and many details still have not been determined, but it would include voluntary laboratory testing."" In addition to the testing through the health department, firefighters who responded to the derailment will be followed by the Firefighter Cancer Cohort Study, Candice McDonald, deputy chief executive of the National Volunteer Fire Council, said Monday. The study, which is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, aims to follow 10,000 firefighters for 30 years to learn more about how their exposures contribute to cancer risks. Cancer caused by chemicals in smoke is the leading cause of death for firefighters, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters. First responders to the Ohio derailment were among the most heavily exposed to a cocktail of chemicals that spilled into the ground and nearby creeks. David Comstock, chief of the Western Reserve Joint Fire District, says there are still a lot of unknowns about the nature of the chemical hazards that the firefighters were exposed to that night. ""One of the things that I've raised is, what's in tank car A? And what's in tank car B? But what happens when they mix and burn? Now, what do I have?"" he said.   Comstock says that three firefighters from his station responded to the derailment and were 50 to 100 feet from a burning railcar. He asked them what was in the derailed cars, ""and my crews couldn't answer me,"" he said. It was hard to get information about the chemicals on the scene, he said.   He arranged physical exams for the firefighters at his station within a week, but he wishes they had happened even faster. He spoke to some doctors who advised blood testing within 48 hours. ""Your blood, your body, processes many of the chemicals out of it within that time period, that they don't become detectable at that point,"" he said.  It's unclear how much information testing will yield now, Comstock said, but he hopes the exams and tests from the Department of Health will offer a baseline so the first responders will know if their health changes over time. East Palestine residents will also soon get expanded access to health services.  The temporary health assessment clinic that opened in downtown in the wake of the train derailment will remain open permanently, Gov. Mike DeWine testified Wednesday before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.   ""We started back clinic shortly after this tragedy occurred. This morning ... I met with medical leaders from the East Liverpool City Hospital. And we are announcing today that we'll be making this clinic into a permanent clinic for the community,"" DeWine said last week. ""This is going to be a full-service clinic that will provide comprehensive care and treatment. Anybody can walk in anyone can be treated. And this is a long-term commitment to the health of the people of East Palestine,"" said DeWine, who offered his testimony remotely, from the library of East Palestine High School. DeWine gave few details on the services that might be available to the clinic or who would ultimately pay for them. Currently, residents can walk into the clinic to get information about their risk, answer questions as part of an ongoing health study, and meet with a physician to get a basic exam and advice on any necessary follow-up care. DeWine suggested that these offerings might be expanded under a partnership with East Liverpool City Hospital.  His comments were also an acknowledgment of ongoing health needs in the community. East Palestine residents are ""worried about their future they're worried about where things are going to be in five or 10 or 15 years. It's important that they be able to continue to get assessed,"" he said.   DeWine said it would be particularly important for the health of the first responders to continue to have regular checkups. ""They all need to be assessed. That needs to be established -- a baseline -- and they need to be assured that in five years or 10 years, there's still a place where they can go."" DeWine said Norfolk Southern would be expected to pay for those things. ""We look to the railroad to establish that fund,"" he said.

                      Good friends and good physical health may be even more closely linked than previously thought, new research has found. Researchers discovered that positive social experiences impact not only a person's stress level and ability to cope, but also markers of physical health, according to a study published Monday in the journal Society for Personality and Social Psychology. The study followed more than 4,000 people over three weeks as they completed check-ins every three days on their smartphones or smartwatches regarding their positive and negative experiences with their closest social relationships, as well as assessments of their blood pressure, heart rate, stress and coping. Having more positive experiences in social relationships was generally associated with better coping, lower stress and lower systolic blood pressure, or spikes in blood pressure under stress, according to the study.  But having social relationships which bounce between good and bad often can be unhelpful. When there is a lot of volatility, the negative experiences seemed to have a bigger impact on a person than the positive, said lead study author Brian Don of the University of Auckland.  ""Both positive and negative experiences in our relationships contribute to our daily stress, coping, and physiology,"" Don said in a statement. ""Additionally, it's not just how we feel about our relationships overall that matters; the up's and downs are important too."" The results are not surprising, given that previous studies have also documented a link between healthy relationships and healthier bodies, said Dr. Kathleen Mullan Harris, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Harris was not involved in the study. But seeing how friendships affect specific aspects of physical health does add to the scientific understanding of the connection, she said.  The research, which took place from 2019 to the end of 2021, may also offer insight into the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, which put strain on social relationships for many people, Don said.  ""Because the COVID-19 pandemic has created considerable strain, turbulence, and variability in people's relationships, it may indirectly alter stress, coping, and physiology in daily life, all of which have important implications for physical well-being,"" he added. Do good friendships lead to better health? It is important to remember that the study cannot prove that good relationships cause better health, Don said.  But it does show that physical health and social relationships are often intertwined, he said. And the association can also work the other way, Harris said. ""People who are in better health often have better relationships with people, because they're not moody, they're not grouchy, they're not in pain, they don't have worries,"" she said.  Don hopes that future studies expand the areas that are investigated. ""It would be useful to examine other physiological states, such as neuroendocrine or sympathetic nervous system responses as outcomes of daily positive and negative relationship experiences, which may reveal different patterns of associations,"" he said.  Making better relationships If hearing the importance of good social relationships makes you lament that you might not have enough, you aren't alone, said Adam Smiley Poswolsky, workplace belonging expert and author of ""Friendship in the Age of Loneliness.""  Many people may feel lonely and want closer connections, but the prospect of making new friendships — or strengthening existing ones — can be daunting, Poswolsky said.  ""It's intimidating to think about friendship in adulthood, and often overwhelm keeps us from even trying,"" he said. His suggestion? Start small. Text a friend that you haven't talked to in a long time, commit to meeting one new person a month, host a dinner party, or join a class. ""If you do just one thing, make a list of five people in your life that you care about, and give one of them a phone call,"" Poswolsky added. ""The most remarkable friendships often begin with tiniest moments of connection."" Remember that you likely won't form a strong connection overnight, he added.  Research shows that it takes 90 hours of time together to consider someone a friend and more than 200 hours to consider them a close friend that you have an emotional connection with, he said.  ""In our busy world, we need to put our friendship on the calendar, and commit to recurring activities,"" Poswolsky said.  But studies also reveal that it isn't just about having relationships — the quality matters. There might not be just one definition of a good friendship, but most strong relationships share some similar qualities, he said.  They tend to prioritize laughter, joy, excitement, courage, vulnerability, affirmation and a lack of judgment, Poswolsky said. And good friendships are often two people helping each other become better versions of themselves, he added. ""Even when — especially when — their friend is struggling or going through something hard,"" Poswolsky said. ""You know someone is a true friend when they have your back when you're sick, when you lose your job, when you make a mistake, when you're going through a break-up, when you're stressed, when you're sad.""

                      Coffee drinkers get more steps but also less sleep, study finds

                      Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide, but the pendulum has swung back and forth about its benefits and drawbacks.  New findings from a small study published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, suggest both upsides and downsides: Drinking at least a cup of coffee per day might make you move more but sleep less — and it might put you at higher risk for one type of heart palpitation.  ""The big picture finding is that there isn't just one single health-related consequence of consuming coffee, but that the reality is more complicated than that,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.  ""The great majority of research on the topic has been observational, meaning we just look and see at what happens to people who do and don't drink coffee, which is profoundly limited by the possibility that ... there may be some other characteristic that is driving whether someone happens to drink coffee,"" Marcus said. ""The only way to mitigate those potential effects was to conduct a randomized interventional trial.""  To get a better idea of coffee's immediate health effects, the authors recruited 100 healthy adults who were age 39 on average and from the San Francisco area. They equipped the participants with Fitbits to track their steps and sleep, continuous blood glucose monitors and electrocardiogram devices that tracked their heart rhythms. Each participant was randomly assigned to drink as much coffee as they wanted for two days, then abstain for two days, repeating that cycle over a two-week period.  On coffee-drinking days, participants got an average of 1,058 more steps than they did on abstention days, the authors found. But on those days, sleep took a hit, with participants getting 36 fewer minutes of shut-eye. The more coffee they drank, the more physical activity and the less sleep they got.  Coffee seemed to affect the heart, too. Researchers found no evidence of a significant relationship between coffee consumption and premature atrial contractions, which are ""very common, early heartbeats that we all experience arising from the top chambers of the heart,"" Marcus said. They can feel like a flutter or skipped beat in your chest.  ""People with more premature atrial contractions are at higher risk of developing a very clinically significant heart rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation,"" he added.   But drinking more than one cup per day resulted in about a 50% higher incidence of premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs, compared with days of no coffee intake.  These heartbeats arise from the lower chambers of the heart, and they can also feel like a skipped beat or heart palpitations.  ""So this provides some compelling evidence that experimenting with (going) off coffee might be worthwhile in those individuals who experience bothersome palpitations related to PVCs,"" Marcus said.  ""There's also evidence that in some people, more PVCs can lead to a weakening of the heart or heart failure,"" Marcus added. ""So it may be that if someone is especially concerned about risks of heart failure — such as they have a family history of it or there's some other indication that their physician tells them (makes) them at risk — they may want to steer clear of coffee.""  Peter Kistler, who is head of electrophysiology at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, described the study as strong but cautioned that ""this is a short-term study in healthy volunteers.""  ""This provides no information on the long-term benefits or adverse effects of long-term coffee drinking,"" said Kistler, who was not involved in the study. ""This does not provide information on the impact of coffee in people with other health conditions, and generally (the study participants) consumed modest amounts of coffee.""  Health effects of coffee When people drink coffee, they might have more motivation to exercise or have enhanced performance once they start moving, Marcus said.  But people ""shouldn't extrapolate that to taking energy drinks or high-dose caffeine as a way to enhance workouts,"" since high doses can lead to disturbances, he said.  That coffee drinking led to less sleep perhaps isn't surprising, but a potential genetic aspect to that finding might be. Researchers collected DNA samples from participants, and those who had greater reductions in sleep when they consumed coffee had genetic variants associated with slower caffeine metabolism. People with genetic variants associated with faster caffeine metabolism, on the other hand, had more premature ventricular contractions.  These findings suggest that an individualized approach to coffee consumption might be the most appropriate method for determining effects on health, according to the study.  Kistler had another view on the finding of diminished sleep.  ""Coffee is the most common 'drug' for cognitive enhancement,"" he said. ""People who drink coffee are less tired. This is not necessarily a negative.""  Regarding the links between coffee intake and premature ventricular contractions, caffeine can contain active metabolites such as aminophylline, which is used in asthma medications and, in high doses, is known to induce arrhythmias, Marcus said.  Additionally, ""coffee tends to increase activity in the sympathetic nervous system, or the adrenaline side of the nervous system, that can promote PVCs,"" he added.  What this means for you  The effects the study found are worth considering based on your personal health goals, Marcus said.  ""Individuals can be reassured that there's certainly no imminently dangerous effects of drinking coffee,"" Marcus said.  Wondering whether you're a fast or slow metabolizer of caffeine? There aren't really any clinical tests in the consumer market, Marcus said, but you might be able to find out by using a DNA test that measures this.   You can also pay close attention to what your experiences might be telling you about your tolerance.  ""If they begin to feel anxious (and) tremulous on one cup of coffee, then they are a slow metabolizer,"" Kistler said via email. ""But if they have a higher tolerance then they are metabolizing coffee more rapidly.""

                      Meat, eggs and dairy account for 75% of our food's carbon footprint in the US. So, vegan milks can be a sustainable substitute. Leaders of one major coffee chain believe in the taste, foam-i-ness and earth-saving benefits of oat milk so much, they've made it the default milk in their coffee drinks. But how does oat milk's sustainability and nutritive value stack up?

                      Home organization shows can be simultaneously uplifting and deflating with rows of matching containers on every shelf of the pantry and cabinets. Typically they're in a gleaming white kitchen, no less. Let's leave the aesthetics aside for a moment, because I will be honest and tell you that I do not own a gorgeous kitchen. It is downright ugly in many respects, but it is functional. And function is the reason I'm making the argument that you should store your pantry ingredients in containers. Even if you're not using matched sets of brand-new modular storage or bins (and I'm not suggesting that you do), decanting ingredients from their bags and other packaging into containers is a smart move. Here's why I do it and why I believe everyone should start containing their ingredients. You'll save space and fit more in the pantry There's no one-size-fits-all solution for pantry storage because every kitchen layout has its own specific challenges. However, a general rule of thumb is that containers are simpler to store in cupboards and on shelves than bags.  Instead of piling bags and digging through the stack to find what you're looking for, containers are stackable and easily movable. One wrong grab can send a cascade of snack bags or granola bars crashing to the floor, but containers keep food in check. Both glass and plastic are durable, though families with kids frequently prefer plastic containers because of the weight and breakability factor. As for round versus square containers, ""round ones don't maximize the space in between"" as effectively as square or rectangular containers do, said Shara Kay, a Los Angeles-based certified professional organizer and owner of SK Organizing. My pantry storage situation includes a mix of airtight plastic rectangular containers, glass mason jars, larger restaurant-style food storage bins and repurposed containers — all from various brands in various sizes. Some are ingredient-specific, such as those for my brown sugar and granulated sugar, and others are generic containers.  For those with deep pantry shelves, a hybrid solution — aka ""containers for your containers"" — might be necessary. Open-top or open-front pantry storage bins can help group similar items together and allow you to pull out one large container rather than a lot of small jars or canisters. This works well for keeping ingredients such as baking soda, baking powder, vanilla extract and other baking-related items together.  If your shelves are less than 12 inches deep, according to Kay, you may not want to double up on bins. But if you have a deeper reach-in pantry, ""you probably do, because things will get lost in the back."" In my pantry, I have a mix of purchased bins and repurposed open box-style containers, including a few old letter trays from my office that hold small mason jars of my granola, dried fruit and other breakfast snacks. You'll waste less food Clear containers can help people visualize what they have immediately, Kay said, making it easy to see if there's enough penne in the pantry for tonight's dinner or if it's time to restock the black bean stash. If you always end up buying an extra box of pasta because you can't remember what you have on hand, containers may help with overbuying. Airtight containers also keep snacks and other loose items from losing their crunch too quickly. ""If you're taking a long time to consume things and they're going stale,"" Kay said, ""that's a good instance to decant."" Bag clips can't maintain an airtight seal, but if you store your half-open bags of Cheez-Its in a sealable container, you're winning the war. However, you'll still need to do routine pantry maintenance to make sure you're not leaving foods in bins for too long. It's smart to use the first-in, first-out rule with your ingredients, whether they're in the pantry, fridge or freezer. I personally don't buy so much food that I won't use it before it goes stale or past its expiration date, but if that's an issue in your house, keep track with writable stickers on your containers and bins. And if you have a few handfuls of ingredients left, Kay said, ""when you're decanting, use up the stuff at the bottom before adding to the top.""  Your food will be pest-proof No one wants to believe they could get pests in their pantry, but it's better to think about this situation before it happens. And as someone who lives in a century-old home, I'm here to give you the news firsthand: The pests will take the smallest opportunity to invade every single time. Whether plastic or glass, sealed containers are the best line of defense against rodents and insects. Kay's rule is ""the more airtight, the better,"" but I'll go one further. Containers beat bags every time because I have yet to meet a mouse, ant or moth that can penetrate a rigid container. And I unfortunately can't say the same for store packaging — even sealed cardboard boxes.  You don't need to go out and buy all new containers As convincing as my argument for containers may be, it doesn't mean you have to buy out your local home goods store immediately. Start with the containers you have on hand, such as mason jars or plastic bins. Or if you need to buy a set of containers, ""start with five and see how it goes,"" Kay said. ""If it's working for you, then acquire more."" Similarly, ""don't go decanting every single snack in your pantry on the first go-round,"" Kay added. She recommends starting with baking staples such as flour and sugar as well as other items that are usually scooped and measured incrementally rather than all at once. Rice or grains and dried beans are ideal candidates, as are nuts and dried fruit. For those who still want to keep ingredients in their bagged packaging, you have two options. One is to store your open bags of snacks in larger sealable containers, as mentioned earlier, and the second is to stack your bags in open-top bins.  ""My family won't eat some food if it's not in the original packaging because they're drawn to the original packaging,"" Kay admitted. As you start transitioning to the container method of pantry storage, you'll find the right balance for your family as well.

                      Four California sea otters died from an unusual strain of a parasite that could pose a risk to humans

                      Four sea otters in California have died from a rare strain of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite that scientists said could pose a risk to human health. Researchers called the finding a ""complete surprise"" because this strain of T. gondii had never been reported in any aquatic animal or in coastal California. Their study, led by researchers from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and University of California, Davis, was published this week in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. ""Since Toxoplasma can infect any warm-blooded animal, it could also potentially cause disease in animals and humans that share the same environment or food resources, including mussels, clams, oysters, and crabs that are consumed raw or undercooked,"" Melissa Miller, a California Department of Fish and Wildlife researcher and author of the paper, said in news release. The four sea otters stranded from 2020 to 2022, and each had an ""unusual and severe"" condition called steatitis, or inflammation of body fat. Toxoplasmosis is common in sea otters, and it's known that it can be deadly, the researchers wrote, but this strain of T. gondii was able to rapidly kill apparently healthy adult otters. No cases have been reported in humans, but researchers called the otters ""important sentinels"" of the circulating strain, which could be a risk to people eating seafood or ingesting contaminated water. ""Because this parasite can infect humans and other animals, we want others to be aware of our findings, quickly recognize cases if they encounter them and take precautions to prevent infection,"" Miller said. ""We encourage others to take extra precautions if they observe inflamed systemic fat deposits in sea otters or other marine wildlife."" Most people infected with T. gondii have no symptoms and aren't aware of their infection, but severe toxoplasmosis can cause damage to the brain, eyes and other organs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy and can lead to significant health problems after birth. People at higher risk for severe infection are infants born to mothers who were infected during or shortly before pregnancy and people with weakened immune systems. To prevent any toxoplasmosis infection, the CDC recommends typical food safety practices such as cooking foods to a high internal temperature, rinsing fruits and vegetables and washing utensils.  Cat feces is known to contain high levels of the parasite, so the CDC urges people to keep pet cats inside, change the litter box every day -- before the parasite becomes infectious -- and wash hands well. In the study, the researchers said more work is needed to investigate habitat or climate change factors that may have led to the spread of the rare strain in otters, and to examine whether other aquatic wildlife are infected.

                      California bill aims to ban sale of popular candies containing ingredients that may cause health issues
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/health/red-dye-no-3-bill-cancer-risk-wellness/index.html,"

                      Some chemicals linked to health issues have been banned in food products in the European Union, while the United States has allowed use at levels determined safe. A bill recently introduced in the California State Assembly could start to change that.  Assembly Bill 418, or AB 418, seeks to prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of food products in California containing red dye No. 3, titanium dioxide, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil or propylparaben, according to a news release from the Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel's office, who introduced the bill with fellow Democratic lawmaker Buffy Wicks. If passed, the bill would go into effect January 1, 2025.  Titanium dioxide is a powder used as a white colorant or to give a smooth texture in candies and other processed foods. Potassium bromate is added to baked goods to help dough strengthen and rise higher. In some beverages, brominated vegetable oil keeps citrus flavoring from floating to the top. Propylparabens are used for antimicrobial food preservation.  In the EU, these chemicals are banned ""due to scientific studies that have demonstrated significant public health harms, including increased risk of cancer, behavioral issues in children, harm to the reproductive system, and damage to the immune system,"" Gabriel's news release says.  A search of the Environmental Working Group's Eat Well Guide returns nearly 3,000 products that use red dye No. 3 as an ingredient, including popular candies such as Skittles, Nerds candies and Trolli gummies; protein shakes; instant rice and potato products; and boxed cake mixes.  The National Confectioners Association, a trade organization based in Washington, DC, released a statement on March 23 in response to the bill's introduction: ""Chocolate and candy are safe to enjoy, as they have been for centuries. We strongly oppose AB 418 because there is no evidence to support banning the ingredients listed in the bill. The ingredients that would be banned under this proposal have all been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Food safety is the number one priority for U.S. confectionery companies, and we do not use any ingredients in our products that do not comply with the FDA's strictest safety standards."" ""We know that they are harmful and that children are likely eating more of these chemicals than adults,"" Susan Little, senior advocate of California government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, said in Gabriel's release. ""It makes no sense that the same products food manufacturers sell in California are sold in the EU but without these toxic chemicals."" FDA loophole The chemicals can be used in foods because of a loophole in the US Food and Drug Administration's Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that's known as the Generally Recognized as Safe rule. In the context of food, the guidance states the use of certain additives is not subject to premarket approval requirements if the additives meet specific criteria that experts have deemed to be safe for consumption.  A California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment study that found red dye No. 3 can make children vulnerable to behavioral difficulties — such as decreased attention — also concluded that current federal levels for safe intake of food dyes might not protect children's brain health. The analysis noted that the current legal levels, set decades ago by the FDA, don't consider newer research, according to the Environmental Working Group.  An FDA spokesperson declined to comment to CNN due to the pending legislation.  Linda Birnbaum, former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, expressed support for the bill during a Thursday news conference advocating for the removal of red dye No. 3 from food products. ""As California goes, eventually so goes the nation because manufacturers don't want to make things that they can't sell to the fifth-largest economy in the world,"" Birnbaum said. ""So California's actions have major impact not only in the US but worldwide.""  How to avoid some of these ingredients  The FDA requires manufacturers to list red dye No. 3 as an ingredient on food labels. Those who are concerned should check ingredient lists as a first step. Red dye No. 3 is listed as ""FD&C Red #3.""  In medications, you can look for dyes in the ""inactive ingredients"" section or look for dye-free versions of some drugs, Consumer Reports suggests.

                      'Everything has changed': Users of recalled eye drops describe permanent vision problems after infections
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/health/eye-infection-patients/index.html,"

                      Renee Martray of South Carolina has severe and permanent corneal scarring resulting in vision loss. She says it's like trying to peer through eyeglasses that have been dipped in oil. Nancy Montz of Ohio developed a corneal ulcer, spent three weeks in the hospital and lost vision in her left eye.  Carla Oliva of Florida developed a severe eye infection and, when treatment failed, had to have her right eye removed. She's now legally blind. The women said their problems began after they used EzriCare Artificial Tears, which is part of a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Food and Drug Administration investigation into a multistate outbreak of a rare strain of bacteria. EzriCare said in a statement last month that when it learned of the investigation January 20, it was not aware of any testing that definitively linked the outbreak to its product.  ""Nonetheless, we immediately took action to stop any further distribution or sale of EzriCare Artificial Tears. To the greatest extent possible, we have been contacting customers to advise them against continued use of the product."" EzriCare did not respond to CNN's request for comment this week. The artificial tears are made by India-based Global Pharma Healthcare, which issued a recall of both EzriCare and Delsam Pharma artificial tears.  Delsam Pharma's product has not been linked to infections, but the CDC and US Food and Drug Administration have advised patients to stop using eye drops from either company pending additional guidance.  Since the start of its investigation, the CDC has identified 68 people in 16 states with infections of a rare strain of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never before been reported in the United States.  There have been three deaths, eight cases of vision loss and four surgical eye removals reported, according to the CDC.  The investigation started with three distinct outbreaks and no apparent connection, said Dr. Maroya Walters, public health service officer and the CDC's lead investigator on the outbreak. The agency was initially notified in late June 2022 about eye infections among four people at an ophthalmology clinic in California, and tests revealed the unexpected bacteria behind them, Walters said. The bacteria had a mutation that makes it highly resistant to drugs designed to treat it. This type of drug-resistant Pseudomonas had never been associated with an eye infection, Walters said.  Walters told CNN two other infection outbreaks were reported at long-term care facilities. One involved 21 people in Connecticut in late July and another included three people in Utah in August. Genetic sequencing in September revealed that the three bacterial strains were nearly identical, Walters said.  ""The patients had very, very few overarching commonalities. They were from different kinds of facilities that had different kinds of infections,"" Walters said. ""We were really looking comprehensively at products that patients received but not finding a lot of commonalities."" 'What did I do?' As the investigators were searching for a common source, eye drop users searched for answers. Oliva, 68, says she was given EzriCare artificial tears for dry eyes from a medical center in Hialeah, Florida, in May. After using the drops for two months, she woke up August 1 with burning, itchiness, redness and tearing in her right eye. She went to an ophthalmologist, who said she had a corneal scratch and prescribed antibiotics, but her symptoms just got worse. She then went to Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, where physicians discovered a large ulcer associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Oliva says she went to Bascom Palmer every day from August 4 to September 1 to receive topical antibiotics. They also tried stronger and stronger medications, but the infection persisted. Doctors attempted to do a cornea transplant August 29, but the infection was too severe to save the eye. It was surgically removed September 1 and replaced with a plastic implant at the end of December.  She spent months wondering what happened.  ""I cried constantly, asking why this happened to me. How could this have happened to me? I was searching for an answer: What happened to me? At what moment? How? When? What did I do?"" she told CNN in Spanish. ""And to not have an answer, that is the most terrible thing.""  But because she didn't know about the investigation until after she lost her eye, she continued to use the drops. Martray, 48, also had dry eyes and bought the artificial tears at a store in South Carolina last summer. After using them for about a month, she began having pain, swelling, burning, blurry vision, watering and redness.  She went to an eye doctor and got antibiotics to try to treat the infection. But she continued to use the drops until October.  In December, the infection returned. She says she went to the clinic every day, including Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. She was eventually diagnosed with severe, permanent corneal scarring.  She says her condition left her ""very depressed.""  ""When it first came about, I just didn't even want to leave the house. I just laid around and cried. I just wanted to get better,"" she said. Detecting future outbreaks Similar cases were being reported across the country. According to a statement released January 20 from the CDC, from May 17 to January 19, the agency, in partnership with state and local health departments, identified the bacteria in 50 people across 11 states, with 38 cases linked to four health care facility outbreaks. Most of the people reported using artificial tears, the CDC said, and EzriCare Artificial Tears was the brand most commonly reported. The agency's lab testing confirmed the presence of the outbreak strain in opened eye drop bottles. Researchers are now testing unopened bottles for the same bacteria. Walters attributes the discovery in large part to sequencing and reporting done at state and local health departments. ""I think without that, we never would have found this outbreak, and we need to really keep those programs strong, because I'm sure this is not the last time,"" she said. ""We need to maintain these activities to be able to detect future outbreaks and to be even faster at detecting them and finding the source."" Walters says the CDC continues to receive reports of ""catastrophic and life-altering infections,"" many of them months old. 'I feel useless' Oliva said she learned about the eye drop recall on the news early this year. At first, she felt relieved.  ""On the other hand, I felt anger and indignation, because how could they be so negligent, so careless to make a product that could cost someone's life?"" said Oliva, who has filed a lawsuit against several companies including EzriCare and Global Pharma.  She says she's had to learn how to walk again due to new issues with stability. She has trouble driving, working or doing everyday tasks like going to the grocery store. ""Everything has changed. I feel useless."" Martray, who has also filed a lawsuit against several companies including EzriCare and Global Pharma, said she learned about the bacteria from news articles her daughter sent her. ""I'm really shocked, because I've always just -- I just trusted,"" she said. ""I feel that if they're made for the eyes and the box is sealed and everything, it's good.  I never thought that something like that could happen. They were sealed bottle drops. You just grab them, you put them in your eyes, you don't even think twice about it. Especially when you've been wearing contacts since sixth grade."" EzriCare and Global Pharma did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuits or the ongoing investigation. CNN initially reached out to EzriCare on March 17. Learning to adjust Montz, 72, had used EzriCare tears for about a week in November when she started noticing blurry vision. One morning, she woke to find yellow discharge on her pillow. She went to the emergency room, where doctors discovered a large ulcer on her left cornea, involving nearly the entire eye. She spent three weeks in the hospital, where she got antibiotics and multiple surgeries. Her case was complicated by a serous choroidal detachment, an abnormal accumulation of fluid, which ultimately led to vision loss in the left eye. She said she's learning to accept her situation and feels ""pretty good"" despite weeks of treatment. ""It is what it is. Me being crabby is not going to change anything, I have to make the best of it, accept it and go on,"" she said. Martray says she's been having frequent migraines from straining her eyes and can no longer do many things she previously enjoyed, like baking or crafts. ""You don't realize how much you rely on your vision for, I mean, just everything. Your vision is everything,"" she said.  Oliva wants accountability for what happened to her and others.  ""I want those responsible for doing this to me and other people to pay for their negligence, because they were negligent. They marketed something that was contaminated,"" she said. ""They played with my life and my family's life.""

                      Everyone benefits when there is less air pollution, but it pays off more for older communities with high poverty rates and those where larger populations of Black people live, regardless of income, a new study finds. The study, published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at the connection between deaths and a type of air pollution called PM2.5. The US Environmental Protection Agency said in January that it is trying to determine how it can best create regulations to strengthen the standards for PM2.5 pollution. The researchers on the new study said that with that in mind, they wanted to provide policy-makers with additional evidence on how marginalized communities, which already tend to have poorer health outcomes, are disproportionately affected by air pollution.  Other studies have shown this connection for individual groups such as people of color or those with low income, but these researchers wanted to look at the effects on communities based simultaneously on socioeconomic status and race.  Fine particulate matter, or particle pollution, is the mix of solid and liquid droplets floating in the air. It can come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants create it, as do cars, agriculture, unpaved roads, construction sites and wildfires. PM2.5 has particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. It's so tiny -- 1/20th the width of a human hair -- that it can travel past your body's usual defenses when you breathe it in. Instead of being carried out of your body when you exhale, it can get stuck in your lungs or go into your bloodstream. In the short term, the pollution can irritate the eyes, nose, throat and lungs and cause coughing, sneezing or shortness of breath. Long-term, this dirty air can also cause lasting damage and lead to health conditions like obesity, cancer, stroke, heart problems, asthma, depression, anxiety and even premature death. In 2019 alone, long-term exposure to particle pollution contributed to 4 million deaths worldwide. For the new study, researchers analyzed Medicare data from 73 million people who were 65 or older from 2000 through 2016. They estimated the associations between annual PM2.5 exposure and mortality in communities defined by racial identity (Black vs. White) and income level (Medicaid-eligible vs. ineligible).  Everyone would benefit from cleaner air, they found, but higher- and lower-income Black people and low-income White people may benefit more from lower PM2.5 levels than higher-income White people. The EPA is trying to determine how much stricter US air pollution safety standards should be. It's considering lowering the standards from 12 micrograms per cubic meter to between 9 and 10 micrograms per cubic meter.  This study suggests that if the EPA were to go even further and lower the standard to 8 micrograms, the US would have a 4% reduction in overall mortality rate, study co-author Dr. Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics, population and data science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said.  These stricter standards would have even more advantage for Black people. The mortality rate would be 7% lower among Black people who have what the researchers defined as a ""higher"" income, meaning anyone who was not eligible for Medicaid, and a 6% rate reduction among Black people with a lower income. Medicaid eligibility requires earnings below the federal poverty level, which was $13,590 for a single adult and $27,750 for a family of four in 2022.  ""So you've doubled the mortality rate rate reduction by putting more stringent standards for marginalized communities,"" Dominici said. ""To me, that was surprising, how much more benefit you're going to get.""  The study can't specifically get at the reasons for this difference, but Dominici has a few ideas. ""It's potentially due to the social structure forces that lead to discrimination and social exclusion,"" she said, rather than to biological differences. Other studies have shown that, regardless of income or region, decades of segregation mean Black people tend to live in areas where there is greater exposure to air pollution.  This study is looking at an older population, Dominici said, meaning its participants were born when segregated neighborhoods were common.  ""I think that it could be the combined effect of living through these times of being denied an equal opportunity to be healthy,"" she said. In general, Black Americans have less access to health care and higher rates of health problems, and they breathe a higher level of pollution. ""There is enormous evidence of environmental inequities in the United States, and so with more stringent pollution standards, there will be more equity,"" Dominici said. ""We are at a crucial time when the EPA is thinking about more stringent standards, so it will be important to think about the context involved and to really think through these decisions with regard to environmental justice, race and social class.""

                      The eyes are more than a window to the soul — they're also a reflection of a person's cognitive health.  ""The eye is the window into the brain,"" said ophthalmologist Dr. Christine Greer, director of medical education at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. ""You can see directly into the nervous system by looking into the back of the eye, toward the optic nerve and retina."" Research has been exploring how the eye may help in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease before symptoms begin. The disease is well advanced by the time memory and behavior are affected.  ""Alzheimer's disease begins in the brain decades before the first symptoms of memory loss,"" said Dr. Richard Isaacson, an Alzheimer's preventive neurologist who is also at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases.  If doctors are able to identify the disease in its earliest stages, people could then make healthy lifestyle choices and control their ""modifiable risk factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes,"" Isaacson said, The eye knows Just how early can we see signs of cognitive decline? To find out, a recent study examined donated tissue from the retina and brains of 86 people with different degrees of mental decline.  ""Our study is the first to provide in-depth analyses of the protein profiles and the molecular, cellular, and structural effects of Alzheimer's disease in the human retina and how they correspond with changes in the brain and cognitive function,"" said senior author Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, a professor of neurosurgery and biomedical sciences at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, in a statement.  ""These changes in the retina correlated with changes in parts of the brain called the entorhinal and temporal cortices, a hub for memory, navigation and the perception of time,"" Koronyo-Hamaoui said.  Investigators in the study collected retinal and brain tissue samples over 14 years from 86 human donors with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment —  the largest group of retinal samples ever studied, according to the authors.  Researchers then compared samples from donors with normal cognitive function to those with mild cognitive impairment and those with later-stage Alzheimer's disease.   The study, published in February in the journal Acta Neuropathologica, found significant increases in beta-amyloid, a key marker of Alzheimer's disease, in people with both Alzheimer's and early cognitive decline. Microglial cells declined by 80% in those with cognitive issues, the study found. These cells are responsible for repairing and maintaining other cells, including clearing beta-amyloid from the brain and retina. ""Markers of inflammation were (also) found, which may be an equally important marker for disease progression,"" said Isaacson, who was not involved in the study. ""The findings were also apparent in people with no or minimal cognitive symptoms, which suggests these new eye tests may be well-positioned to aid in early diagnosis."" The study researchers found higher numbers of immune cells tightly surrounding amyloid beta plaques as well as other cells responsible for inflammation and cell and tissue death. Tissue atrophy and inflammation in cells in the far periphery of the retina were most predictive of cognitive status, the study found.   ""These findings may eventually lead to the development of imaging techniques that allow us to diagnose Alzheimer's disease earlier and more accurately,"" Isaacson said, ""and monitor its progression noninvasively by looking through the eye.""

                      Colorectal cancer is rising among younger adults and scientists are racing to uncover why

                      Nikki Lawson received the shock of her life at age 35. A couple of years ago, she noticed that her stomach often felt irritable, and she would get sudden urges to use the restroom, sometimes with blood in her stool. She even went to the hospital one day when her symptoms were severe, she said, and she was told it might be a stomach ulcer before being sent home. ""That was around the time when Chadwick Boseman, the actor, passed away. I remember watching him on the news and having the same symptoms,"" Lawson said of the ""Black Panther"" star who died of colon cancer at age 43 in August 2020.  ""But at that time, I was not thinking 'this is something that I'm going through,' "" she said. Instead, Lawson thought changing her diet would help. She stopped eating certain red meats and ate more fruits and vegetables. She began losing a lot of weight, which she thought was the result of her new diet. ""But then I went for a physical,"" Lawson said.  Her primary care physician recommended that she see a gastroenterologist immediately because she had low iron levels. ""When I went and I saw my gastro, she said, 'I'm sorry, I have bad news. We see something. We sent it off to get testing. It looks like it is cancer.' My whole world just kind of blanked out,"" Lawson said. ""I was 35, healthy, going about my day, raising my daughter, and to get a diagnosis like this, I was just so shocked.""  Lawson, who was diagnosed with stage III rectal cancer, is among a growing group of colon and rectal cancer patients in the United States who are diagnosed at a young age.  The share of colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults younger than 55 in the US has been rising since the 1990s, and no one knows why. 'Crying through chemotherapy' Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are calling for more work to be done to understand, prevent and treat colorectal cancer at younger ages. In a paper published last week in the journal Science, the researchers, Dr. Marios Giannakis and Dr. Kimmie Ng, outlined a way for scientists to accelerate their investigations into the puzzling rise of colorectal cancer among younger ages, calling for more specialized research centers to focus on younger patients with the disease and for diverse populations to be included in studies on early-onset colorectal cancer.  Their hope is that this work will help improve outcomes for young colorectal cancer patients like Lawson.  Among younger adults, ages 20 to 49, colorectal cancer is estimated to become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2030. Lawson, now 36 and living in Palm Bay, Florida, with her 5-year-old daughter, is in remission and cancer-free.  The former middle school teacher had several surgeries and received radiation therapy and chemotherapy to treat her cancer. She is now being monitored closely by her doctors. For other young people with colorectal cancer, ""my words of hope would be to just stay strong. Just find that courage within yourself to say, 'You know what, I'm going to fight this.' And I just looked within myself,"" Lawson said.  ""I also have a very supportive family system, so they were definitely there for me. But it was very emotional,"" she said of her cancer treatments.  ""I remember crying through chemotherapy sessions and the medicine making you so weak, and my daughter was 4, and having to be strong for her,"" she said. ""My advice to any young person: If you see symptoms or you see something's not right and you're losing a lot of weight and not really trying to, go to see a doctor."" Signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer include changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, cramping or abdominal pain, weakness and fatigue, and weight loss. A report released this month by the American Cancer Society shows that the proportion of colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019. Yet the factors driving that rise remain a mystery. There's probably more than just one cause, said Lawson's surgeon, Dr. Steven Lee-Kong, chief of colorectal surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey.  He has noticed an increase in colorectal cancer patients in their 40s and 30s within his own practice. His youngest patient was 21 when she was diagnosed with rectal cancer. ""There is a phenomenon of decreasing overall colorectal cancer rates in the population in general, we think because of the increase in screening for particularly for older adults,"" Lee-Kong said. ""But that doesn't really account for the overall increase in the number of patients younger than, say, 50 and 45 that are developing cancer."" 'There's something else going on' Some of the factors known to raise anyone's risk of colorectal cancer are having a family history of the disease, having a certain genetic mutation, drinking too much alcohol, smoking cigarettes or being obese. ""They were established as risk factors in older cohorts of patients, but they do seem to be also associated with early-onset disease, and those are things like excess body weight, lack of physical activity, high consumption of processed meat and red meat, very high alcohol consumption,"" said Rebecca Siegel, a cancer epidemiologist and senior scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society, who was lead author of this month's report. ""But the data don't support these specific factors as solely driving the trend,"" she said. ""So if you have excess body weight, you are at a higher risk of colorectal cancer in your 40s than someone who is average weight. That is true. But the excess risk is pretty small. So again, that is probably not what's driving this increase, and it's another reason to think that there's something else going on."" Many people who are being diagnosed at a younger age were not obese, including some high-profile cases, such as Broadway actor Quentin Oliver Lee, who died last year at 34 after being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. ""Anecdotally, in conferences that I've attended, that is the word on the street: that most of these patients are very healthy. They're not obese; they're very active,"" Siegel said, which adds to the mystery. ""We know that excess weight increases your risk, and we know that we've had a big increase in body weight in this country,"" she said. ""And that is contributing to more cancer for a lot of cancers and also for colorectal cancer. But does it explain this trend that we're seeing, this steep increase? No, it doesn't."" Yet scientists remain divided when it comes to just how much of a role those known risk factors -- especially obesity -- play in the rise of colorectal cancer among adults younger than 55. Scientists debate the role of obesity Even though the cause of the rise of colorectal cancer in younger adults is ""still not very well understood,"" Dr. Subhankar Chakraborty argues that dietary and lifestyle factors could be playing larger roles than some would think. ""We know that smoking, alcohol, lack of physical activity, being overweight or obese, increased consumption of red meat -- so basically, dietary factors and environmental and lifestyle factors -- are likely playing a big role,"" said Chakraborty, a gastroenterologist with The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""There are also some other factors, such as the growing incidence of inflammatory bowel disease, that may also be playing a role, and I think the biggest factors is most likely the diet, the lifestyle and the environmental factors,"" he said. It has been difficult to pinpoint causes of the rise of cases in younger ages because, if someone has a polyp in their colon for example, it can take 10 to 15 years to develop into cancer, he says. ""During that, all the way from a polyp to the cancer stage, the person is exposed to a variety of things in their life. And to really pinpoint what is going on, we would need to follow specific individuals over time to really understand their dietary patterns, medications and weight changes,"" Chakraborty said. ""So that makes it really hard, because of the time that cancer actually takes to develop."" Some researchers have been investigating ways in which the rise in colorectal cancer among younger adults may be connected to increases in childhood obesity in the US. ""The rise in young-onset colorectal cancer correlates with a doubling of the prevalence of childhood obesity over the last 30 years, now affecting 20% of those under age 20,"" Dr. William Karnes, a gastroenterologist and director of high-risk colorectal cancer services at the UCI Health Digestive Health Institute in California, said in an email.  ""However, other factors may exist,"" he said, adding that he has noticed ""an increasing frequency of being shocked"" by discoveries of colorectal cancer in his younger patients. There could be correlations between obesity in younger adults, the foods they eat and the increase in colorectal cancers for the young adult population, said Dr. Shane Dormady, a medical oncologist from El Camino Health in California who treats colorectal cancer patients. ""I think younger people are on average consuming less healthy food -- fast food, processed snacks, processed sugars -- and I think that those foods also contain higher concentrations of carcinogens and mutagens, in addition to the fact that they are very fattening,"" Dormady said.  ""It's well-publicized that child, adolescent, young adult obesity is rampant, if not epidemic, in our country,"" he said. ""And whenever a person is at an unhealthy weight, especially at a young age, which is when the cells are most susceptible to DNA damage, it really starts the ball rolling in the wrong direction."" Yet at the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, researchers and physicians are not seeing a definite correlation between the rise in colorectal cancer among their younger adult patients and a rise in obesity, according to Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, gastroenterologist and co-director of the center, where scientists and doctors continue to work around the clock to solve this mystery.  ""When we looked at our patients, the majority were more likely to be overweight and obese, but when we compare them to a national cohort without cancer, they're actually less likely to be overweight and obese,"" she said. ""And anecdotally, a lot of the patients that we see are young and fit and don't really fit the obesity profile.""  That leaves many oncologists scratching their heads. Growing doubt that genetics is involved Some scientists are also exploring whether genetic mutations that can raise someone's risk for colorectal cancer have played a role in the rise of cases among younger adults -- but the majority of these patients do not have them. Karnes, of UCI Health, said ""it is unlikely"" that there has been an increase in the genetic mutations that raise the

                      Autism diagnosis has become more common, but pandemic disrupted early detection, CDC says
                  ",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/23/health/autism-diagnosis-cdc-report/index.html,"

                      The rate of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has been growing steadily since 2000, but two new reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlight disparities in the types of children identified to have autism spectrum disorder and setbacks in early detection.   In 2020, about 1 in 36 children had been diagnosed with autism by age 8, according to the CDC -- about 2.8%. That's up from a prevalence of 1 in 44 children in 2018 and 1 in 150 children in 2000. But according to the CDC, this long-term trend has ""largely been interpreted as improvements in more equitable identification of (autism spectrum disorder), particularly for children in groups that have less access or face greater barriers in obtaining services."" For the first time, diagnosis was more common among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it was among White children. The CDC researchers note that this shift ""may reflect improved screening, awareness, and access to services among historically underserved groups."" In fact, between 2018 and 2020, autism prevalence rose more than twice as fast among Asian, Black and Hispanic children than it did among White children.  These findings are based on surveillance data from 11 communities that participate in the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. The data are not nationally representative and vary widely by location -- from a prevalence of 1 in 22 children in California to about half as many in Maryland. The CDC says more research is needed to understand this variation, which could be related to differences in the strategies used to identify and diagnose the condition. Still, some trends have stayed consistent.  Autism prevalence is significantly higher among boys than girls -- in 2020, there was about a four-fold difference. But it was the first year that more than 1% of 8-year-old girls had been diagnosed with autism.  Also, disparities persist in identifying autism in children who also have an intellectual disability. In 2020, more than half of Black children diagnosed with autism also had an intellectual disability, compared with less than a third of White children. According to the researchers, this finding suggests a need to better detect and evaluate developmental concerns beyond cognitive ability.  Generally, children who have intellectual disabilities are more likely to be diagnosed with autism earlier. But early detection is important for all children with autism, as it helps connect them with helpful resources and interventions.  In recent years, good progress had been made in early detection of autism -- an earlier CDC report found that children born in 2014 were 50% more likely to receive an autism diagnosis or special education by age 4 than those born in 2010. Another new report published by the CDC on Thursday shows that there was evidence of continued improvement in these trends through February 2020, but the trends reversed as the Covid-19 pandemic hit with ""sustained lower levels"" of evaluations and identification of autism across most of the surveillance network.  In first six months of the pandemic, there were 217 fewer evaluations for every 1,000 children at age 4 than there were four years earlier. There were also nearly three fewer identifications for every 10,000 children, according to the CDC report.  ""Disruptions due to the pandemic in the timely evaluation of children and delays in connecting children to the services and support they need could have long-lasting effects,"" said Dr. Karen Remley, director of CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. ""The data in this report can help communities better understand how the pandemic impacted early identification of autism in young children and anticipate future needs as these children get older.""

                      'I don't trust myself.' For Muslims with eating disorders, fasting in Ramadan brings another set of challenges

                      As the Islamic holy month of Ramadan begins, Habiba says she is ""terrified"" by the thought of fasting this year. After her disordered eating patterns spiraled into bulimia and binge eating disorder during her mid-teens, she says the ritual of abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset can exacerbate the need to restrict her eating further and risk slipping into a toxic cycle.  But making the decision to refrain from the practice feels like she is neglecting a key part of her faith, she says. ""I don't trust myself with keeping a fast because I know ... I'll start to enjoy the feelings of hunger and I'm terrified (of) what that will do to me,"" said the 30-year-old UK-based Muslim editor, who asked CNN to use only her first name for privacy reasons. ""I do feel sad. I feel like I'm missing out on a really spiritual experience."" Habiba was nine years old when she first had the urge to make herself sick, she says. By the age of about 16 she says she was skipping meals, tracking calories, blacking out as a result of hunger, overexercising and vomiting at least 15 times a day.   ""I would never wish something like bulimia, especially, on anyone, because it's like an addiction.""  Habiba is not alone in her experience. A growing number of Muslim doctors and psychologists are trying to bridge the gap between faith leaders and worshippers like Habiba, who say they face marginalization when trying to access support within their own communities, as well as in the public health system. ""Minorities are underrepresented. It's not that they don't have eating disorders or suffer, but there is all this stigma around who comes to get help,"" Dr. Omara Naseem, a UK-based counseling psychologist who specializes in treating eating disorders, said. These are ""invisible and indiscriminate"" illnesses that transcend age, religion, gender and sexuality, she added. ""It's an act of worship to take care of your body and health. Therefore, go and get the right help that you need,"" she said. Creating a 'binge purge cycle' During Ramadan, Muslims are encouraged to hydrate and eat a balanced meal before sunrise and then break their fast with a date and water at sunset, followed by a larger meal. Worshippers also engage in other forms of practice including increased prayer, giving more to charity, volunteering and participating in communal meals.   However, the act of fasting during daylight hours can mask restrictive dieting patterns associated with eating disorders, said Naseem. Exercising control and experiencing hunger while fasting could generate a desire to binge large amounts of food quickly at iftar -- the breaking of the fast after sundown -- which could result in feeling out of control and ""ashamed,"" creating a ""binge purge cycle"" and setting back recovery, she added.  According to the Quran, people who are sick or traveling are not required to fast as long as they make up fasts once they are healthy or feed less fortunate Muslims throughout the month. Therefore, if someone has an illness or condition that is verified by a medical professional, they are not required to fast, said Imam Nadim Ali, a Muslim faith leader and licensed professional counselor based in Atlanta, Georgia.  For example, children and the elderly and people who are pregnant, menstruating, or require daily medication are exempt from fasting. However, community and society-wide taboos mean that mental health illnesses are not given credence in the same way as physical sickness, both Naseem and Ali said. That means those who choose not to fast due to mental health illnesses face ""guilt and shame"" from their communities and wider society, added Naseem. Cultural barriers Habiba said she has childhood memories of having her body constantly audited by members of her extended family, a behavior she says is symptomatic of the cultural pressures some South Asian and Muslim girls face as they enter womanhood. When she was 15, she remembers an uncle telling her she'd ""gotten fat"" after returning from a family trip to Turkey. ""Comments like that stick forever,"" she said. Over the following years, her weight dropped drastically. At the same time, she remembers being told by extended family members that she could no longer play outside and skateboard with her boy cousins. Instead, she was encouraged to hang out with her girl peers and play with makeup. Despite having ""liberal"" parents, she said, she believes her eating disorder was partly a response to the pressure of fitting into strict gender roles assigned by her community and wider society. When she was about 16, Habiba said her eating disorder symptoms worsened until her parents took her to a local doctor. She received outpatient psychiatric care at a children's mental health unit until she was 18, when she was transferred to an adult mental health unit. However, she says the cultural differences between herself and the White therapists she saw meant they could not understand the nuanced pressures she faced as a woman in her community; and how they were intrinsically tied to her eating disorder.  ""I had White therapists who just did not understand and would really just be very condescending about, you know, things that I wanted to talk about or things I was struggling with.""  Farheen Hasan, a 27-year-old research psychologist based in Bristol, southwest England, agrees that there's a need for therapists to understand specific cultural pressures.  At the age of 18, Hasan said she started to exhibit disordered eating patterns in the form of avoiding food, over-exercising and becoming obsessed with healthy eating. Every year, she said she faced an internal struggle over whether or not to fast during Ramadan.  ""I think we need access to therapists who understand our culture, religion and struggle -- and who can provide professional guidance and support,"" she told CNN over email. Getting help Habiba and Hasan's stories reflect the systemic challenges people from underserved communities widely face when accessing mental health support.  Even though people of color have higher rates of some mental health disorders than White people, they face greater disparities in getting help due to institutional discrimination and interpersonal racism and stigma. Black, indigenous and people of color are significantly less likely than White people to have been asked by a doctor about eating disorder symptoms, and are half as likely to be diagnosed or to receive treatment, according to a report by the US National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. Halima Eid, a licensed professional clinical counselor and co-founder of AMALY, a California-based non-profit organization that aims to challenge the stigma around mental health in Muslim communities, said it can be hard for people in those spaces to access the information they need.  Eid established AMALY in 2020 to offer accessible therapy services, workshops, support groups and educational talks that are tailored to her local Muslim community in San Diego, California.  She also offers services online that extend to Muslims globally.  Last spring, she set up a virtual support group to help Muslims with eating disorders as they navigate Ramadan. She said that after the screening process about 30 people initially registered across two cohorts, including Muslims from the US, Australia and the UK. She intends to run the same group this year. ""It is a very lonely experience to suffer from any disease or disorder on your own,"" she said. ""Then there's the guilt that they're not pleasing Allah and they're not being good Muslims. So, we challenge perfectionism in Islam, perfectionism as Muslims during Ramadan, because a lot of people struggle."" Both Eid and Naseem, the UK-based counseling psychologist, use their Islamic and medical knowledge to serve Muslims that seek support from mental health professionals, who have a similar lived experience as women who practice Islam. ""I can offer a unique perspective ... it helps you use your skill set for good to groups that maybe wouldn't engage or wouldn't feel comfortable speaking to somebody who isn't from their background,"" said Naseem, who has created a Ramadan guide offering nutrition and faith-based advice for Muslims with eating disorders. Breaking a cycle of shame  Habiba says her bulimia reached a turning point several years ago, when she returned home from a friend's baby shower and made herself sick after eating cakes and sweet treats. ""I remember just looking at my body and being like, I don't like this. I don't like the way that I look and I don't think I'm ever going to love myself, but I think I just need to accept it,"" she said. ""I don't know if I can ever say that I'm fully recovered. I know that I still have that voice ... in my head. But it's quieter now."" Now, she said she is able to keep her eating disorder at bay by identifying her triggers and forcing herself to eat when she is drawn towards restrictive dieting patterns.  Ramadan and Eid celebrations can trigger her eating disorder, she said, because she experienced pressure to eat large amounts of food at iftar, and received judgmental comments from family members who might not understand her decision not to fast. Hasan, the Bristol-based research psychologist, said Muslims in their position need ""social acceptance"" from community leaders. ""A lot of stress and mental toll would be reduced if we had acceptance and acknowledgment in the community that people struggle in different ways, and we should understand and accept them, instead of stigmatising them,"" she said. Habiba said she still misses the communal aspect of breaking fasts during Ramadan, attending family dinners and counting down the days until Eid al-Fitr, the festivities that mark the end of Ramadan.  ""I do feel like I'm left out of the club,"" Habiba said, adding that she hopes she'll get to a point in the future where she can fast again and be sure that her faith, rather than a desire to restrict her calorie intake, is her motivation. Ali, the Atlanta-based Imam and counselor, suggested ways that Muslims with eating disorders can engage with the holy month aside from fasting, including reading the Quran, attending nightly taraweeh prayers, and donating to a feeding program.  He said faith leaders and family members should acknowledge the challenges Muslims with mental health struggles face during Ramadan, and offer them guidance to help break the intergenerational cycle of shame and guilt that exists across society. ""Islam is a religion that does not want people to jeopardize their lives to engage in forms of worship,"" he said. ""I think the important thing is for us religious leaders to be able to show empathy to the least among us, the most vulnerable among us.""

                      Fantasy freaks and noble nerds unite.  Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Wednesday that the 'Game of Thrones' and 'Harry Potter' franchises will take on new life at the studio's newly minted streaming service Max.  For those who are eager to soar back into the wizarding world of 'Harry Potter,' buckle up because the franchise is coming to Max in the form of a scripted television series. (CNN and Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) The series will be a ""faithful adaptation"" of the beloved ""Harry Potter"" books by author J.K. Rowling, who will also serve as an executive producer on the project, according to a news release. Rowling's ""Potter"" books were published between 1997 and 2007.  The television series will feature a cast of fresh new faces to take on the roles made famous in the ""Potter"" films by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.  The series is expected to run for an unprecedented 10 years with the promise that each season ""will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core.""  Over in Westeros, Max will launch a second prequel series in the ""Game of Thrones"" universe, titled ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight"" based on author George R.R. Martin's 2013 ""Dunk and Egg"" novellas.  The prequel is set a century before the events of the original ""Game of Thrones,"" which ran from 2011 to 2019, and will center on the wanderings of ""two unlikely heroes,"" Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg, according to a news release. ""Set in an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living memory, great destinies, powerful foes, and dangerous exploits all await these improbable and incomparable friends,"" the release said.   The announcement for a new ""Thrones"" prequel comes after ""House of the Dragon"" debuted in 2022. ""Dragon"" is also a prequel series, based on the Targaryen civil war and set nearly 200 years prior to ""Game of Thrones."" It's based on Martin's ""Fire & Blood"" book from 2018.   Release dates for both new series have not yet been announced.

""He should be traveling in a 2022 grey BMW and his last known location is potentially the area of Mainland High School on 4/12/2023,"" according to the post. ""He is considered missing and endangered."" The stars legal name is Jared Drake Bell. CNN has reached out to representatives for the police department and Bell for additional information. The 36-year-old actor's social media accounts have not been updated since April 3, when his verified Twitter account had a post of his interview with YouTuber Roberto Mtz.  On Instagram, his most recent posts include video of his infant son, shared by Drake's wife, Janet Von Schmeling, dated March 6. Bell starred on Nickelodeon's ""The Amanda Show"" and ""Drake & Josh"" in the early 2000s.  In 2021, he pleaded guilty to sending sexually explicit texts to a 15-year-old girl and was sentenced to probation.

                      A court hearing was held in Los Angeles on Thursday related to the petition Priscilla Presley filed in January that challenges the validity of her daughter, Lisa Marie Presley's will.  Priscilla Presley did not appear at the hearing, nor did her grandaughter, actor Riley Keough, who is the primary beneficiary of Lisa Marie Presley's estate. The court on Thursday considered an ex parte petition filed by Michael Lockwood, the father of Lisa Marie Presley's youngest daughters, twins Finley and Harper, to be named their guardian ad litem regarding their late mother's will. Scott Rahn, Lockwood's lawyer, said he is ""ready, able and willing to protect their interests.""  Attorneys for Priscilla Presley and Riley Keough did not contest Lockwood being named their guardian ad litem. Judge Lynn Healy Scaduto said she would issue a written ruling on the matter. Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis Presley's only child, died in January after being hospitalized following an apparent cardiac arrest at her Los Angeles home.  In a court filing obtained by CNN, Priscilla Presley's petition disputes a 2016 amendment to her daughter's will which states that Lisa Marie Presley removed her mother and former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees, replacing them with her children Riley and Benjamin Keough. Benjamin Keough later died in 2020. The petition alleges that Priscilla Presley did not receive the amendment while her daughter was alive, as required by her Trust, and that the document misspells Priscilla's name. The petition also alleged that the amendment was not witnessed or notarized and questioned the authenticity of Lisa Marie Presley's signature.  Attorneys for Priscilla Presley filed the petition just days after Lisa Marie Presley was laid to rest at Elvis's former residence, Graceland. The next hearing to address the matter is scheduled for May 16.

                      To Kate and Oliver Hudson, family is everything.  So much so that the siblings started a podcast together in 2019 called ""Sibling Revelry,"" which has featured over 100 guests and launched a new season on Wednesday.  The podcast ""explores the sibling bond, family dynamics, the human mind, body, and so much more,"" according to the website, and the famous pair's vulnerable and open approach to embracing their own dynamic as siblings -- they are the children of Goldie Hawn and estranged father Bill Hudson -- has inspired their many podcast guests to share about the inner workings of their own family and sibling dynamics. ""I think we're both pretty comfortable feeling vulnerable, talking about insecurities,"" Kate Hudson told CNN in an interview, adding that ""when you can open up with those insecurities or vulnerabilities, it's actually a strength.""   Kate and Oliver Hudson have spoken with everyone from Mary and Stella McCartney, the daughters of Beatles legend Paul McCartney, to Kate Hudson's ""Almost Famous"" co-star Billy Crudup and his brothers Tommy and Brooks. In the new season, they speak with Matthew and Rooster McConaughey, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and his brother Suneel, and sisters Barbara Bush and Jenna Hager.  The conversations on ""Sibling Revelry"" tend to be joyous, insightful and hilarious, and offer a refreshing take on navigating life with a built-in best friend. Read on to learn more about how the Hudsons' sibling chemistry led to ""Sibling Revelry.""  The conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. CNN: What is it about your sibling dynamic that lends itself to some of the more revealing conversations that you have had? Oliver Hudson: I think it's honestly how candid we are, and how open we are with our feelings. I feel like we're unafraid to sort of talk about our relationship and how we view the things that we've been through, and it helps people to open up a little bit.  Kate Hudson: Yeah. And vulnerability. I think we're both pretty comfortable feeling vulnerable, talking about insecurities. When you can open up with those insecurities or vulnerabilities, it's actually a strength.  And that's how we grew up, being very open with our feelings. I've always felt even outside of our podcast that I've got nothing to hide. And then I did our podcast and I realized there definitely is things I'd like to hide.  OH: The beauty of podcasts is to say, 'Well, we're going to cut that.' KH: So as open as we are, there are things where I'm like, 'Oh, we really went a little too far on that one, too revealing.' OH: But I think most people probably come in with some sort of a guard up, but the minute that they feel comfortable and they see that you are able to tell your truth and not be afraid of it, I think it puts people at ease and allows them to open up a little bit more. KH: And I think that as hard and as challenging as certain things can be in a family dynamic, when you have laughter, if you're able to have some self humor, if you're able to be somewhat self deprecating, if you're able to face your own shortcomings, you can actually have a better sense of humor about them. And that's something that's got Oliver and I through a lot, is laughter. And thinking about where the world is right now, I was thinking about this yesterday when starting to do prep for the podcast. Our world is so unpredictable. There's so much that's unpredictable right now. And when you really think about what matters, what's going to keep you feeling good, it kind of really does start at home with your family and with the connections that you have with the people you love. And we have to nurture that. And I think the more we nurture that the better the world becomes. Like the more we nurture our small community that we have, that we all have, I think the better the larger community becomes.  OH: And it's hard too, because sometimes you talk to siblings who have had maybe issues with other siblings, and there's a division there. But depending on the situation, it's an important relationship to mend, I think. Because at the end of the day, I tell my kids this when they're all yelling at each other, I'm like, 'This is all you got!' You know what I mean? At the end of the day, this is your tribe, you know? So make sure that you nurture this and understand.  CNN: Speaking of kids, have you learned anything from the conversations you've had with your guests that have informed you on dynamics you want to apply as parents to your children?  KH: Yes. Oh, completely! Also just the different parenting styles that people have experienced where (I'm) like, 'God that's great.' Like, someone who completely came from a completely different sort of parenting style/background. OH: And some of the experts that we bring on too are extremely insightful. Ron Howard pops into my mind. With the way he grew up with his family who have a bunch of actors and it's, like a whole thing.  KH: He's so great. We had Dr. Shefali on who did a book called ""The Conscious Parent."" And that was really insightful. I left that podcast really taking a lot from her about how we actually heal our own wounds as we raise our children, by looking deeper into ourselves and our reactivity towards the things that our children are doing.  OH: It's also about respecting the way that everyone does it because everyone does it differently, even including my sister and I. Kate and I parent differently.  KH: Super different.  OH: But we respect the way that we do it. And when my kids are with Kate, she does it one way and they come home and they're like, 'Auntie Kate did this, this and this...' And then I'm like, 'Well, don't go over there!' It's her rules man, if you're not feeling it, then I don't know what to do. And then her kids come to my house and I get yelled at by Kate like, 'What are you doing?!'  CNN: What conversations have you both had with each other and with your guests that have surprised you? OH: There's a surprise in every show really, honestly. Everyone's story is so unique. And you may go in there thinking you're going to hear the same thing over and over again, but that's just never the case. There's always something that's extremely relatable. The overall surprise for me is how this podcast and the decision to do it has brought my sister and I closer together in that we're more expressive, we're able to talk about things that you don't really talk about around a dinner table or in your everyday world. So it sparks a lot of interesting conversation between us and we're able to even get into it on the air, just about some of the issues that the guests bring up that are relatable to us. So for me, that's what it is.  KH: For me, moving forward, it's no longer a surprise because now we really understand it. Because by now, we've interviewed over I think 100. But it is how perception plays such a part in challenging relationships in the home, that everybody has a different perception of how something happened in their life, or even a circumstance that a sibling can remember in a completely different way. And how that can create conflict or how that informs how you resolve conflict. Now we know there is not one perception of anything. Like we all grow up with a different way of perceiving things.   OH: It's so interesting. It's based on age and where you are in the pecking order of the siblings status. Taye Diggs, on one of the early ones, he and his brother growing up had completely different perspectives on how they were raised and who their father was to them. Like night and day. It's really amazing. It's a good point, you know, just that filter.  KH: And in the beginning that really surprised me. And now I'm like, oh, the center of most conflict usually does come down to when people argue about how something was or how something went down versus the overall experience.  CNN: How do you prep for your interviews? Do you talk beforehand and decide who's going to ask questions based on who's better at a certain topic, or who's friendlier with the guests that you have? How do you map it all out? OH: It's actually a good question because, again, it's a night and day thing. Kate's got the prep and--- KH: My notes, I like to read stuff.  OH: And I read over but I'm more off the cuff like, let's just fly.   KH: He's like, what's your name again? OH: But no, I like the spontaneity of it and then Kate brings us back on the tracks. I make hard left and right turns.  KH: It's a really good dynamic actually because Oliver is hilarious and witty and lovable and does make the hard left, hard right. And I usually have fun with it and then bring it back on the road.  OH: I think authentically, Kate and I are who we are on this show. It really is, otherwise it would just sound sort of false if it was more structured, I think. She's got her structure, I'm a little nutty. We sort of see where it takes us. KH: Oliver loves to challenge experts.   OH: Yeah.  KH: And I'm like, 'Ollie, they're an expert. Yeah, you don't know what you're talking about.'  CNN: It looks like you have some exciting guests lined up for the season. What or who are you most excited about? KH: I mean, honestly, just being back on the air and our listeners. I'm excited to come back and kind of re-engage with our audience. And we really love our audience, they're so loyal. Anytime someone comes up to me and they talk about loving the podcast, it always ends in a great conversation about which one they loved and why and their own experience. And I'm really excited about that. We get letters, emails come in that inspire Oliver and I and really move us.  OH: Yeah, and I think these episodes and the seasons are a reflection of what we're interested in too. So when you're hearing a guest, it's not just pulling a guest out of thin air. It's like ooh, we're into this. We're into all of the things and all the guests, it's a reflection of what we want to learn as well.

                      Jury selection begins in historic Dominion defamation trial against Fox News

                      Jury selection began Thursday in Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation trial against Fox News over the right-wing network's promotion of debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Roughly 300 potential jurors have been summoned to the Delaware Superior Court and will eventually be whittled down to a panel of 12 jurors and a group of alternates. The high-stakes trial — which will put a spotlight on Fox's 2020 election denialism and the role of disinformation in American politics — is expected to last about six weeks. Jurors will be peppered with questions about their news consumption habits, including whether they watch Fox News. But Judge Eric Davis has narrowed the scope of the questioning — he doesn't want jurors to be asked if they believe the 2020 election was legitimate, or if they had any connection to the January 6 insurrection. If a jury isn't seated Thursday, the process will continue Friday. Opening statements are scheduled for Monday. The case revolves around Fox's decision, after Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election, to allow haywire conspiracy theories about Dominion onto its airwaves. The allegations, levied by Fox guests and embraced by some Fox hosts, falsely claimed Dominion and its voting software flipped millions of ballots away from Trump, to steal the election. Dominion has argued that Fox destroyed its reputation as a trusted voting technology company by repeatedly amplifying these false claims. Emails and texts unearthed during the litigation have shown that many Fox hosts, producers, and top executives privately believed the claims on their airwaves were preposterous and untrue. High bar, high stakes In recent weeks, Dominion's case has picked up steam, though it's still a high bar to prove defamation. The company will need to convince the jury that people at Fox acted with ""actual malice"" — they knew what was being said on-air was false but broadcast it anyway, or they acted with such a reckless disregard for the truth that they should be held liable. The judge has already rejected several First Amendment defenses that Fox hoped to invoke, and he further constrained Fox in a flurry of pretrial rulings this week, stopping the right-wing network from trying to argue that the allegedly defamatory statements were ""newsworthy"" and thus deserved coverage. An in an 11th-hour twist, the judge sanctioned Fox on Wednesday for withholding evidence from Dominion, and said he'd assign an outside attorney to investigate whether Fox misled the court and deliberately hid any additional material from Dominion. Fox News says it didn't defame Dominion and maintains that it is still ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage. The right-wing network also denied that it withheld any evidence from Dominion. ""Dominion's lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights,"" a Fox spokesperson said in a statement. ""While Dominion has pushed irrelevant and misleading information to generate headlines, Fox News remains steadfast in protecting the rights of a free press, given a verdict for Dominion and its private equity owners would have grave consequences for the entire journalism profession.""

McConaughey added that the pair are ""on the precipice"" of doing DNA tests to verify their suspicions, but that he was more reluctant than Harrelson in case he discovered that his father might not be his biological parent ""after 53 years of believing that."" The pair are appearing in the comedy series ""Brother From Another Mother"" for Apple TV+, a fictionalized portrayal of their own friendship.  The two actors first met in 1997 while working on Ron Howard's ""EDtv,"" although they disagree about the precise moment.

                      Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday unveiled ""Max,"" its high-stakes super-streamer that unites some of the company's most storied brands under one roof and aims to aggressively compete in the streaming marketplace as the traditional linear television business rapidly declines. The new service, announced by CEO David Zaslav at a press event Wednesday, will launch May 23 and give consumers access to a large library of programming across Warner Bros. Discovery's sprawling portfolio: Warner Bros., HBO, HGTV, Food Network, Cartoon Network, TLC and others. ""It's the one to watch,"" Zaslav said, referencing the service's tagline, ""because we have so many of the world's iconic and globally recognized franchises. It's our superpower."" The streaming platform is a service ""every member of the household"" can go to for entertainment, he added. Max subscribers can choose from three price tiers. The least expensive is $9.99 a month and will show ads. The ad-free version will cost $15.99, the price of the company's existing HBO Max service. That tier will let customers stream on two devices at once and download up to 30 titles, but the content will be available only in high-definition rather than 4K. Users who want the higher-resolution 4K streams will have to buy the Max ""ultimate plan"" for $19.99 a month, which includes up to four concurrent streams, 100 downloads and Dolby Atmos sound. Existing HBO Max customers will be transitioned to the new service without any action on their part. Those users, said, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. Discovery told CNN, can keep existing features like 4K HDR resolution for a limited period before being prompted to move into the ""ultimate plan."" The Max platform was born of the mega-merger announced between WarnerMedia and Discovery in 2021 and completed last year. Warner Bros. Discovery is also the parent company of CNN. 'Attack plan' for news and sports Company executives have touted the combined streaming service as unique in its content mix: It packages award-winning prestige programming like HBO's ""Succession"" and ""House of the Dragon"" with unscripted shows like HGTV's ""Fixer Upper"" and TLC's ""90 Day Fiancé."" Zaslav also hinted that news and sports programming will factor into the service in the future, given that Warner Bros. Discovery owns properties such as Turner Sports and CNN. ""We are a global leader in sports and we are a global leader in news,"" Zaslav said. ""And in a few months we will come back to you on our attack plan to use this important and differentiating content to grow our streaming business even further."" The Max service represents the future for Warner Bros. Discovery, which has been entrenched in a traditional TV business that is declining as audiences switch to streaming.  Other companies enmeshed in the cable business have also moved in recent years to launch streaming platforms, including Disney, NBC, and Paramount. But none of these companies have achieved the success of Netflix, which pioneered the streaming business and has more than 230 million global subscribers. Warner Bros. Discovery hopes that it will amass 130 million subscribers by 2025. At the launch event, the company's streaming chief Jean-Briac Perrette discussed several improvements to the HBO Max interface to increase retention and engagement, adding that the company had invested in machine learning so home feeds can recommend content using a ""human-plus-machine approach."" But subscriber growth for streaming services has slowed in recent years as the market becomes more saturated. Some companies have introduced lower-priced ad-supported plans to draw people in.  Increasingly, executives have moved to highlight profitability over subscriber growth as the most important barometer for a company's success. Netflix even announced last year that it would stop providing guidance for its membership, stating that the company is ""increasingly focused on revenue as our primary top-line metric.""

                      Dylan Mulvaney is a uniquely 21st-century star. She became famous on TikTok, where she pivoted from musical theater to advocacy when she came out as trans. She's scored major brand sponsorships and made the jump to fame off-platform, even interviewing President Joe Biden.  Her online persona is an overwhelmingly positive one. But when she started posting videos sponsored by Bud Light, Olay and Nike, her accounts became flooded with anti-trans hate.  CNN has reached out to Mulvaney's representatives for comment. Mulvaney's brand partnerships have triggered a new wave of anti-trans attacks. Many of those critics -- including celebrities and members of Congress -- misgender, degrade and even threaten her in their comments. Her response, so far, has been to tune them out, even when the hateful rhetoric escalates. Mulvaney became a pandemic-era TikTok star Mulvaney started her career in the theater, touring across North America as one of the principal cast members of the hit musical ""The Book of Mormon."" But in 2020, when the pandemic canceled most in-person events, Mulvaney turned to TikTok. She posted cheerful and informative clips about her life as a queer person. After cultivating a sizable following during the pandemic, Mulvaney came out as a trans woman in March 2022. She was ""scared and a little bit ashamed to even consider (herself) back on the binary,"" she told fans -- she had come out as nonbinary earlier during the pandemic -- but ultimately realized she wanted to ""honor that inner child"" who knew for years she was a girl.  Thus began her TikTok series ""Days of Girlhood,"" in which she documented almost every day of her transition, from her experience with hormone-replacement therapy to hatred from anti-trans opponents to the results of her facial feminization surgery, or FFS.  Other notable moments include day 221, on which Mulvaney interviewed President Joe Biden for Now This News and asked Biden whether he supported states' rights to ban gender-affirming health care. He told her he didn't support it, citing his late son, then-Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, who advocated for measures that would protect trans residents of Delaware. And on day 279, the day before her surgery, she said she was doxxed, meaning a viewer leaked her home address online without her consent. She celebrated day 365 in March with a live performance at Rockefeller Center's Rainbow Room, with proceeds donated to the Trevor Project, an LGBTQ suicide prevention organization.  Big brand partnerships draw anti-trans ire With her growing popularity online, Mulvaney began partnering with big brands, including Kate Spade, the natural deodorant company Native and the hair care line Olaplex. But a brief digital ad for Bud Light caused some fans of the brand to send a deluge of anti-trans hate her way.  In the clip, filmed shortly after she celebrated day 365, Mulvaney joked that she didn't know what March Madness was but planned to enjoy it with a can of Bud Light. The brand also sent her a personalized can with her face on it. Bud Light's sponsorship of Mulvaney caused some anti-trans critics to call for a boycott of the brand. Kid Rock filmed himself shooting cases of the beer, ending his video with ""f**k Bud Light and f**k Anheuser-Busch."" GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas called the ad ""stupid"" in an Instagram video in which he said he would ""throw out every single Bud Light in the fridge"" only to open his garage mini fridge and find no Bud Light cans. However, there were several Karbach beers in the fridge, which is a brand owned by Anheuser-Busch, Bud Light's parent company. The Daily Beast wrote that Crenshaw's attempts at a boycott ""failed."" In a statement to outlets including Rolling Stone and Buzzfeed, Anheuser-Busch said earlier this month: ""Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics. From time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public."" Bud Light has not posted to its Instagram account since before Mulvaney shared her ad on April 1.  Similar anti-trans hate followed after Mulvaney posted an ad for Nike this month. The sportswear brand responded with a comment on one of its recent Instagram posts that doesn't contain any images of Mulvaney after countless Instagram users flooded the comment section with negativity toward Mulvaney. ""You are an essential component to the success of your community! We welcome comments that contribute to a positive and constructive discussion,"" Nike wrote in the comment, pinned to the top of the post. ""Be kind (heart emoji) Be inclusive (heart emoji) Encourage each other (heart emoji).""  Mulvaney also recently appeared in a TikTok ad for Olay that caused some anti-trans users to call for a brand boycott.  The backlash has also drawn some high-profile figures, including Howard Stern and Rosie O'Donnell, to speak out in support of Mulvaney. ""As long as you ain't hurting anybody, I'm on your team,"" Stern said during an episode of his Sirius XM radio show. The vitriol aimed at the TikTok star is just the latest in a growing trend of hatred aimed at queer and trans people in the US. Data from the ACLU shows that, as of April 3, a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced this year -- 417 in 2023, compared to 180 bills last year -- and many of them are aimed at trans young people trying to access gender-affirming health care. Mulvaney has spoken about how the gender-affirming care she's received has ""brought (her) so much peace"" and should be more widely available to trans people who seek it.  Mulvaney says she tries to tune out anti-trans hate In an interview with Rolling Stone last week, Mulvaney said that while she first tried to give her anti-trans critics a chance, she realized their positions were rooted in ""pure hatred.""  ""I've now made a little bit of peace with the fact that people have a problem with my transness or with my joy,"" she told Rolling Stone earlier this month. ""And that's on them. That has nothing to do with me, and I have to think about the people that I look up to that celebrate this version of myself. Those are the people I should be listening to."" She posted a more succinct message on her social profiles.  ""This song felt fitting given the week I've had,"" she wrote in a caption accompanying a clip of her Day 365 performance, in which she sang ""No One is Alone"" from the musical ""Into the Woods."" ""Thank you all for making me feel supported, I am not alone.""

                      Dwight Frye is hardly a household name, but the character actor left his mark on Universal horror movies of the 1930s, including his portrayal of Dracula's maniacal henchman in the Bela Legosi classic. Enter ""Renfield,"" a cheeky homage to the vampire genre that blends horror and comedy into a beyond-bloody cocktail, with Nicholas Hoult and Nicolas Cage sinking their teeth into the too-thin material. Produced and conceived by Robert Kirkman of ""The Walking Dead"" renown, ""Renfield"" begins promisingly enough, with Hoult's Renfield -- Dracula's ""familiar,"" or the human servant who tends to his daytime needs -- sitting in on a support group for people in abusive relationships. There's also a spot-on replication of the old black-and-white movies, with just the smallest hint of Renfield's wheezing laugh. Those wrinkles, however, amount to false advertising for a movie that derives most of its humor from over-the-top gore, an amusing-in-theory notion that inevitably yields diminishing returns even spread over a relatively brisk 90-some-odd minutes. ""Renfield"" is so much better when the film is having fun with vampire-movie minutia -- like Dracula (Cage) needing to be invited into places, or the particulars of how to kill him -- that the broadness of those visual gags make it feel like an underachiever, especially when compared to something that gets the balance right, like the FX series ""What We Do in the Shadows."" Directed by Chris McKay (""The LEGO Batman Movie"") from a script by Ryan Ridley, ""Renfield"" also introduces a sort-of relationship between its title character and a principled cop, Rebecca (Awkwafina, underemployed here), who brings out his desire to be a better man. Then again, he's already exhibited those impulses by having sought to steer his boss toward more-deserving victims, while Dracula thirsts for nuns and cheerleaders. The makeup effects are bountiful and fairly impressive, with Renfield deriving super-human strength from consuming insects, which he gets to put into use against the mobsters Rebecca is obsessed with putting behind bars. Yet the way those visual elements are applied does more to narrow the movie's appeal than expand it, catering to a subset of the horror audience at the expense of those who might show up expecting something closer to a Mel Brooks-like spoof. What's billed as a horror-comedy thus can't entirely decide where it wishes to land on that spectrum, in a movie that benefits from letting Cage cut loose without fully capitalizing upon his full-throated performance. Universal has creatively sought to mine equity from its monster library, and ""Renfield"" certainly brings those efforts into the 21st century, for better and worse. And while Renfield might be trapped in a ""destructive relationship"" with a cruel and demanding master, the filmmakers have only themselves to blame for their questionable choices. ""Renfield"" premieres April 14 in US theaters. It's rated R.

                      The curtain is coming down on ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,"" whose act -- an Emmy winner in its first season -- has seen better days. Having left its mark for Amazon, the nostalgic comedy tries to bring home the story of its central character without venturing far from the rat-a-tat tone that defined the series initially, and that by season five, has grown tedious. Reflecting that the end is nigh, several of the episodes incorporate flash-forwards, providing a tantalizing taste of the future Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) and how her showbiz career (and by extension, life) has gone. That journey begins with Midge's agent, Susie (Alex Borstein), trying to land her a job writing for the latenight TV show hosted by Gordon Ford (Reid Scott, an excellent regular addition), a thinly veiled stand-in for Johnny Carson who is going toe-to-toe with Carson's predecessor, Jack Paar. Midge's interactions within that male-dominated bastion introduce a nice hook for the new season, which now takes place, largely, in the early 1960s. Midge also deals with a lot of the usual mishegas involving her parents (Tony Shalhoub, Marin Hinkle) and in-laws (Kevin Pollak, Caroline Aaron), while her ex-husband Joel (Michael Zegen) wrestles with his own issues after their split. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino specializes in characters that all tend to speak with the same witty voice, and exposing Midge to comics and comedy writers makes that tick feel a little less conspicuous. It's also interesting getting a glimpse of where Midge wound up, as well as the influence that her rising star had on those around her. For the most part, though, the last few seasons of ""Mrs. Maisel"" have felt like a comic stalling for time, vamping until the next act can make it to the mic. The initial conceit of a woman stumbling into standup in the 1950s possessed a clear charm -- particularly with Lenny Bruce's in-and-out presence, as played by Luke Kirby -- that the series often lacked as Midge settled into the business, facing the various challenges and impediments thrown her way. Despite the quality of the cast and the knowing winks to the excesses and sexism of its era, ""Mrs. Maisel"" has always felt like a particularly light construct, which is why the prospect of a final season in theory provides the show with a level of focus and momentum it has lacked. And to some extent, that's true. Having come this far, there's inevitable curiosity about what the world held for a promising female comic who had the audacity to start slinging jokes in the Eisenhower era. But watching these episodes, with their detours and digressions, it seems fairly clear that for better or worse, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" can't stray too far from the comfort of its old routine. ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" begins its fifth and final season April 14 with three new episodes on Amazon's Prime Video.

                      Everything old is new again. Warner Bros. Discovery unveiled its super-streamer, Max, to the world on Wednesday, with Chief Executive David Zaslav touting the platform as a service ""every member of the household"" can go to for their television needs. Max unites some of the industry's most storied brands under one roof, giving consumers access to a library of programming across WBD's sprawling portfolio: films by Warner Bros., children's content from Cartoon Network, premium shows by HBO and unscripted programming from HGTV, TLC, Food Network and many others. Zaslav signaled the package will also at some point be infused with news and sports, given that WBD owns properties such as Turner Sports and CNN. In effect, WBD announced that it is recreating the bundle, erecting the pillars of a one-stop shop for scripted and unscripted television, movies, news and sports at a flat monthly rate. The only meaningful difference: instead of it being distributed through cable by a third-party, it will be transmitted direct-to-consumer over the internet. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.  ""It's the one to watch because we have so many of the world's iconic and globally recognized franchises,"" Zaslav said at the press event, both referencing the service's new tagline and also leaning into the concept of a bundle that marries all the elements of traditional linear television. ""It's our superpower,"" Zaslav added, describing the package as ""streaming's version of must-see TV."" It's a notably different approach from what Disney has done in the streaming space. Insider Intelligence analyst Paul Verna noted to me that the WBD competitor has ""resisted the temptation"" to combine Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. Instead, Verna observed that Disney is ""leaning into each brand's core strength,"" though Disney does offer the ability to purchase the individual services in a bundle.  ""WBD has clearly decided on the opposite approach,"" Verna said. Which company is ultimately proven to have the more effective strategy remains to be seen. But it goes without saying that Max — the product of the merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery — represents the future for WBD, which has been entrenched in the declining traditional TV business. Zaslav nodded at this during the press event, saying that Max positions the company for the ""next century."" For now, Max's pricing will be divided up into three tiers: The least expensive is the $9.99 ad-supported model, while the ad-free version will cost $15.99, matching the price of the existing HBO Max service. Users who want 4K will have to buy the Max ""ultimate plan"" for $19.99. The Max service launches May 23.

                      One year after the start of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's highly publicized defamation trial, CNN has learned from sources close to the actors that the former couple has moved on from their legal battle.  Their dramatic televised trial in Virginia began last April and concluded in June, when the jury in the case found both Heard and Depp liable for defamation in their lawsuits against each other. Depp was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million dollars in punitive damages. The jury awarded Heard $2 million in compensatory damages and no money for punitive damages. In December, Heard announced that she and Depp had settled their defamation suit, writing on Instagram that she had ""made no admission"" and that the settlement is ""not an act of concession.""  ""I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder,"" Heard said in her post. Damages owed to Depp by Heard were reduced to $1 million as part of the agreement, which Depp's attorneys said in a statement at the time he pledged to donate to charity. ""We are pleased to formally close the door on this painful chapter for Mr. Depp, who made clear throughout the process that his priority was about bringing the truth to light,"" said Depp's attorneys Benjamin Chew and Camille Vasquez. CNN has contacted representatives for Heard and Depp to inquire if the settlement and charitable payments have been made. More recently, both actors have been photographed spending time in Europe, with Depp in England and Heard on the island of Mallorca in Spain.  ""After the trial Johnny started working on a new film project and he's been touring with his band,"" an individual close to Depp told CNN. ""Everything is going really great."" A source close to Heard confirmed she was living on the Spanish island with her daughter and partner, Bianca Butti. ""She's just focused on being a mom right now,"" the individual close to Heard told CNN. ""The trial took an emotional toll on her and she just wanted to get away from the noise and disappear from Hollywood."" Heard's next movie project is ""Aquaman 2,"" which is due out in December. During her testimony last summer, she stated that she believed her role had been greatly reduced in the film due to negative publicity around her split from Depp. (The two stars were married from 2015 to 2016.) Warner Bros., the studio behind the ""Aquaman"" franchise, declined to comment on the matter at the time. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of Warner Bros. Discovery.) Depp has been touring and performing with his band Hollywood Vampires. His next film project is starring as King Louis XV in the film ""Jeanne Du Barry,"" set to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 16.

                      Calling all cute pet lovers, i.e., everyone. The Instagram account for a certain Mini Sheepadoodle named Bayley is going viral, thanks to the adorable black-and-white pooch's astounding and uncanny resemblance to Snoopy, the canine mascot for the Peanuts cartoon troupe. Bayley, who according to the pup's Instagram page will be two years old next month, sports the same oblong face as Snoopy, along with the exact same color distribution -- a white face and muzzle, adorable round black nose and furry, floppy black ears. The pooch is also surprisingly photogenic, posing calmly for perfect photos and video throughout the pet-centric social media page. While Snoopy is known to be a beagle, Bayley's breed of Mini Sheepadoodle -- the result of crossing an Old English Sheepdog with a Miniature Poodle -- has resulted in a near carbon copy of the drawn animal, in real life. Snoopy is the famously silent dog that originated in the ""Peanuts"" comic strip by Charles M. Schulz in October of 1950. He also appeared in various ""Peanuts"" television specials, and has been a fixture as a giant balloon in New York City's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Snoopy is showing up elsewhere in the news on Wednesday, as a t-shirt sporting his personage is gaining in popularity as part of a nationwide American Red Cross-led effort to drive up blood donations.  On Tuesday, on the occasion of National Pet Day, Bayley's owner posted yet another irresistible snippet of the gorgeous animal, along with the caption, ""Mom says I am the cutest pet she has ever seen but to be fair, I am her first and the only furbaby.""

                      Judge in Dominion case sanctions Fox for withholding evidence, plans to appoint special master to probe possible misconduct

                      The judge overseeing Dominion Voting Systems' massive defamation case against Fox News said Wednesday that he plans to appoint an outside attorney to investigate whether the right-wing network lied to the court and withheld key evidence, and sanctioned Fox over the matter. ""I am very concerned... that there have been misrepresentations to the court. This is very serious,"" Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said Wednesday at a pretrial hearing in Wilmington, where he repeatedly expressed exasperation and frustration with Fox's attorneys. The sanction Davis imposed against Fox will allow Dominion to conduct additional depositions of some Fox witnesses, if they want to, at this late stage in the case. Fox must make those witnesses available and pay for the depositions. These extraordinary moves, on the brink of trial, are the latest blows to Fox News as it tries to fend off the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit that Dominion filed over the network's promotion of the false claim that its voting software rigged the 2020 election. Jury selection is set to begin Thursday, with opening statements following on Monday. Davis said he would appoint a so-called ""special master"" to investigate whether Fox previously made assertions to the court that were ""untrue or negligent."" The special master's inquiry appears to be twofold: First, Did Fox withhold key materials from Dominion during the discovery process? And second, did Fox mislead the court by obfuscating Rupert Murdoch's role at Fox News? Fox had previously told Dominion and the judge that Murdoch was only an officer at Fox Corporation and didn't have any role in Fox News. Dominion says this distinction may have narrowed what Fox turned over as part of the discovery process -- like internal emails, text messages and other material. Fox denies that it ever defamed Dominion, and says it properly disclosed Murdoch's roles in its public financial filings. Fox attorney Dan Webb said at Wednesday's hearing that ""nobody intentionally withheld information"" from Dominion. 11th-hour drama  The special master will look into what sanctions might be appropriate against Fox, including potentially instructing jurors that Fox inappropriately blocked Dominion from obtaining key evidence. Fox said it would oppose this move, and the judge said he'll decide later in the case. I'm very uncomfortable right now,"" Davis said, after dressing down Fox's lawyers from the bench. The judge ordered Fox lawyers to preserve ""any and all communications"" related to the Murdoch issue, expressing alarm that they may have deliberately provided him with inaccurate information. The 11th-hour drama escalated Wednesday when Dominion played previously unaired tapes of Fox News host Maria Bartiromo talking in November 2020 with then-Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. In the tapes, Giuliani told Bartiromo he ""can't prove"" some of his allegations about Dominion, and Bartiromo expressed interest in promoting Powell's fundraising website on her broadcast. Dominion lawyer Davida Brook said Fox had only turned over the material last week, after Bartiromo's former senior producer Abby Grossberg revealed in a lawsuit that the recordings existed. ""We keep on finding out about missing documents in this case, not from Fox, but from others,"" Brook said. The judge agreed that the material was ""extremely relevant"" and chided Fox yet again, in what has become a near-daily occurrence as the case careens toward trial. ""Abby Grossberg is not Dominion's problem. It's not my problem. Abby Grossberg is a Fox problem. She was an employee at Fox. She is relevant to the case,"" Davis said. ""These tape recordings... they relate directly to one of the statements we are litigating... The question is, are there other documents like that out there?"" A Fox lawyer said that the company had given Dominion more than a million documents and denied that it tried to suppress any evidence in the case. ""As counsel explained to the Court, Fox produced the supplemental information from Ms. Grossberg when we first learned it,"" a Fox spokesperson said in a statement after the hearing.

                      More than a decade ago, music writer and singer Jozzy agreed to go to Miami to work with a producer for a week. Five years later, she was still there and well on her way to a career that would land her working with the likes of Beyoncé and Chris Martin, along with Grammy nominations.  Jozzy is now working hard as the first artist from Diddy's Love Records label and recently released her debut EP, ""Songs For Women, Free Game for Ni**as."" ""Two years ago, he had a camp for Love Records and I had pulled up,"" she told CNN. ""It was so funny because he didn't like none of the songs I was writing."" Ironic, given that Jozzy was writing R&B songs in the style of the very music Diddy had helped popularize. Jozzy said she was about to leave the camp discouraged when the offer to meet Diddy was presented. They talked and she was invited - once again - to travel to Miami to work. The whole thing has been a dream for the woman born Jocelyn Donald, who as a teen spent her days growing up in Memphis, grinding in recording studios and writing. Her first stint in Miami came via a protege of uber producer Timbaland, and soon Jozzy was learning from him and Missy Elliott. Those early days didn't bring much money, Jozzy said, but she found a wealth of experience. ""Meeting Missy and meeting Timbaland and meeting [producer] Polow da Don, it was like artist development,"" she said. ""In 2015, I got my first [song] placement around the time I was with Polow."" Her songwriting roster is impressive. Her tunes have been performed by Fergie, Monica, Summer Walker, Internet Money and more. But it was the 2019 breakout hit ""Old Town Road Remix,"" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, that really helped solidify her career as a premiere songwriter. ""I was sick as a dog and I get a call from my manager like, 'You you wanna work with Billy Ray Cyrus?' And I was like, hell yeah,"" Jozzy said, laughing. ""It wasn't even Lil Nas at the time. They didn't even say Lil Nas. They just said Billy Ray and I was a Hannah Montana fan [the character played by his daughter, Miley Cyrus.]"" She wrote the country star's lyrics for ""Old Town Road Remix.""  Jozzy is hoping her songwriting success (she was part of groups nominated for two album of the year Grammys last year, one for Mary J. Blige's ""Good Morning Gorgeous (Deluxe)"" and the other for  Beyoncé's ""Renaissance"") will extend to her career as a singer. She is already off to a great start. At last year's Billboard Music Awards, Diddy introduced her as ""one of the most talented songwriters and artists I have ever worked with. She reminds me of the R&B Biggie."" Jozzy said she is beyond grateful to team up with Diddy. ""I'm not signed to him. We're doing a partnership,"" she said. ""It's 50/50 partnership at Love Records.""

                      Dominion Voting Systems can't bring up the January 6 insurrection during its upcoming defamation trial against Fox News, a Delaware judge ruled Tuesday, who also revealed at a hearing that he has been receiving death threats. The voting technology company sued Fox News over the right-wing network's promotions of false claims that Dominion machines rigged the 2020 election. But almost all of the allegedly defamatory statements mentioned in Dominion's lawsuit occurred before the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis said at a hearing Tuesday that invoking January 6 would be too prejudicial with the jury, and that the case isn't about whether Fox News ""influenced"" the insurrection.  ""That may be for another court at another time, but it's not for this court at this time,"" Davis said.  The judge issued rulings on nearly two dozen pretrial motions that will set the stage for the historic trial, which is set to kick off this week, with jury selection on Thursday. Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. Fox says it didn't defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Threats against the judge The judge also revealed Tuesday that he has received death threats.  ""I've sent you things that I've received,"" Davis told lawyers from both sides, during a discussion about separate death threats targeting Dominion employees.  The discussion revolved around whether Dominion can bring up the threats and harassment that its employees have faced after the 2020 election, which one Dominion lawyer said has instilled ""terror"" among its employees and has ""devastated"" the company's ability to recruit and retain staff.  Davis ruled that Dominion can tell the jury about the existence of the threats, but can't get into the content of the threats, because Fox obviously doesn't directly control what uninvolved third parties say.  ""I'm not downplaying it,"" Davis said to the Dominion lawyers. ""You need to take every threat seriously. I take every threat seriously."" Dominion has argued that many of the threats were inspired by Fox, which the network denies. If Dominion wins, it wants Fox to pay for the beefed-up security measures that it implemented after 2020.  A court spokesperson declined to comment about the threats against Davis. The judge did not disclose any details about the threats against him, or whether any of them were deemed credible. Flurry of pretrial rulings Davis ruled in Dominion's favor on other key questions, blocking Fox from making some First Amendment arguments and from bringing up evidence that it thought would help its defense.   The judge ruled that Fox can't bring up broadcasts where reporters accurately fact-checked Trump's lies about the 2020 election, to prove that other broadcasts that amplified those lies weren't defamatory.  Those other broadcasts ""are not relevant"" to the case, Davis said, because ""you can't absolve yourself of defamation by putting someone else on at a different time"" who told the truth about Dominion.   The judge also ruled that Fox can't use internal Dominion emails where its staffers said their products ""suck"" and were ""riddled with bugs,"" to prove that there were real concerns about Dominion machines. Those emails weren't public in 2020, so they couldn't have influenced the state of mind of Fox staffers when they promoted the Dominion claims on their shows.  But if Dominion wins and the case moves to damages, Fox can bring up these emails to show that Dominion might be losing business because of voting security concerns and not just because of alleged defamation.  Later in the hearing, Davis cleared the way for Dominion to bring up Fox's financial information at the trial, including details about salaries of top hosts and executives. Fox tried to block this from the trial, arguing that salaries aren't linked to ratings, and that this data could bias the jury against the network.  ""Economics are relevant,"" Davis said.   Judge scolds Fox for obfuscating Murdoch's role In an unexpected twist near the end of the daylong hearing, the judge scolded Fox's lawyers after Dominion revealed that network had serially obfuscated Rupert Murdoch's official role at the company. Murdoch is the chairman of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News. The network's lawyers have maintained for years that he had no official title at Fox News. But over the weekend, they conceded that he is also an officer at Fox News. This distinction -- albeit technical -- could have significant legal implications. Dominion claimed this blocked them from getting Murdoch-related documents in discovery. And by further tying Murdoch to Fox News, and not just to its parent company, Dominion may have more paths to prove actual malice. ""You have a credibility problem,"" Davis told Fox's lawyers, adding, ""I don't know if this is something that we have to turn the battleship around,"" with the trial looming, but ""I need to feel comfortable that when you represent something with me that it's the truth -- and that was not true."" A Fox lawyer pushed back by saying Murdoch's role at Fox News was just an ""honorific title"" and that he wasn't directly involved with any of the allegedly defamatory broadcasts after the 2020 election. ""I hope you're not being cagey with me,"" Davis continued. ""...I don't know why this is such a difficult thing... To say you don't know who your officers are, seems extremely bizarre to me."" As the hearing wrapped, Davis brought up the subject again, clearly frustrated by the revelation. ""I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at the situation I'm in,"" Davis told the Fox lawyers. ""...It was represented to me on multiple occasions that he's not an officer at Fox News."" In a statement late Tuesday night, a Fox spokesperson pushed back on Dominion's claims that it withheld information about Murdoch's role. ""Rupert Murdoch has been listed as executive chairman of Fox News in our SEC filings since 2019 and this filing was referenced by Dominion's own attorney during his deposition,"" the spokesperson said.

The former governor of California is well-versed in public works projects and on Tuesday he posted a video on social media showing him and his team filling in a hole on a street. ""Today, after the whole neighborhood has been upset about this giant pothole that's been screwing up cars and bicycles for weeks, I went out with my team and fixed it,"" Schwarzenegger tweeted from his legacy verified account. ""I always say, let's not complain, let's do something about it. Here you go."" In the video a driver stops to thank the star and he responds, ""This is crazy. For weeks I've been waiting for this hole to be closed."" Elena Stern, a senior public information director for the Department of Public Works in Los Angeles, told NBC News that it was not a pothole, but a ""service trench that relates to active, permitted work being performed at the location by SoCal Gas, who expects the work to be completed by the end of May.""

She candidly shared that she has gone through periods where she's struggled with her own health but said she ""shouldn't have to explain that."" She added that she did ultimately want to share this message with her followers because she hopes that perhaps some good can come from the conversation.  ""You never know what someone is going through.

                      Pedro Pascal and Sarah Paulson are two of Hollywood's most in-demand actors, often pictured at red carpet events together, but that hasn't always been the case during their three decades-long friendship. As young actors struggling to navigate the industry, Paulson would help her friend make ends meet. ""There were times when I would give him my per diem from a job I was working on so that he could have money to feed himself,"" she told Esquire magazine in an interview published Tuesday.  The pair first met when Pascal was studying at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts in 1993 and befriended a group of recent LaGuardia High graduates, a group that included Paulson. ""We would go to see movies all the time in those years, and we would get so lost in them,"" Paulson told Esquire. ""You can fill in the blanks about the why of that however you like, but I think there were things we wanted to escape mentally, emotionally, spiritually."" Their friendship has endured, with glimpses of it appearing on their respective Instagram pages and during red carpet events, such as the 2016 SAG Awards. Paulson even featured in Pascal's SNL debut two months ago, appearing in a sketch that poked fun at their internet personas of ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy."" Hosting SNL was the latest confirmation that Pascal's career has exploded into the stratosphere.  The 48-year-old is currently fronting two blockbuster TV series -- playing Joel in HBO's ""The Last of Us"" and the title character on Disney+'s ""The Mandalorian."" He will star in Pedro Almodóvar's new film ""Strange Way of Life"" alongside Ethan Hawke later this year. But, after graduating NYU in 1997, Pascal struggled to definitively break into the industry. He appeared in an episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and three episodes of ""Undressed,"" waited tables at several New York restaurants, and auditioned for commercials and films.  ""I died so many deaths,"" Pascal recalled. ""My vision of it was that if I didn't have some major exposure by the time I was 29 years old, it was over, so I was constantly readjusting what it meant to commit my life to this profession, and giving up the idea of it looking like I thought it would when I was a kid. There were so many good reasons to let that delusion go."" Pascal's unconventional career trajectory and surrogate father role in ""The Last of Us"" have earned him the internet's adoration, and the sexually-charged title of ""Daddy"" -- the hashtag ""PedroPascalDaddy,"" has more than 8.2 billion views on TikTok alone. ""He's a part of some spectacularly successful things,"" Paulson added. ""But sometimes in those situations, the show is the superstar. It's really exciting to see that he is the thing that is becoming the superstar out of this.""

                      Tucker Carlson plays a straight-shooter on television. From his prime time perch on Fox News, Carlson portrays himself to his loyal audience of millions as a truth-teller, someone who tells it like it is and calls out BS from whoever peddles it. But it is all an act, as evidenced by his weak excuse for an interview with former President Donald Trump that aired on Tuesday night, Trump's first since being indicted on dozens of felony counts of business fraud. Carlson sat silent as Trump rambled and ranted his way through the sit-down, making a number of eyebrow-raising comments on a host of topics that were never challenged by the right-wing talk host. Carlson made no effort to press the disgraced president on any of the issues that an actual news anchor would. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Instead, Carlson sang Trump's praises. ""For a man caricatured as an extremist, we think you'll find what he has to say moderate, sensible, and wise,"" Carlson told his audience. At another point in his program, Carlson mocked the ""Neo-con media establishment"" for suggesting Trump is a ""dangerous lunatic."" It was all quite a sight to see coming from a man who has been exposed to hold Trump in great disdain, as evidenced by private messages he sent which have come to light as part of Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News. Carlson actually ""hate[s]"" Trump. And he hates him ""passionately."" He believes Trump is a ""destroyer."" A ""demonic force."" A president who was a ""disaster."" A politician whose behavior after losing the 2020 election was ""disgusting."" Carlson just doesn't have the courage to say any of it on television — or apparently to the man whom he privately made such comments about. Carlson's refusal to disclose to his viewers his true opinions of Trump reflect the grip the former president still exerts over the Republican Party. Even Carlson, the most popular MAGA Media figure whom most of the GOP fears, thinks it is necessary to kiss the ring of Trump. It's a broader phenomenon reflected across Fox News, as also revealed by private messages uncovered in Dominion's lawsuit. Even GOP kingmaker Rupert Murdoch appeared to fear Trump's wrath. And it speaks to what could happen in 2024 and beyond. Right-wing media stars like Carlson might want to move past Trump. Carlson, himself, confided in a producer after the 2020 election, ""We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait."" But the reality is it will be quite difficult to ignore him now that he is once again in the race for the White House and facing criminal charges. On Tuesday night, as Carlson bowed before Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he demonstrated exactly that.

                      Matthew McConaughey sounds ready to dive into a new role. Days after Paramount Media Networks head Chris McCarthy confirmed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that McConaughey is set to star in a ""Yellowstone"" spinoff, a podcast conversation offered some insight into  McConaughey's current thinking about his career. Dax Shepard spoke with the Oscar-winning actor on a new ""Armchair Expert"" episode, and McConaughey said he's in a different place in his life after spending time writing a memoir in recent years. ""I am now becoming more interested in actually going to play another character in a TV show because the last four years of culminating and writing and getting these things together and getting more into public service,"" McConaughey explained. ""The idea of going to act in the right kind of role, in the right kind of movie, film or series right now sounds like an awesome vacation.""  The ""Dallas Buyers Club"" star said his choice to step back from performing to focus on other projects has not ""been in vain,"" adding ""I'll be a different or improved actor in my own right after this last three years."" ""What I have is so much respect for the vocation of acting,"" McConaughey said. ""I think I have a healthier relationship. I'm not looking at it for my survival and my thrive-all. I think good acting emulates life. Real life is where this stuff comes from."" McConaughey was thrust back into the spotlight after a report in February that Kevin Costner would be leaving ""Yellowstone,"" with McConaughey potentially joining the franchise. ""We have no news to report,"" a spokesperson for Paramount told CNN in a statement at the time. McCarthy told THR in his recent interview that there are plans to move ahead with the spinoff starring McConaughey regardless of how Costner's role evolves on ""Yellowstone.""

                      The Writers Guild of America is set to hold a strike authorization vote on Tuesday. If it passes, which it is expected to, that will allow leadership to call a strike if the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers do not reach a new contract agreement by May 1.  ""The studios need to respond to the crisis writers face,"" WGA leadership said in a message to members ahead of the vote. ""WGA members must demonstrate our willingness to fight for the contract writers need and deserve by supporting a strike authorization vote."" The two sides have met a few times since negotiations began March 20. The WGA is calling for additional compensation and residuals from features in theaters or on streaming platforms, an end to the abuse of ""mini-rooms"" (smaller number of writers in the room) and increasing contributions to pension and health funds.   Voting opens Tuesday at 8:30 pm local time on both the the west and east coasts and closes on Monday, April 17, at 12 pm local time, with vote results to follow.  ""Studios have been getting away with murder and they know it. I think that the money is still there,"" said Ashley Lyle, WGA member and a writer on the Showtime show Yellowjackets, in a video message to members.  But the AMPTP, which represents studios and streamers, said the entertainment industry has changed in recent years and writers need to make concessions. ""The AMPTP companies approach this negotiation and the ones to follow with the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority,"" AMPTP said shortly before negotiations began. ""We are all partners in charting the future of our business together and fully committed to reaching a mutually beneficial deal with each of our bargaining partners. The goal is to keep production active so that all of us can continue working and continue to deliver to consumers the best entertainment product available in the world.""  AMPTP represents Amazon, Apple, CBS, Disney, NBCU, Netflix, Paramount Global, Sony, and CNN's parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.  WGA said its writers are unfairly compensated as streaming popularity — and its share of Hollywood's revenue — grows. ""The business has transitioned to a streaming-first model, with the legacy film and television markets representing a declining share of total revenue,"" WGA wrote in the report.  The survival of the writers' profession is at stake, as companies ""slashed compensation,"" WGA said in the message to members. The media industry is struggling as advertising revenue has evaporated over the past year, and companies have announced mass layoffs. The WGA announced a two-week break in negotiations starting April 1. But, according to an industry insider close to the negotiations, WGA and AMPTP met last Wednesday for the most engaging session yet. Neither side has made any counter offers to the opening proposals, the person with knowledge of the matter said. Negotiations are slated to pick up again the week of April 17.  The last writers' strike was in 2007 and lasted 100 days, bringing Hollywood production to a screeching halt.   ""Three weeks is plenty of time to hammer out a deal, negotiations in 2017 went right down to the wire,"" the industry insider says of the looming May 1 deadline.  The WGA-AMPTP negotiation is the first of three contract negotiations with entertainment unions. The Directors Guild of America will start negotiations on May 10 ahead of their contract expiration on June 30. The Screen Actors Guild contract also expires June 30.

                      Australian broadcaster Sky News has left TikTok because of security concerns that have led several Western governments to ban the video app on devices used by officials. In an article published on the Sky News Australia website Monday, digital editor Jack Houghton said the security risks posed by the ""Beijing-controlled platform"" were ""too great for any serious news publisher."" ""TikTok is a spy network masquerading as a social media platform which has been proven to illegally pilfer the data of journalists, public citizens and politicians,"" Houghton wrote.  ""We urge [media organizations] to consider this dilemma and stop trading security and integrity for a few worthless views,"" he added. In a statement to CNN, Lee Hunter, General Manager of Operations for TikTok in Australia and New Zealand, said he respects the broadcaster's right to make decisions to best serve its audience, but rejected the ""allegations and insinuations"" made in the Sky News Australia article. ""[They] are completely false and we reject them in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. Experts say the security fears behind the recent government bans, while serious, currently appear to reflect only the potential for TikTok to be used for foreign intelligence, not that it has been. There is still no public evidence the Chinese government has actually spied on people through TikTok. Sky News Australia is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and is a separate entity to UK broadcaster Sky News, which is owned by Sky Group, a division of US conglomerate Comcast.  Last year, TikTok's owner ByteDance admitted that four employees had improperly accessed personal data of two journalists from the Financial Times and BuzzFeed. ByteDance said the relevant staff were investigating potential information leaks, and they were fired for misusing their authority to access TikTok user data. Separately, broader concerns have been raised by experts worldwide that TikTok presents a security risk due to the vast troves of data it collects on millions of users, and its vulnerability to potential interference from the Chinese government, which wields considerable influence over businesses in its jurisdiction. Government bans The United States and other Western nations have banned the app on government devices, with the Biden administration threatening to go further by imposing a broader ban unless TikTok's Chinese owners sell their stakes in the company. A blanket ban would deny 150 million US users access to the platform.  TikTok has repeatedly denied it has links to Beijing, and the company's CEO Shou Chew recently told a US congressional hearing that he'd seen no evidence that the Chinese government had access to user data and had never asked for it. Moreover, he said the amount of information the company collects on users is no more than most industry players. While a number of governments have moved to delete TikTok from their employees' phones, most major news companies are yet to follow. Last month, the BBC advised staff to delete TikTok from their work phones, following a similar move by Danish public broadcaster, DR, but the British broadcaster still publishes its content on the short form video app to millions of followers.  Sky News Australia's Houghton said the decision by the BBC to ban the app yet publish content on the platform was a ""paradox"" that ""proves the hunger for reaching new demographics has perverted editorial strategies in newsrooms globally."" CNN has reached out to the BBC for comment. Before it deleted its account, Houghton said Sky News Australia had 65,000 followers and ""many millions of video views."" The channel is known for its conservative commentary and last year was described in a report by UK think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue as ""an important right-wing outlet with growing influence internationally.""  In relation to the climate crisis, it was also described as ""content hub for influencers, sceptics and outlets across the globe.""  In 2021, YouTube banned Sky News Australia from uploading new content for one week for posting misinformation about the Covid pandemic.  At the time, the broadcaster issued a statement rejecting allegations that its host had denied the existence of Covid-19, and that it had published or removed videos that showed them saying as much. Houghton also argued in an online article that the decision was ""a disturbing attack on the ability to think freely.""

According to People, Swift made the change late last month during her concert at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Both songs appear on her Grammy winning ""Folklore"" album. Alwyn contributed to the project using the pseudonym ""William Bowery."" The lyrics to ""Invisible String"" reference finding love after heartache. ""Time, mystical time/Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine/Were there clues I didn't see?"" the lyrics read. ""Isn't it just so pretty to think/All along there was some/Invisible string/Tying you to me?"" ""The 1"" is a song about a love that didn't work out. ""But we were something, don't you think so?/Roaring 20s, tossing pennies in the pool/And if my wishes came true/It would've been you,"" Swift sings. ""In my defense, I have none/For never leaving well enough alone/But it would've been fun/If you would've been the one."" CNN has reached out to a representative of Swift for comment.

                      Fox News has settled a defamation lawsuit from a Venezuelan businessman who had accused the network of making false claims about him and the 2020 election, attorneys for the man and Fox News said Saturday in a court filing. The details of the settlement were not made public. ""This matter has been resolved amicably by both sides,"" a Fox News spokesperson said Sunday, declining further comment.  Following the 2020 election, former Fox Business host Lou Dobbs had accused the businessman, Majed Khalil, of playing a key role in supposedly rigging the election against Donald Trump. In a tweet calling the 2020 election a ""cyber Pearl Harbor,"" Dobbs named Khalil as one of four people he wanted his audience to ""get familiar with"" for committing supposed election fraud. Fox News still faces a monster $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems, which is set to go to trial in just days. Jury selection for the trial begins Thursday and opening statements are scheduled for April 17, unless the two sides reach a settlement before then. Dominion had sued Fox News for defamation, and says it was defamed by the right-wing network when Fox hosts and guests claimed in 2020 that its voting systems illegally rigged the election against Trump. Fox News has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, maintained it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, and argued that Dominion's lawsuit represents a threat to the First Amendment. While Fox's legal liability will be decided at trial, the case has already battered Fox's reputation. Incriminating texts and emails have shown how Fox executives, hosts and producers didn't believe the claims the network was peddling about Dominion.  The lawsuit is seen as one of the most consequential defamation cases in recent memory.  Fox has argued that a loss will eviscerate press freedoms, and many scholars agree that the bar should remain high to prove defamation.  Other analysts have said holding Fox accountable for knowingly airing lies won't pose a threat to objective journalists who would never do that in the first place.

Born in 1952, Wellander did his first session with Swedish pop legends ABBA in October 1974, when songs ""Intermezzo No.1"" and ""Crazy World"" were recorded. Soon after, he became the main guitarist on the group's albums, and toured with them in 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1980, according to the band's website. Even after Anni-Frid ""Frida"" Lyngstad, Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog went their separate ways in 1982, Wellander stayed in the fold, working with Benny and Björn.  He appeared on a number of albums, including the ""Chess"" concept album, two ""Gemini"" albums and the soundtracks for the films ""Mamma Mia"" and ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" as well as the ABBA album ""Voyage,"" released in November 2021. Wellander played with several groups during the 80s, including Low Budget Blues Band, Zkiffz, Little Mike and the Sweet Soul Music Band and Stockholm All Stars, according to the biography on his official website. A celebrated musician in his own right, Wellander released seven studio albums, two of which made the Top 40 album charts, according to his biography on ABBA's website. He received the Albin Hagström Memorial Award from The Royal Swedish Academy of Music in 2005 and 13 years later was awarded the Swedish Musicians Union's prestigious special prize Studioräven Award for his work as a session musician.

                      'Succession' delivers a major surprise as the show goes back to its future

                      In one astonishing turn, ""Succession"" took its audience back to where the show began five years ago, and indeed, the very roots of its title. The Emmy-winning HBO show kicked off, after all, with a media empire being thrown into chaos when its imperious leader fell ill, leaving his children and underlings to jockey over how to replace him, and to contemplate if anyone possibly could. The very title dealt with that scenario, while the intervening seasons have reinforced the sense that in terms of corporate savvy and grit, the apples can fall pretty far from the tree. The power of Brian Cox's performance as that mogul, Logan Roy, made him seem practically immortal, the occasional infirmities of his age notwithstanding. But in one off-screen moment, Logan was gone, in the most protracted and painful fashion imaginable, leaving his stunned offspring to weakly try to say goodbye over the phone, and then grapple along with his subordinates with the implications of what his death would mean. Series creator Jesse Armstrong didn't grant Logan much dignity in death, as he collapsed in the bathroom aboard a private jet on a mission to salvage his big-money merger with GoJo. In hindsight, he also telegraphed the character's fate in the opening hour, as Logan mused about the prospect of an afterlife, concluding that while nobody can know, this is probably all that there is. Logan certainly lived his life that way, and his demise was preceded by a scene that underscored his ruthlessness and cruelty, tasking his son Roman (Kieran Culkin) with firing longtime employee Gerri (J. Smith Cameron), despite the elder Roy's knowledge that the two had an unusually close (if somewhat unorthodox) relationship.  The kids, meanwhile, went through a series of reactions, both emotional and pragmatic. Not everyone, after all, has to worry about how their father's death is going to influence the financial markets and potentially tank their company's stock price, costing them millions of dollars as collateral damage. As an added bonus, the younger Roys had broken with their father, competing against him for the acquisition of Pierce Global Media, adding to the intense discomfort and obvious mixed feelings as those scenes played out. ""We're not estranged,"" Kendall (Jeremy Strong) insisted, despite evidence to the contrary, while his sister Shiv (Sarah Snook) practically pleaded to her unconscious dad over the phone, ""Don't go, please, not now."" The one note of semi-normalcy within the hour came from an unlikely source: Elder brother Connor (Alan Ruck) and his bride-to-be Willa (Justin Lupe), who decided to go through with their wedding, a surprisingly human choice given his plans to use the occasion as a tool to prop up his polling-under-one-percent presidential campaign. The other Roy children, meanwhile, seemed to derive a degree of strength from each other, with Kendall and Roman seeking to reassure themselves by saying, sardonically, ""You're not gonna be OK."" ""Succession"" has confounded expectations by throwing in this twist so early in the final season, but in hindsight, this was always where things were logically heading, with what amounts to a royal succession and what happens after the king dies without a clear heir. Cox will surely be missed over the remaining hours (barring flashbacks of some kind). Yet in terms of setting up dramatic (and comedic) possibilities around the deal-making, scheming and family dynamics to come, the show is coming back to where it all started, in a way that appears destined to be more than OK.

                      Michael Lerner, a veteran character actor who received an Oscar nomination for his performance as an overbearing studio head in the 1991 film ""Barton Fink,"" has died, his nephew, actor Sam Lerner, announced in a post on social media. He was 81. ""We lost a legend last night,"" Sam Lerner wrote on Instagram Sunday. ""It's hard to put into words how brilliant my uncle Michael was, and how influential he was to me. His stories always inspired me and made me fall in love with acting. He was the coolest, most confident, talented guy, and the fact that he was my blood will always make me feel special. Everyone that knows him knows how insane he was— in the best way. I'm so lucky I got to spend so much time with him, and we're all lucky we can continue to watch his work for the rest of time. RIP Michael, enjoy your unlimited Cuban cigars, comfy chairs, and endless movie marathon."" No further details on Lerner's death were given. CNN has reached out to representatives for Michael and Sam Lerner for further comment. Michael Lerner was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1941 and studied drama at Brooklyn College. He later earned a Fulbright scholarship and spent two years in London before he was invited to join the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. He was discovered by an agent in San Francisco who brought him down to Los Angeles where his Hollywood career began.  With film and television credits dating back to the 1960's, Lerner's career in Hollywood spanned decades. His earliest work throughout the '60's and '70's included appearances on television shows like ""The Doris Day Show,"" ""The Bob Newhart Show"" and ""M*A*S*H.""  His first film came in 1970 as the character Leo in ""Alex in Wonderland"" alongside Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn. Lerner went on to appear in films such as ""The Ski Bum,"" ""The Candidate,"" and ""Outlaw Blues.""  The actor appeared in multiple episodes of ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""Melba"" in the mid '80s before he starred in ""Barton Fink"" in 1991. His performance as studio executive Jack Lipnick, for which he starred alongside John Turturro, John Goodman and Judy Davis, earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.  ""I read the script, and you just know good writing. It was brilliantly written, and I just knew it,"" Lerner said in 2016 of the ""Barton Fink"" script, adding that during his audition in front of directors Joel and Ethan Coen, ""I did the monologue the way I wanted to do it and I just walked of the room and that was it. And Joel and Ethan were just sitting in a corner just laughing and laughing and that was it."" In 1995, Lerner starred in the CBS drama ""Courthouse"" as Judge Myron Winkleman, which lasted for one season. He went on to play Cher Horowitz's dad Mel Horowitz for one season in the 1996 ""Clueless"" television series inspired by the hugely successful film of the same name starring Alicia Silverstone.  Throughout the aughts and 2010's, Lerner appeared as Fulton in the holiday classic ""Elf"" alongside Will Farrell, and in TV shows like ""Law and Order: SVU,"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""Glee.""

                      ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" powered up at the box office with an impressive opening.  The movie ran up the score with more than $200 million in the US and Canada for its five-day opening run, according to a news release, and an estimated $377 million worldwide -- the latter topping the box office launch record for an animated movie, previously held by ""Frozen 2."" It marks the biggest global box office opening of the year, with ""Super Mario Bros."" standing ahead of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" which brought in the $225.3 million during its February opening. The movie is based on the world of Nintendo's classic 1985 ""Super Mario"" video games and stars Chris Pratt as Mario, Charlie Day as Luigi and Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach. Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, Kevin Michael Richardson and Sebastian Maniscalco round out the cast. Actor Charles Martinet, Mario's longtime official voice in the games -- who many gamer purists felt should have been cast as the titular character instead of Pratt -- makes a special appearance in the movie. ""Super Mario Bros."" follows Brooklyn plumbers Mario and Luigi as they're transported down a mysterious pipe while working underground to fix a water main. The brothers wander into a ""magical new world"" and when they're separated, ""Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi,"" according to a synopsis on the movie's website.  The solid opening is a healthy sign for movie theaters headed into the summer box office season, with the next ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie, also starring Pratt, kicking off in May.

                      Taylor Swift and actor Joe Alwyn have broken up after six years together. A source close to Taylor confirmed the news to CNN saying ""Taylor and Joe broke up a few weeks ago. They simply grew apart and plan to remain friends."" CNN has reached out to Swift and Alwyn's reps for comment. Entertainment Tonight was first to report the news. Swift, who is currently on her ""Eras Tour,"" and Alwyn were first linked romantically in 2016. The Grammy-winner and Alwyn managed to keep their relationship mostly under wraps, but in true Taylor Swift style, the singer dropped some Easter eggs about Alwyn through her music along the way. In January, Swift revealed on her Instagram that ""Lavender Haze,"" a track from her 2022 album ""Midnights,"" is about Alwyn, saying when you're in a lavender haze of love, ""you'll do anything to stay there and not let people bring you down off of that cloud."" ""Like my relationship for six years, we've had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff and we just ignore it. This song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff,"" she added. Alwyn also earned a writing credit on ""Midnights"" for the song ""Sweet Nothing."" It's not the first time the couple have collaborated on songs that have appeared on Swift's albums. The British actor was credited on a number of songs from Swift's 2020 pandemic-era albums ""folklore"" and ""evermore"" under the pseudonym ""William Bowery."" Swift confirmed the true identity on the Disney+ documentary ""folklore: the long pond studio sessions"" that same year, where she said Alwyn ""plays piano beautifully and he's always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things."" ""Folklore"" ended up winning a Grammy for album of the year in 2021, marking Alwyn's first Grammy win. There was also speculation in 2019 the then-couple were engaged when Swifties picked up on some bridal-leaning lyrics in ""Lover,"" the title track off the album she released that year. ""If I had a pound for every time I think I've been told I've been engaged, then I'd have a lot of pound coins,"" Alwyn told WSJ Magazine in 2022, coyly adding ""I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn't say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn't say.""

                      Molly Shannon hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" on April 8 and reprised her iconic character, 50-year-old woman Sally O'Malley. The character returned in a sketch featuring the episode's musical guest, the Jonas Brothers, with Nick, Joe and Kevin Jonas all appearing on stage to introduce Sally O'Malley as the band's new choreographer. Kenan Thompson played the Jonas Brothers' manager and broke the news to Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman, who played choreographers Gretel and Turbo, that the band is looking for a new, more ""mature"" concept. ""My name is Sally O'Malley. I'm proud to say I'm 50 years old. I'm not one of those girls who's afraid to tell her real age,"" Shannon said, before going into her iconic ""and I like to kick, stretch and kick"" routine. Donning her classic red and white two-piece costume, Shannon continued the routine to recite the character's tagline: ""I'm 50! 50 years old."" Thompson, Yang and Fineman were then visibly seen breaking character to laugh while Shannon hiked up the waistline of her red pants, as Sally O'Malley did when she appeared on ""SNL"" in the past. ""Honey, I've been 50 since before you was born,"" Shannon said when Yang's Turbo questioned her age. The beloved character first debuted in a 1999 sketch where Sally O'Malley attends an open audition for the Rockettes with then-host Danny DeVito. Sally O'Malley was 50 years old then, too. When Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas and Kevin Jonas walked on stage, Nick Jonas said they had a feeling Turbo and Gretel may not understand their new concept. ""So we wanted to show them,"" Joe Jonas said as the three brothers ripped their clothes off to showcase outfits matching Sally O'Malley's. The four of them performed a kick-and-stretch dance routine, but when Nick Jonas flubs a move, he's kicked out of the band and replaced by Sally O'Malley. A graphic of the front page of a newspaper appears on the screen with the headline text reading ""new Jonas Brother is 50-year-old woman!"" Shannon was an ""SNL"" cast member from 1995 to 2001 and is known for her recurring characters like Sally O'Malley and Mary Katherine Gallagher. Saturday's episode was the ""White Lotus"" star's second time hosting the famed sketch show, with the Jonas Brothers returning as the musical guest for the third time.

                      The BBC is seeking a swift resolution after Twitter branded it as ""government funded media."" Britain's national broadcaster is predominantly funded by UK households via a license fee, which is also required to watch non-BBC channels or live services. This is supplemented by income from commercial operations.  The @BBC account -- which has 2.2 million followers -- is currently branded as government funded. The label has not been given to the BBC's other accounts, including BBC News (World) and BBC Breaking News.  Twitter has not given a definition for what it considers ""government funded media"" to constitute.  In a statement provided to CNN, the BBC said: ""We are speaking to Twitter to resolve this issue as soon as possible.  ""The BBC is, and always has been, independent. We are funded by the British public through the licence fee."" The BBC received the label after a similar one was given to America's National Public Radio (NPR).  Twitter initially designated the US broadcaster as ""state-affiliated media,"" putting it on a par with Russian propaganda network RT and China's Xinhua News Agency.  Following backlash from NPR -- who said it would not tweet from the account while the label was in place -- it was instead changed to ""government funded media.""  NPR receives some funding from public institutions but the vast majority comes from sources such as corporate sponsorships and NPR membership fees. Twitter defines state-affiliated media outlets as outlets ""where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution.""

                      To quote one profiler's words back in 1992, he was ""the hunky heir."" Brandon Lee's athleticism made him a natural fit for the martial arts-forward roles that got his foot in Hollywood's door and the perfect person to take up the mantle left by his legendary father Bruce Lee's death.  But there are a lot of Brandon Lees the world didn't get to meet before an accident on the set of his movie ""The Crow"" took his life a little more than 30 years ago.  There was the Brandon who physically dispatched a burglar whom he caught in his own home and held down until police arrived to apprehend the crook.   The Brandon who, as the president of his high school senior class, staged a rebellion of sorts during which he urged his classmates not to take school seriously. He was expelled.  The Brandon who had his eye on a pretty girl he met while taking a meeting at a production company, charmed her with his faux arrogance and later shared a first kiss at the company Christmas party. He would go on to ask for her hand in marriage.  ""Brandon's personality led him to being a 'character' in everything he did,"" his mother, Linda Lee Cadwell, told CNN.   Brandon Bruce Lee was a brother, son, fiancé, friend, hopeless romantic, literary savant, lover of animals, avid reader, prolific storyteller and talented actor on his way to becoming a bona fide movie star. Then he was accidentally shot and killed by a jammed prop gun in March 1993. He was only 28.  He's now been gone longer than he was alive. But those who knew him -- the whole, complicated him and the man he eagerly wanted moviegoers to become better acquainted with through his work -- know their memories of Brandon are as formidable as he was. Like his father, his loved ones say, he was too big of a mind and spirit to be contained in something as fleeting as time.  ""My brother's fearlessness and his sense of adventure and freedom, his inherent artistry and creativity, and his desire for learning and growth all came from the time that he spent with my father,"" Shannon Lee told CNN in an interview. ""My father was my brother's hero."" A father's influence Bruce Lee delighted in sharing martial arts with his son, Cadwell remembers, sharing her memories in a statement to CNN.  Brandon spoke often about his father's training in his early interviews, proud that he'd gotten years of study under him and at the same time, deeply saddened that it was cut short.  Brandon was just eight years old when his father died from cerebral edema in 1973, mere months after the release of ""Enter the Dragon"" turned him into a global icon. He was 32.  His mother described Brandon as ""terribly hurt"" when Bruce Lee died, and it took some time for Brandon to pick the art back up.  After spending parts of his childhood in Hong Kong, where many of his father's movies were filmed, Brandon fluently spoke Cantonese and had to readjust to speaking English when Cadwell relocated the family to Seattle following Bruce Lee's death. After a year in the Pacific Northwest, the Lees settled in Los Angeles, hoping for a fresh start.  When he was a teenager, with the help of Danny Inosanto, Bruce Lee's protégé, Brandon began training again, eventually becoming proficient in his father's style, Jeet Kune Do (""the way of the intercepting fist"").  Soon, Brandon was back on track to pursue his lifelong dream of acting. ""I've always wanted to be an actor,"" Brandon said in an interview with the Ottawa Citizen in 1992. ""I never wanted to do anything else even when I was in elementary school."" Brandon's first acting credit came in 1986 when he starred in ""Kung Fu: The Movie."" He went on to star in ""Legacy of Rage,"" a traditional Hong Kong-style action film, and later starred alongside Ernest Borgnine in the action film ""Laser Mission"" in 1989.  In the early '90s, Brandon starred in action movies ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"" and ""Rapid Fire."" He often drew comparisons to action stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean Claude Van Damme, and, most frequently, his father.  Cadwell said she had many conversations with Brandon about the expectations put upon him as Bruce Lee's son. But Brandon's goal, she said, was always to ""be his own man.""  ""Brandon was so much like his father in that he thought long and deeply about his passions,"" Cadwell said.  Bruce Lee used to say that he was a martial artist first and an actor second, Cadwell remembers. Brandon would say the opposite. ""I firmly believe that my father would not have wanted his life to be a problem to me,"" Brandon also told the Ottawa Citizen in 1992. ""If I had a son, I would want to be a benefit, not a burden.""  Being a father himself is something Brandon was looking forward to experiencing with his fiancée Eliza Hutton, his sister said.  Hutton, the aforementioned production company employee who he became smitten with and took to a Melissa Etheridge concert on one of their first dates, says ""there were so many things to love about him.""  ""He was genuine, charming, highly intelligent, insightful, moral, fearless, romantic, and hilarious—all wrapped up in drop-dead gorgeousness,"" Hutton told CNN in an email exchange.  After an ""unforgettable"" proposal in Venice, Italy, Hutton and Brandon were set to marry just weeks after he was supposed to have completed filming ""The Crow.""  ""Brandon was a gifted and dedicated writer, actor and athlete with a sensitive soul who was wrongly taken from us too soon,"" Hutton said. ""No matter how deep the pain I've endured in losing him, I wouldn't trade our time together.""  Her memories of their time together read like pages ripped from a romance novel. These days, she says, ""I am reminded of Brandon in all things true, beautiful and strong.""  A rising star ""The Crow"" was set to be Brandon's doorway to bigger opportunities.  A noir supernatural thriller based on James O'Barr's graphic novel of the same name, Brandon played Eric Draven, a rock and roll guitarist who is summoned by a mysterious crow to rise from the dead and seek justice for murdering Draven and his fiancée Shelly (Sofia Shinas) on the eve of their Halloween wedding. The Alex Proyas-directed film had an estimated $23 million budget and was produced by Miramax. O'Barr, along with David J. Schow and John Shirley, wrote the script.  After the film, Brandon was ready and willing to work for opportunities that would allow him to stretch other muscles -- especially ones that didn't necessarily show off his physical skills.   It's not hard for Shannon Lee to imagine her brother starring in movies of today like ""The Matrix"" or ""Gladiator,"" but she also said he had the range to handle a major dramatic role akin to Adam Driver's performance in the 2019 romantic drama ""Marriage Story.""  ""He would have loved the opportunity to stretch and do dramatic roles,"" Shannon Lee said. He even auditioned for ""Say Anything,"" the 1989 rom-com starring John Cusack. It was a role he really wanted.  He quickly learned that as a matter of pragmatism, Shannon Lee said, he had to use his martial arts skills and his name to get his foot in the door -- or, rather, to kick the door down.  The tides turned when ""Rapid Fire"" came out in 1992. Shannon Lee was her brother's assistant on the movie and remembers him finally starting to feel hopeful that he was on his way to stepping outside of his father's shadow. By many accounts, ""The Crow"" was a film that Brandon was immensely excited about, and he was having the time of his life.  Jeff Most, a co-producer of the movie, told CNN in an interview that Brandon's ""brilliant"" notes about the script added to the film's emotional depth amid the physical brutality.  ""We really tailored the role and much of the world to Brandon's vision,"" he said.  He added: ""Obviously this role of Eric Draven showed the world how great an actor, truly great of an actor he was and what he would have gone on to do. I think the fact that we have this from him is just a blessing and it's a gift."" It was not uncommon for the bookish Brandon -- a walking dictionary, according to Shannon Lee -- to call upon his vast literary knowledge to inform his decisions on screen. In an interview in support of ""The Crow,"" he described his character by quoting a line from Paul Bowles 1949 novel ""The Sheltering Sky.""  ""Because we do not know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well,"" he quoted.  This, he said ""is the point of view that this character is coming from in the whole film, because it has been brought sharply into focus for him how precious each moment of his life is."" The movie was filming when he turned 28, and when Shannon Lee called to wish her brother a happy birthday, he told her that he was having an ""amazing"" day because he was ""doing the thing that I love most in the world.""  A tragic end The night before Brandon died, he called his mother.  ""He was so happy that that night would be the last of the scenes that involved weapons,"" Cadwell said. ""He was so looking forward to his next project, which was to be a film that did not include any martial arts. I felt so happy for him that he had reached his goal of being signed as a serious dramatic actor.""  While filming the final scenes of ""The Crow,"" Brandon was accidentally shot and killed when actor Michael Massee, who played drug dealer Funboy in the film, fired at Lee during a scene with a prop gun that was later found to have been improperly loaded.  Hit in the abdomen, Brandon died hours later in a nearby North Carolina hospital. Massee died in 2016. In their hearts, the Lee family and Hutton knew that Brandon would've wanted the movie to be completed and released, Shannon Lee recalls, knowing how proud he was of his work and his excitement for the opportunity. Looking back, she says ""it would have seemed really unfair for him not to get to share that with the world."" Brandon's remaining scenes were filmed using his stunt double, Chad Stahelski, who went on to direct the ""John Wick"" movies. When the film was eventually released in 1994, it went on to gross over $50 million worldwide at the box office.  Most said that he has been committed to not using practical firearms on his sets since Brandon died in 1993.  On-set accidents before and since Brandon's have brought forth renewed calls for tighter safety measures to be taken on TV and movie sets.  The call for action happened again in the wake of the death of Halyna Hutchins, the cinematographer who was accidentally shot and killed by a prop gun held by actor Alec Baldwin on the ""Rust"" film set.  Shannon Lee, speaking, she says, as somebody who has been ""spiritually, mortally and soulfully wounded by these sets of circumstances,"" commented that 30 years later, she doesn't see why practical firearms are used on sets at all these days when special effects are safer and can be more cost effective.  ""There is no reason to harm another human life, one human life should be enough,"" sh

                      Shania Twain wants more diversity in country music. Here's who she's talking about

                      ""Diversity"" is not a dirty word. One of the greatest things about this world -- or, at least, it should be -- is that we are not all the same. That's something Shania Twain, a queen in country music, clearly appreciates when she recently called on the genre to expand and feature new voices. Luckily, that's just what is happening. Something to sip on... During her recent acceptance speech for the Equal Play Award at the 2023 CMT Music Awards, Twain issued a call for more equity and diversity in the country music industry. She even showed them how it's done. Twain presented an award with The BoykinZ, a quartet of Black singing sisters who broke through on TikTok belting out country music. The artists recently crossed paths on ""The Kelly Clarkson Show.""  ""I invited them to do a little acappella piece with me tonight, just as part of my exchange of supporting upcoming young female artists, people that might, in this day and age, be excluded,"" Twain told People about the group on the CMT Awards red carpet.  When she heads out on her global arena tour later this month, Twain will be joined by a varied group of performers, including singers Breland and Mickey Guyton, the latter who has become one of the most high-profile Black singers in country music and one of the talent scouts on a new Apple TV+ music competition show, ""My Kind of Country."" And inclusiveness isn't just black and white. T.J. Osborne, one half of the Grammy-winning duo Brothers Osborne with his brother John, shared publicly in 2021 that he is gay. The LGBTQ representation in country music has increased with artists like Orville Peck, Lil Nas X and Brandi Carlile, all who are walking the trail blazed by artists like Chely Wright and the group Lavender Country.  It's great to see space being made and held for diverse artists in country music. One thing to talk about... I recently interviewed Teyana Taylor about her powerful performance in the new film ""A Thousand and One,"" which won the prestigious grand jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. But there's another role she has coming up that also has me super excited as Dionne Warwick in a forthcoming biopic. Anyone who watched the CNN documentary about Warwick knows how incredible she is as a performer and a person. Having met Taylor, I can tell you that she not only physically resembles Warwick, but she is also dynamic like the legendary performer and, of course, she can sing. ""We're very close. I talk to her and her son often,"" Taylor told me. ""It's really exciting. That was another dream of mine, to be able to sit next to the person that I get to play and just love on them."" In my interview with Warwick last year, she spoke highly of Taylor, and I am saying a little prayer this project debuts soon. You should listen to... This week's newsletter is heavy with people I have interviewed because, professionally, I try to get around. Back in 2021, I chatted with actor Justin Long and his brother Christian about a film they made, ""Lady of the Manor."" They were a hoot, and you don't have to take my word for it. ""Life is Short with Justin Long"" is a podcast in which the brothers talk to folks who fascinate them -- from actors to deep thinkers. In one of the most recent episodes, we even learn about Long's engagement to actress Kate Bosworth.  The Wondery podcast is available via various streaming services.  Cannot wait to watch... ""My Name Is Mo'Nique"" It's safe to safe to say that Mo'Nique and Netflix have settled their differences. The comedian and Oscar-winning actress had sued the streaming service in 2019 for alleged pay discrimination.  That case was settled and now her comedy special, ""My Name is Mo'Nique"" is streaming on Netflix. Expect it to be as raw and irreverent as the woman who does not shy away from speaking her mind. ""Beef"" Sign me up for anything starring Steven Yeun and Ali Wong.  They star as two people who almost collide while driving in a parking lot and the result is an intriguing dramedy. Satire rooted in road rage? If anyone could pull it off it's Yeun and Wong. I'm in for the ride!

                      One of the doctor's treating Jeremy Renner following his snowplow incident says the actor has come a long way incredibly quickly. Dr. Christopher Vincent, a chiropractic sports physician, spoke to CNN's Alisyn Camerota Friday night from Winter Park, Colorado, about the rehab process for Renner, an Oscar-nominated star of Marvel's ""Avengers"" movies and ""The Hurt Locker."" Vincent says the machine came within millimeters of hitting a vital organ or major nerve. ""As unlucky as he is to have such a tragic injury, he is so lucky that the injuries are where they are,"" Vincent said. Renner was crushed by a snowplow on New Year's Day and broke several bones including eight ribs, an eye socket, a knee and shoulder. ""He's pushing through it and really has the determination to not only heal but come back stronger and better than he was before,"" Vincent said. Renner will likely have some form of rehab for the rest of his life, but Vincent said he has a drive to overcome the pain and the injuries.

                      Jeremy Renner sat down with Diane Sawyer for his first interview since being crushed by a snow plow he was operating on New Year's Day. The Marvel star was the subject of ""Jeremy Renner: The Diane Sawyer Interview -- A Story of Terror, Survival and Triumph,"" which detailed the accident at his Nevada home and Renner's recovery. Here's some of what we  learned: Saving his nephew It had been reported that Renner was attempting to save his adult nephew, Alex, when the accident occurred and the actor shared during the interview exactly what happened. According to Renner, the pair had towed a vehicle out of the snow using the snow plow when it began to slide on the ice. Out of concern for his nephew's safety, Renner stuck his foot out of the plow to look back at Alex and fell out of the cab. Because he had forgotten to put the parking  brake on, the actor was pulled under the moving plow, which weighs more than 14,000 pounds. ""You shouldn't be outside the vehicle when you're operating it, you know what I mean,"" Renner recounted. ""It's like driving a car with one foot out of the car."" Noting that the accident was ""my mistake and I paid for it,"" the ""Hawkeye"" star said he screamed, ""Not today, motherf---er!"" as he was being sucked under the plow.  Despite the accident which left him severely injured, Renner has no regrets. ""Yeah, I'd do it again because it was going right at my nephew,"" he said. The devastation  Renner's injuries included eight ribs broken in 14 places, a broken eye socket, broken knee, a collapsed lung and his liver pierced from a rib bone. His neighbors Rich Kovach and Barb Fletcher assisted Renner's nephew in helping him after the accident. Both spoke of the trauma during the interview. ""It was a horrible sound to listen to someone, just literally watching somebody die in front of you,"" Fletcher said. ""You feel so helpless."" Kovach said there was a great deal of blood involved in the accident and ""when I looked at his head, it appeared to me to be cracked wide open."" Fletcher said she believes Renner may have died at some point. ""I really feel he did pass away for a couple of seconds,"" she said. ""I really do."" His recuperation  Renner was eventually airlifted to a hospital in Reno, Nevada. His doctors believe Renner being in going shape prior to the accident assisted in both his survival and recovery, but it was extremely touch and go. So much so that Renner said he was making end of life plans for himself.  ""I'm writing down notes in my phone... last words to my family,"" he told Sawyer. ""Don't let me live on tubes on a machine, if my existence is going to be on drugs and painkillers. Let me go now."" These days, he has progressed to the point where he is able to walk with a cane and the actor is feeling grateful for his survival. When he looks in the mirror now, Renner said, ""I see a lucky man.""

                      S Club 7 singer Paul Cattermole has died at the age of 46, weeks after the British pop group announced a major reunion tour. ""We are truly devastated by the passing of our brother Paul,"" Cattermole's bandmates said in a post on Twitter Friday. ""There are no words to describe the deep sadness and loss we all feel. We were so lucky to have had him in our lives and are thankful for the amazing memories we have."" ""He will be so deeply missed by each and every one of us. We ask that you respect the privacy of his family and of the band at this time."" A statement from his family and the group, obtained by the UK's PA Media news agency, said Friday: ""It is with great sadness that we announce the unexpected passing of our beloved son and brother Paul Cattermole."" ""Paul was found yesterday, 6th April 2023 at his home in Dorset and was pronounced dead later that afternoon."" The cause of death is unknown, but Dorset Police ""confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances,"" the statement added. CNN has contacted S Club 7's representatives. Formed in the late 1990s, pop group S Club 7 had four UK Number 1 singles and a UK chart-topping album. Hits included ""Never Had A Dream Come True,"" ""Bring It All Back,"" ""Don't Stop Movin'"" and ""Have You Ever."" Its members included Rachel Stevens, Jo O'Meara, Tina Barrett, Jon Lee and Bradley McIntosh. The group also had its own television show, originally called ""Miami 7, "" which aired on the BBC.  In 2002, Cattermole said that he was leaving S Club 7 to play with his old band Skua. ""It had got to the point where things were being handled so badly, I had to go,"" he told the Guardian in 2019. S Club -- the group's new name following Cattermole's departure -- eventually split in 2003. ""It was five years of my life,"" Cattermole told the Guardian. ""I definitely thought, when I was 20, that by the time I was 40 it would be a done thing. And it's not ... I've been answering S Club questions for 20 years. It will be great -- it will be bliss -- to one day not have to, but it's part of it, and I totally accept that."" Earlier this year, the pop group announced dates for their 25th anniversary reunion tour in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

                      It all started with a little curiosity. A team of ProPublica reporters earlier this year began looking into the travel of various Supreme Court justices, not entirely sure what they would find, if anything. But after a little digging, the trio of journalists stumbled upon something that piqued their interest.  In fact, what they uncovered raised their eyebrows to such a degree that they believed the discovery was an explosive story in its own right: a trip that Clarence Thomas had taken aboard billionaire Harlan Crow's private jet between Connecticut and Washington, D.C. But their editors encouraged the team to keep working the story, Justin Elliott, a member of the reporting team, told me by phone on Thursday. ""So we started grinding,"" Elliot explained. A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. From there, the story quickly grew in size and scope. ""It snowballed,"" Elliott said. Elliot and his co-authors, Joshua Kaplan and Alex Mierjeski, assembled a spreadsheet comprised of hundreds of people, methodically contacting potential sources as they built the story. ""The progress was gratifyingly steady,"" Elliot told me, cautioning, however, that ""it was not easy."" Easy or not, the final product that published on Thursday morning was unquestionably worth the effort. The bombshell report included stunning details that accuse Thomas of having accepted ultra-luxury vacations and private jet travel from a Republican mega-donor for decades. Even worse? ""These trips appeared nowhere on Thomas' financial disclosures,"" the ProPublica team wrote. ""His failure to report the flights appears to violate a law passed after Watergate that requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to disclose most gifts, two ethics law experts said."" The story landed with a bang, shaking the political world and immediately eliciting statements of serious concern from legal experts and Washington lawmakers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said in a statement that the report was ""a call to action."" Durbin added that ""the Senate Judiciary Committee will act."" What ultimately happens remains to be seen. But the immense fallout has already underscored the importance of journalism produced by non-profit newsrooms like ProPublica.  ""From my perspective as a reporter,"" Elliott told me, ""I feel so lucky to have the reporting resources and time resources to do a heavy lift like this. There are not that many places where you can do that anymore. So we are grateful to have jobs at ProPublica. ""If there are any rich people reading,"" Elliott added, ""give your money to nonprofit journalism.""

                      Longtime soccer journalist Grant Wahl played a significant role in shaping ""Ted Lasso."" In the most recent episode, the show honored his impact. At the end of episode four of Season 3, titled ""Big Week,"" the line ""In memory of Grant Wahl"" appears on the screen as the credits begin to roll. Earlier in the episode, Brendan Hunt, who plays Coach Beard, is seen holding Wahl's book ""The Beckham Experiment,"" analyzing David Beckham's move from Europe to Major League Soccer. Wahl collapsed and died last year while covering the World Cup in Qatar, due to what was later revealed to be a ruptured aortic aneurysm.  Dr. Céline Gounder, Wahl's widow, posted about the episode on Twitter, thanking the ""Ted Lasso"" team for the remembrance. ""This episode means so much to me and my family,"" she wrote.  Hunt, also an executive producer for the show, said Wahl played a huge role in developing the character of Trent Crimm, a journalist who spends Season 3 shadowing the fictional AFC Richmond club for a book he's writing.  Wahl covered the LA Galaxy, the team Beckham joined when he moved to the US, in a similar way -- and they thought of his book immediately to use as an Easter egg in the show, Hunt said in a statement to CNN. ""We exchanged emails about his experience and he was extremely generous with his answers to our questions,"" Hunt said. ""Grant's death happened while we were in post-production, and it was pretty self-evident that we would commemorate him in some way; the episode where his book is shown seemed the most organic place for it ..."" he continued. ""His death remains jarring and tragic. He will forever be missed."" Wahl was a preeminent soccer journalist who spent years covering the sport in the US at a time when soccer was only on the periphery of most Americans' consciousness.  ""He was almost a missionary in that sense,"" British football commentator Jon Champion previously told CNN. ""He would travel around the globe, telling people to take American soccer seriously. If you ask any of the frontline European football journalists who their first port of call has been if they wanted a story in America, it would be Grant Wahl.""  Wahl was also an early fan of ""Ted Lasso,"" interviewing the cast for his podcast in 2020 and visiting Hunt in Richmond last year.  ""Ted Lasso"" has since become a hit for Apple TV+, winning multiple Emmy awards and becoming one of the top shows from the streamer. Just last month, the cast even met with President Joe Biden to discuss mental health.

In the new film, Bailey plays Sam, an aspiring, young singer who must join her cousin's struggling, praise team in the lead-up to a national competition. The role feels tailor-made for Bailey, one half of the sibling singing duo Chlöe x Halle. ""It's my first movie I've stared in, so to be able to do it with my love of music and God all combined, it's s been pretty cool and I'm so grateful,"" Bailey told CNN.

Producer Will Packer told CNN he viewed this project similarly to his 2007 film, ""Stomp The Yard."" ""'Stomp the Yard,' while masquerading as a dance movie, was really about telling the story of Black colleges and fraternity and sororities at Black colleges, which was a world I knew well,"" he said. ""I have an affinity for the church and faith-based stories. Whether you're somebody that doesn't even know praise teams exist, I wanted to draw you into this world and then tell this story of a young girl who's trying to find her voice, who's trying to find her connection with her spirituality when she feels like she's lost."" Packer said he had Bailey in mind for the lead role from the start. ""She reminds me of Beyoncé. And by that I mean, not in the ways that other people have compared and other people think about, you know, her and Beyoncé as singers and actresses,"" he explained. ""I mean in terms of her work ethic. Chloe works very hard. You're not gonna outwork her."" That makes sense given that Bailey and her sister, who is set to star in the live-action ""Little Mermaid"" film being released in May,"" are protégés of Beyoncé. Anjelika Washington, who costars in ""Praise This"" as Sam's ""sister cousin"" Jess, told CNN she hopes the film will inspire audiences to be kind to one another. ""I hope that people remember to just love people,"" Washington said. ""That's the greatest command of all, so I hope that people have an open mind for everything."" Bailey agreed. ""I truly believe that God accepts us in every shape and form, and we should come exactly as we are,"" Bailey said. ""(The movie) shows that in such a positive light with comedy, and I hope audiences love it.""  Director Tina Gordon also has high hopes for ""Praise This"" and other projects like it.  ""I'm hoping that family-based projects, faith-based projects have a bigger and bigger home in Hollywood,"" she said. ""I actually think community is very important and entertainment that sort of fosters family, that multi-generations can watch together. We definitely learned that people want that over the last couple years."" ""Praise This"" also costars Druski, along with Grammy-nominated artists Quavo and Tristan Mack Wilds.  ""Praise This"" debuts on April 7 streams on Peacock.

In an amendment to rules covering digital and social media published Thursday, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said that the fact-checking would apply to information about ""any business of the central government"" on social media platforms.  The Editors Guild of India, a nonprofit organization representing more than 200 journalists, said in a statement on Friday that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by the new rules, saying they had ""deeply adverse implications"" for press freedom in India. Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a minister in the IT ministry, told Indian news agency ANI on Friday that the updated rules did not represent ""censoring at all,"" and that social media companies could choose to continue to share content that fell foul of the fact-checking process, but there would be consequences if they did.  If these companies failed to take down the offending content, Chandrasekhar said, they would lose the automatic legal protection they currently enjoy against complaints about third-party content on their platforms. That would open up the possibility for aggrieved parties, including government ministries, to take them to court.  ""The dangers of misinformation, the impact of patently false information in a democracy like ours, is never to be underestimated,"" Chandrasekhar said.  'Absolute power'  The Editors Guild expressed alarm that there was no mention in the rules of ""what will be the governing mechanism for such a fact-checking unit, the judicial oversight, [or] the right to appeal.""   ""In effect, the government has given itself absolute power to determine what is fake or not, in respect of its own work, and order take down,"" the guild added. It urged the government to withdraw the rule change and consult with media organizations. Twitter and Facebook, which both have a significant presence in India, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Concern has been brewing in recent months over the Indian government's increasingly restrictive stance towards the media.  In February, Indian tax authorities searched the BBC's offices in Delhi and Mumbai, accusing the British broadcaster of tax evasion. The incident came nearly a month after the government used emergency powers to block the release of a documentary about Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Modi has been accused of silencing his critics in recent months. A senior member of India's opposition Congress party was arrested in February for allegedly insulting the prime minister.  And last month, the former leader of the party — Rahul Gandhi — was disqualified as a lawmaker after a court found him guilty of defamation. He was convicted over a speech he made in 2019, in which he referred to thieves as having the same surname as Modi.

                      Molly Shannon is so excited to return to ""Saturday Night Live,"" she showed up three days early. In anticipation of her hosting gig this Saturday, she asks in a promotional clip, ""Where is everyone?"" A crew member replies, ""They don't come in until Saturday."" ""It's OK. I'm just gonna wait back here for the next few days so I'm ready for the big show,"" Shannon, who was a main cast member on ""SNL"" from 1995 to 2001, replies. She also returned to host in 2007. Shannon has gone on to star in ""Other People,"" ""The White Lotus,"" and ""Divorce,"" among many other roles. But fans of the actress and comedian remember her time at ""SNL"" well. Here are five of Shannon's iconic characters we can't forget.  Mary Katherine Gallagher Shannon's Mary Katherine is a teenage Catholic school girl who swings between hyperactive and shy, but ultimately knows she's a ""superstar."" The time she competes in a sing-off with Whitney Houston is classic. Mary Katherine was the star of the 1999 movie ""Superstar,"" starring Shannon and Will Ferrell. Sally O'Malley Shannon's Sally O'Malley is ""50 years old!"" She can stretch and kick and shimmy and kick again. The time she tries out for the Rockettes wearing her signature red two-piece and her animal print purse is a classic.  ""When do I start?"" she asks.

Terry Rialto on NPR In ""The Delicious Dish,"" Shannon played a smooth-voiced radio food show host with Ana Gasteyer. The two would innocently use risqué double entendres without realizing they weren't really describing food. Southern Gals Shannon is fantastic as a Southern woman who is visiting New York with her girlfriends. She's thrilled by ""the lady in Times Square"" who brushed her hair then ""squatted down to take a little pee."" She describes seeing ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, but likes the movie better. When a rat sits on her shoulder in a pizza place, she charmingly says, ""It looks like I made a little friend."" Shannon hosts ""SNL"" April 8.

                      'Beef' turns a road-rage run-in into one of the year's juiciest shows

                      Netflix makes an early bid for the year's juiciest new series with ""Beef,"" a twisty, dark and stellar showcase for Steven Yeun and Ali Wong in which the escalating fallout from a road-rage encounter spirals out of control. Disarmingly funny and increasingly nasty, it should make everyone think twice before honking at that idiot stranger who just pulled out in front of you. That's where it all begins for Danny Cho (""The Walking Dead's"" Yeun), a struggling contractor working with his unambitious brother Paul (Young Mazino), after he nearly backs into Amy Lau (Ali Wong, impressively flexing her dramatic acting chops after a standup career, including the recent ""Paper Girls""), a successful yuppie entrepreneur and mom on the verge of cashing in by selling her company to a wealthy art snob (Maria Bello). One pointedly extended finger later, the chase is on, leaving both Danny and Amy eager to settle the score, prompting a game of tit-for-tat that gradually begins to inflict pretty significant collateral damage on those around them, including Amy's husband George (Joseph Lee), who is somehow oblivious to the simmering anger that his wife carries around inside her. Series creator Lee Sung Jin has worked predominantly in sitcoms, which explains the darkly comic streak that runs through many of the situations. But the weird turns definitely have a dramatic side, which makes ""Beef"" as hard to characterize as it is to stop watching. Part of that has to do with the deft way the series peels back layers regarding the key players and their relationships, including past actions that have major consequences in terms of the pivotal conflict. Those sequences help explain the chips on their shoulders that might lead Amy and Danny to risk so much on a seemingly pointless feud. The fact that the series features a predominantly Asian-American cast is easily overlooked given the device that sets it all in motion, but show effortlessly weaves elements of cultural specificity into the proceedings, including Danny's sudden and not-too-convincing interest in the Korean church, and the pressure he feels regarding his obligations to his parents as well as his brother. Perhaps foremost, ""Beef"" organically advances the story in a way that carefully builds in absurdity as the bad choices and retaliation pile up upon each other. It's also that rare streaming series that doesn't feel as if it's straining or vamping to flesh out 10 episodes. The simplicity of the premise, in that sense, belies how intricately it all unfolds. Danny and Amy might not appear to have in common, but they share a hidden bond in their seemingly inexhaustible supply of pettiness and hostility. ""Beef"" takes that dynamic, marinates in it, and somehow serves up a four-star meal. ""Beef"" premieres April 6 on Netflix.

                      'Unstable' unleashes Rob Lowe in an uninspired father-son Netflix comedy

                      It's nice to see families working together, even in the jaded confines of Hollywood. But ""Unstable"" plays a little too conspicuously like a father-and-son bonding opportunity for Rob Lowe and John Owen Lowe, yielding a breezy Netflix comedy series that's so lightweight it could easily just blow away. The origins of the show actually grew out of the younger Lowe trolling his famous dad via social media, prompting the producers (of which Rob Lowe is one) to look for a showcase to exploit that dynamic. The not-terribly-original result casts the elder Lowe as Ellis Dragon, a wealthy biotech entrepreneur who goes from ""eccentric"" to ""off the deep end"" after the death of his wife. Worried that Ellis' behavior might imperil the company, the company's management -- lead by buttoned-up chief financial officer Anna (Sian Clifford) -- enlist his son, Jackson, to come work for him, hoping that having the kid around will provide a stabilizing (hence the title) influence. Yet Jackson has headed off on his own for a reason, seeking to escape his dad's sizable shadow. As developed by Victor Fresco (a veteran sitcom writer whose credits include ""Santa Clarita Diet"" and ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe""), once you get past the family part of the premise ""Unstable"" becomes a sort-of variation on ""30 Rock,"" with a lot of outlandish talent that needs to be coddled in order to keep the place running. The dynamic almost immediately includes a romantic triangle built around Jackson, who draws the attention of two genius lab workers, Ruby (Emma Ferreira) and Luna (Rachel Marsh), the first overt about her interest in him, the latter shyly hiding behind her glasses and a boyfriend that she doesn't actually like all that much. There's actually a sweetness if a little too much familiarity around those situations, but beyond the obvious hook of allowing Lowe to completely unleash his silly side (see the ""Austin Powers"" movies), the series veers into cartoon-character territory with the board members who are out to dethrone Ellis and a therapist (Fred Armisen) who gets sucked into his outlandish orbit. Granted, there's something to be said for a comedy that doesn't aspire to much more than being funny, and while John Owen Lowe (who previously appeared with his dad in the A&E unscripted series ""The Lowe Files"") holds his own in terms of dashing off one-liners, this is hardly the first example of a Hollywood production motivated by take-your-child-to-work-day underpinnings. ""Unstable"" isn't bad, in that context, but the ""un"" that most comes to mind actually goes with ""necessary."" ""Unstable"" premieres March 30 on Netflix.

                      The live action remake of ""The Little Mermaid"" will have updated lyrics to include consent, the songwriter has said. The classic Disney movie, originally released as an animation in 1989, has been updated to reflect changing social attitudes towards consent, according to composer Alan Menken, who wrote the soundtrack to the original movie with Howard Ashman. Songs ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" will include new lyrics to reflect this shift. Menken collaborated with American songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda on the live-action remake, which will premiere next month. ""There are some lyric changes in 'Kiss the Girl' because people have gotten very sensitive about the idea that [Prince Eric] would, in any way, force himself on [Ariel],"" Menken said in an interview with Vanity Fair last week. In the movie, Ariel makes a deal with sea witch Ursula to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can explore the world above water and impress Prince Eric. In the animated classic, Ariel must secure the kiss of ""true love"" within three days, or else she transforms back into a mermaid and will belong to Ursula. The song's lyrics urge Prince Eric to kiss Ariel before it's too late.  In the original lyrics to ""Kiss the Girl,"" Sebastian, Ariel's crab pal, sings: ""Yes, you want her. Look at her, you know you do. Possible she wants you, too. There is one way to ask her. It don't take a word. Not a single word. Go on and kiss the girl."" ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" has also been revised, Menken said, because the original contained ""lines that might make young girls somehow feel that they shouldn't speak out of turn, even though Ursula is clearly manipulating Ariel to give up her voice."" ""The men up there don't like a lot of blabber. They think a girl who gossips is a bore,"" sings Ursula in the original track. ""Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word. And after all, what is idle babble for?"" Ursula advises Ariel: ""It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man."" The new lyrics to the songs have not yet been revealed. The remake directed by Rob Marshall and is set to premiere in theaters on May 26. It features Halle Bailey as Ariel, Melissa McCarthy as Ursula, Jonah Hauer-King as Prince Eric and Javier Bardem as King Triton.

                      Fox asks judge to bar references to January 6 attack at Dominion trial

                      Fox asked a judge in court filings made public Thursday to prohibit references to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, as well as threats directed at employees of Dominion Voting Systems, when the $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit it faces from the election technology company goes to trial later this month. ""Dominion's defamation claim has nothing to do with the Capitol riot,"" Fox's lawyers argued in the court filings. ""And any reference to the Capitol riot will only unfairly prejudice the jury against Fox, inflame passions, prevent a fair trial, and taint any resulting verdict."" Fox added that threats against Dominion employees ""were horrific and absolutely inexcusable."" But the company said ""allowing Dominion to discuss specific threats and their effect on employees is virtually guaranteed to arouse the jury's sympathy and provoke a desire to punish Fox for the actions of unrelated third parties."" The documents made public Thursday are ""motions in limine,"" which are pretrial efforts by both sides to block certain evidence and arguments from being used during the trial. These motions are common in criminal and civil proceedings. Depending on how the judge rules, the outcome of these motions could significantly shape the trial, potentially giving one side an advantage.  Both Fox and Dominion filed a slew of these pretrial motions last month, but they were under seal. They filed public versions of the documents on Thursday, in accordance with an order from the judge. Media outlets had pressed the judge for more transparency, and to unseal these and other documents. In the documents, Fox additionally asked the judge to bar references to the company's financial information and the state of mind of its employees, arguing both were irrelevant to the case. Dominion strongly disagreed with all of Fox's requests, filing motions of opposition against them. Dominion's lawyers argued that the attack on the U.S. Capitol ""is central to almost every element of this case, and the Court should reject Fox's motion in its entirety."" Dominion also argued that references to threats its employees faced in the aftermath of the 2020 are relevant to the case, contending in court filings that it is ""evidence that Fox's lies destroyed Dominion's reputation and enterprise value."" Dominion's lawyers said that ""people are unlikely to want to work for, contract with, or acquire a business that is besieged by death threats and harassment."" ""It also became incredibly difficult for Dominion to retain and win business because would-be customers themselves are inundated with death threats, harassment, and protests related to Dominion,"" Dominion's lawyers added. The judge said Wednesday that he'll address these motions next week, at an in-person hearing on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware. He might rule on the motions during that hearing, or he could issue written opinions later on. The judge said at a Wednesday hearing related to jury questions that he does not ""see January 6 as relevant in this case,"" perhaps signaling how he could rule on Fox's motion in limine. Dominion, for its part, moved to block Fox News from bringing up emails from one of its top officials who wrote in October 2020 that ""our s**t is just riddled with bugs,"" according to court filings made public Thursday.  Fox News has never argued in court that Dominion rigged the 2020 election, but its lawyers have repeatedly made the point that there are longstanding and bipartisan security concerns about its voting machines. ""Fox's motions attempt to narrow Dominion's kitchen sink legal approach and return focus to the core issues,"" a Fox News spokesperson said in a Thursday statement, ""including documents that show that Dominion's then director of product strategy & security criticized its software by stating 'our s*** is just riddled with bugs' and their CEO saying, 'no customer cares about the media.' Such internal admissions by Dominion directly contradict their case, which is why they continue to push distracting and irrelevant materials in their quest for a payday."" A trial is scheduled to begin April 17, unless the parties reach a last-minute settlement. Fox News has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, maintained it is ""proud"" of its 2020 election coverage, and argued that Dominion's lawsuit represents a threat to the First Amendment. While Fox's legal liability will be decided at trial, the case has already battered Fox's reputation. Incriminating texts and emails have shown how Fox executives, hosts and producers didn't believe the claims the network was peddling about Dominion. These revelations drove a dagger through the idea that Fox News is anything but a partisan GOP operation focused on ratings — not journalism. The lawsuit is seen as one of the most consequential defamation cases in recent memory. Fox has argued that a loss will eviscerate press freedoms, and many scholars agree that the bar should remain high to prove defamation. Other analysts have said holding Fox accountable for knowingly airing lies won't pose a threat to objective journalists who would never do that in the first place. The case has elicited a mountain of evidence exposing Fox News as a right-wing profit machine lacking the most basic journalistic ethics — and willing to promote unhinged election conspiracy theories to preserve its lucrative business.

                      Mick Mars, guitarist for the 1980's heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the band that he was a part of for four decades. Mars is requesting that seven corporate entities associated with Mötley Crüe hand over records related to their business dealings following a 2022 dispute stemming from Mars notifying the band that he'd be retiring from touring due to a medical condition. Mars claims the band subsequently attempted to oust him altogether and diminish future earnings he claims he's entitled to, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by CNN. ""It is beyond sad that, after 41 years together, a band would try to throw out a member who is unable to tour anymore because he has a debilitating disease. Mick has been pushed around for far too long in this band, and we are not going to let that continue,"" Ed McPherson, the attorney representing Mars who filed the lawsuit on Thursday, told CNN in a statement.  McPherson said in the suit that when Mars notified Mötley Crüe that he'd retire from touring due to his ""debilitating"" Ankylosing Spondylitis, a condition that mainly affects the spine, he made it clear that he had no intention of leaving the band, that he could still record with them and still perform with them in a ""residency situation."" The suit alleges the band then called an emergency shareholders meeting for Mötley Crüe's main corporate entity ""in order to throw Mars out of the band, to fire him as a director of the corporation, to fire him as an officer of the corporation, and to take away his shares of the corporation.""  Sasha Frid, litigation counsel for Mötley Crüe, told CNN in a statement that Mars's lawsuit is ""unfortunate and completely off-base,"" and that Mars, and the other members of Mötley Crüe, signed a 2008 agreement that ""in no event shall any resigning shareholder be entitled to receive any monies attributable to live performances (i.e., tours)."" Frid's statement continued to say that after Mars publicly resigned from Mötley Crüe, ""the band offered Mick a generous compensation package to honor his career with the band"" despite ""the fact that the band did not owe Mick anything."" The lawsuit also outlines years of frayed relationships and tumult among members of the band, including allegations that various members performed some songs to pre-recorded tracks while on tour and that bassist Nikki Sixx ""gaslighted"" Mars, creating a false narrative that Mars was making mistakes on tour because of cognitive dysfunction.  McPherson noted in the suit that any errors Mars may have made while on tour were due to his in-ear monitors ""constantly malfunctioning, causing Mars to be unable to hear his own instrument."" ""Mötley Crüe always performs its songs live but during the last tour Mick struggled to remember chords, played the wrong songs and made constant mistakes which led to his departure from the band,"" Frid said in the band's statement.  Mötley Crüe famously reunited in 2019 and announced a new tour after performing what was supposed to be their last show at the end of 2015.

Rossum kept the news secret that she and ""Mr. Robot"" creator Esmail were expecting until Thursday's birth announcement.

And while his wife Jennifer Lopez has Puerto Rican heritage, Affleck learned the language in his youth. He told Kelly Clarkson on her daytime talk show that when he was 13, he lived in Mexico for a year filming a television show where he picked up the language. Affleck also shared that his daughter Violet with ex-wife Jennifer Garner was studying Spanish in school and had gotten so good that it had encouraged him to improve his language skills so that she would not surpass him. ""I don't mind that I can't do your math homework, but you are not gonna be better at Spanish than me,"" he joked.

                      A Brooklyn man charged in the overdose death of actor and producer Michael K. Williams pleaded guilty Wednesday to drug distribution charges. Irvin Cartagena, who also goes by ""Green Eyes,"" was one of four men charged for being part of a drug trafficking organization that sold deadly fentanyl-laced heroin to Williams. Cartagena pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute fentanyl, heroin and other drugs. Prosecutors allege that Cartagena was the person who conducted the ""the hand-to-hand transaction"" with Williams just before the actor, best known for his role as Omar Little on HBO's ""The Wire,"" died of an accidental overdose. Williams was found dead in his New York City apartment in 2021 in what the New York City Medical Examiner's Officer ruled an accidental overdose. He was 54. ""Irvin Cartagena sold fentanyl-laced heroin in broad daylight in New York City, feeding addiction and causing tragedy,"" the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement Thursday. ""In doing so, he dealt the fatal dose that killed Michael K. Williams."" Cartagena, 39, faces a mandatory minimum of five years in prison but could face up to 40 years behind bars when he is sentenced by a federal judge. CNN reached out to Cartagena's lawyer for comment.  One of Cartagena's codefendants, Carlos Macci, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute narcotics on Tuesday, according to the court docket. The two other men charged, Hector Robles and Luis Cruz, have pleaded not guilty.

                      Lizzo has officially joined the ""Star Wars"" galaxy far, far away.  The ""About Damn Time"" singer surprised fans when she appeared in the latest episode of ""The Mandalorian"" as a noblewoman who becomes fast friends with young Grogu (Baby Yoda to the uninitiated).  She cameoed alongside Jack Black, who played her daffy husband. Lizzo floated onscreen as Duchess of the Outer Rim planet Plazir-15, and, from what viewers saw, she spends her time sipping on ""secretions"" and playing interstellar bocce with her court. Black as Captain Bombardier was by her side through it all, a former Imperial officer who fell for the Duchess when he was sent to Plazir for ""rehabilitation."" (He swore in the episode he has no Imperial leanings.)  When Mando, fellow Mandalorian Bo-Katan Kryze and, of course, Grogu enter her ""domed paradise,"" the Duchess and the baby quickly become close companions. The diminutive green creature even uses the Force to help the Duchess outscore her opponents in a lawn game that involved tossing balled-up, centipede-like creatures through a series of hoops.  Later in the episode, Doc Brown himself appears -- Christopher Lloyd of ""Back to the Future"" played the planet's security head Commissioner Helgait, who oversees the reprogrammed battle droids that citizens of Plazir task with carrying shopping bags or valeting ships.  Later, it's revealed that Helgait, a Separatist loyal to the Sith Count Dooku, purposely messed with some of the droids so they'd malfunction. Lizzo's Duchess gravely exiles him on their planet's moon -- and then lovingly knights Grogu for being his sweet self.  Lizzo is an avowed fan of Grogu -- in 2021, she painted herself green and donned a beige robe and pointy ears to portray the young Force-sensitive alien for Halloween.  Sharing images of herself traipsing around Hollywood in costume, Lizzo facetiously wrote on Instagram: ""A representative from Grogu's publicity team has issued a statement regarding the paparazzi photos taken last night: 'Grogu aka Baby Yoda aka The Child has no recollection of these events. In fact, these events never happened *jedi hand wave*'""  The Emmy and Grammy winner celebrated her appearance on ""The Mandalorian"" with a selfie, flanked by countless Grogu stuffed animals and figurines: ""I'm in Star Wars YALL!""

                      'Paint' feels like a trailer in search of a movie, with Owen Wilson as a Bob Ross-type artist

                      ""Paint"" can't seem to decide what it wants to be, and ends up being nothing much at all, once you get past the visual of Owen Wilson under a Bob Ross hairdo. As so often happens, the net result is a fuzzy picture, and a coming-attraction trailer in search of a movie. Wilson might look and sound like Ross, the PBS icon whose dirty laundry got a recent airing in a Netflix documentary, ""Bob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed,"" but for these purposes call him Carl Nargle, a fixture at a Vermont public-TV station for the last 22 years. Carl's hushed, soothing whispers not only hypnotize audiences, but they're near-irresistible to most of the women at the station, who seem eager to line up for a turn to visit his van. The exception would be his producer, Katherine (Michaela Watkins), although that stems from a history between them, as flashbacks eventually reveal. When Carl rejects a pitch from the station manager, Tony (Stephen Root), to host a second hour, the station puts on a show just like Carl's ""Paint,"" only with a younger artist named Ambrosia (Ciara Renée, who plays Hawkgirl in DC's TV universe). Tony being one of those corporate types who can't resist saying exactly what's on his mind, he confesses that the hope is Ambrosia will become popular enough to render Carl obsolete. Yet what could play like some cutthroat dark comedy, a Christopher Guest-like satire or merely a broadly silly lark never really settles on a tone. Part of that has to do with an inability to convey what really makes Carl tick beyond his yearning to be taken seriously, and the fact that he's a middle-aged guy who doesn't adjust well to change -- whose career and fragile ego get threatened by a younger woman of color -- feels decidedly underdeveloped. Marking the feature debut for writer-director Brit McAdams, ""Paint"" most charitably works as an homage to Ross and the understated, comforting form of entertainment that he and other early public-TV staples represented, without really saying much about its inspiration beyond the surface trappings. If movies start with their own version of a blank canvas, ""Paint"" splashes on a few pretty colors but, ultimately, proves about as exciting as watching you-know-what dry. ""Paint"" premieres April 7 in US theaters. It's rated PG-13.
